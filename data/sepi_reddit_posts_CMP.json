The page describes the differences between the two options:\n\nThe first option appears to allow a person to submit the form without explicitly they want to opt-in to anything.  You would have their personal data but Hubspot won't subscribe them to any lists.\n\n>With this option, *consent to process personal data* is collected implicitly when the contact clicks the submit button.\n\n>If a contact submitting the form doesn’t select the *consent to communicate* checkbox, the form submission will still be processed. However, the contact won't be subscribed to any communications.\n\nThe second option appears to force someone to check the box to explicitly\n\n>The contact needs to select the *consent to process data* checkbox in order to give their consent. You cannot process a visitor's data and accept the form submission if they have not given explicit consent for you to do so.\n\nFor the marketing form, I would choose the second option to make consent explicit. For marketing, it is safer that the user explicitly says they want you to use their personal data for a specific purpose than relying on implicit consent.  For the first option, once you have the personal data you don't know whether you will be able to use the personal data for anything (i.e. what would be your legal basis for processing their personal data - you don't really have any you can rely on).  I would not rely on legitimate interest (because your legitimate interest for marketing would override someone rights).\n\nFor your lead form, use the second option.  Add the legitimate interest option as you want to specify that you may need to process their personal data to maintain the relationship ship (such as processing their personal data in your CRM such as assigning sale persons to the lead, recording their needs, processing email communications between you and the lead.",

                "body": "Yes, many people use privacy policy generators to get most of the boilerplate out of the way. If you want to write this yourself, use Art 13–15 GDPR as a todo list. But GDPR compliance isn't just boilerplate, and no particular text or widget will make you compliant.\n\n* disclosure of address: that's the German Impressumspflicht from the TMG, not directly related to GDPR.\n* e-mail collection: must be covered in your privacy policy. If you use a third party company to handle emails, they must be your data processor\n* Google Analytics: sets cookies by default, so you need to obtain cookie consent before it is loaded. Which pretty much destroys the usefulness of your data. Also, Google should be your data processor in this context.\n* referral links: needs disclosure so that it's clear what is an ad and what isn't, but has no GDPR consequences.\n* US platforms: see discussion about data processors\n\nCookie consent is usually obtained via special consent management tools that display a popup. They can be helpful with some details, e.g. users should be able to consent to different categories of cookies separately. Note that you must not refuse access to your site if cookies are denied, though some publishers are using a consent–or–subscribe model that's likely legal.\n\nConsent is only explicitly required in specific cases, like cookies. In general, your processing activities of personal data (which includes even things such as IP addresses) just needs a legal basis under Art 6 GDPR. Consent is only one of many legal bases, with an important alternative being a legitimate interest (LI). LI requires you to do a balancing test between that interest and the affected person's rights (write the balancing test down!). So (other than for cookies) it is usually sufficient to provide transparent information about what you're doing, and to offer an opt-out where appropriate. Consent management tools often support legitimate interest opt-outs as well, though you will need to wire the consent management tool up accordingly. It's unlikely a no-code platform can do that :)\n\nOn using (international) data processors, i.e. outsourcing some activities to another company:\n\n* You need a contract with them that binds them to only use the data for your purposes, not for their own purposes. This is often called a “data processing addendum” or something like that. Sometimes included in the normals terms of service, but often a separate document. E.g. in Google Analytics you can sign a DPA in the account settings.\n* International transfers of personal data require disclosure in your privacy policy, and additional protections (e.g. Standard Contractual Clauses). Your life will be easier if you can avoid non-EU services.\n* The US do not offer an adequate level of data protection (see the Schrems II judgement). Privacy Shield is no longer valid. In theory nearly all uses of US services are forbidden in the EU, in practice this isn't yet enforced very strictly. In Germany, this depends very much on your state. E.g. I remember Berlin and MeckPom taking a harder stance on this issue, with Bavaria being more flexible.\n* Furthermore, US-based services often only have so-so features that aid with compliance. If a website builder can't defer certain actions until consent was given, that is a component.\n\nInstead of an US-based “no code” website builder, consider renting a managed Wordpress instance in the EU. Wordpress is extremely flexible and can do most things without having to code. But unfortunately this depends on third-party themes and plugins with very uneven quality.",

Per Art 13, you're only required to list “the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any” which includes your data processors.\n\n> I'm going with a managed WP from \\[redacted]\n\nI didn't mention WP because WP is so amazing, but because it allows you to avoid US-based services. As mentioned above, the US do not offer an adequate level of data protection, so it's a bit challenging to argue that you can send traffic there (said the Reddit user, writing on a US-based website…). *Technically* the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are still valid (which are often incorporated into a DPA), but in reality everyone knows that they are ineffective for transfers into the US. I previously said Bavaria was more chill about this, but today I learned that it [told one company to stop using Mailchimp](https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2021/bavarian-dpa-baylda-calls-german-company-cease-use-mailchimp-tool_en), an US-based company that suggests to use SCCs.\n\nEvery service says it's GDPR-compliant. But you are the data controller and you have to make the determination whether *you* can use their services in a GDPR-compliant manner.\n\nAlso, any hosting that requires you to pay > €10/month for a basic low-traffic WP installation is ripping you off :)  \nAnother common pricing trap is to charge separately for SSL certificates.\n\n> configuring Google Analytics to be cookie-less\n\nThis is indeed possible, just be aware that GA will generate a new client ID on each page load, so that user = session = pageview in your statistics. The feature to [disable cookies is documented for analytics.js](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookies-user-id#disabling_cookies), but there's an equivalent undocumented feature for gtag.js:\n\n    gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', {\n      'anonymize_ip': true,\n      'client_storage': 'none'  // do not set cookies\n    });\n\nAlso, GA is another US-based data processor :)\n\n> For the Impressum and Privacy Policy I can pay some generators, right?\n\nYes, though a free one might be sufficient. If you can live with a bit of risk, it's also quite feasible to look at the TMG and GDPR and provide that information yourself. The Impressum requirements get more important for Kaufmänner, since there's a thriving Abmahnindustrie.\n\n> do you have a preferred charity\n\nThank you for being so thoughtful. I'm fond of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/donate/) which provides legal infrastructure for open source projects, [NOYB.eu](https://noyb.eu/en/other-support-options) which does activism regarding GDPR enforcement, or [Médecins Sans Frontières](https://www.msf.org/donate) which carries out humanitarian efforts.",

Even if you had an LLC registered outside of the EU, you'd still work from EU and GDPR would likely still apply.\n\n> [MSF]\n\nThanks!\n\n> [Mailchimp] … except the fact that maybe US intelligence might snoop around\n\nThe core issue in Schrems II was not necessarily the surveillance – GDPR permits measures when they are necessary and proportionate for a democratic society. However, non-US persons that are affected by US surveillance have no realistic way to sue the US government. This violates the rule of law (Rechtsstaatlichkeit).\n\nIn the particular case regarding Mailchimp, the immediate issue was that the company hadn't assessed whether the transfers were still lawful and which supplemental measures would have to be taken to make it lawful. Since the company had just used Mailchimp for a couple of tests but didn't actively rely on it, they found it easier to just stop using it.\n\nMost of the industry just pretends that SCCs are a valid basis to continue such international transfers. It is technically true that SCCs were not invalidated by Schrems II, but there is a duty to ensure that the non-EU party is actually able to comply with this contract. While I can't recommend it with good conscience, you wouldn't be the first to just sign SCCs and be done with it.\n\n> if I should get \"caught\" […] there is no punishment involved but a notification\n\n*Typically* the data protection authorities don't immediately issue a fine.

Here, the EDPB focuses its further analysis on \"very large online platforms\" in the sense of the Digital Services Act (and \"gatekeepers\" in the sense of the Digital Markets Act). These platforms do not have a real alternative. If I decline to use Facebook, then I'm locked out of a large part of public life. So these VLOPs merit close scrutiny when thinking about how large of a fee (if any) may be charged as an alternative to giving consent. Here, the application of data protection law is closely intertwined with fair competition law.\n\nThe analysis is more complicated when we're looking at smaller online services, as these competition law factors become less prominent. It's fairly easy to argue that Facebook's paid tier was manipulative bullshit, it is more difficult to argue that the various Zeit Online subscription tiers are impermissible.\n\nPersonally, I believe that Pay or OK is in principle permissible as long as the paid tier and ad-supported tier are balanced to be of equivalent value.\n\n* However, the paid tiers are often many times more expensive than the lost ad revenue they allegedly replace. To me, this *looks* like they often aren't intended as a realistic alternative, but as a manipulation tactic to coerce people into giving consent – often to exploit the \"decoy effect\" to drive consumers to a higher-priced subscription with added features.\n* This also runs into problems of \"granularity\". A website will often ask for consent for multiple different purposes, and the GDPR expects that data subjects can decide to which purposes they give consent.

What the EDPB is saying is that they should consider offering a third option that doesn’t involve consenting or paying, because you don’t have the “third option” of just not using them and going somewhere else, like you do with other smaller companies.\n\nUltimately it’s always case by case; whatever options a company offers, they will need to be able to show that any consent they’re relying on is freely given, and that’s going to be partly dependent on how “big” they are, in the sense of how dominant/ubiquitous a position they occupy in the market.\n\nIf what you’re saying is you just don’t like any website being able to charge you to say no to cookies, there’s ultimately no requirement on any company to offer you a service at all and they have to be able to monetise their content. GDPR doesn’t dictate what business models can and can’t be used, as long as you’re able to satisfy its requirements.",

        "id": "1jnqbi2",
        "selftext": "I'd be grateful for some guidance on the potential breach aspects of this scenario:\n\nI raised a complaint to my employer that a verbal meeting I had with two managers had been recorded. Long story short, a very detailed record, tantamount to a verbatim transcript, was made by them, and documented on my HR record. \n\nI was not told any notes or transcript was being taken. The content of their write up omits key information. The topic was my health, diagnosis of a disability, and the entire thing was a disagreement about aspects of this. I was not offered the record to scrutinise, and consider it innacurate. I believe it it is fundamentally special category data. \n\nI only learned if it by way of a DSAR request. I've since learned the original document remained stored on the personal drive of one of the managers, named incorrectly, and the contents cut and pasted in a Teams message to the other manager for them to quality assure. The original draft transcript can be evidenced to have been edited, and the final version is therefore a biased account of the discussion. My position is that the meeting was a formal capability meeting by stealth, but they claim it was an 'informal meeting', so weren't required to tell me the record was being made, nor give me the chance to take my own notes or have anyone present to assist. They document it elsewhere as being a 'welfare discussion', which is not a formal title with any definition. It ran for nearly an hour after saying it would be a 15 min chat, and resulted in the most detailed transcript I've ever seen. Routine and inconsequential 121s always had notes, but this exceeded those by nearly 400% in equivalent content.\n\nI've also learned that during the meeting one manager made notes for themselves on topics to cover, but did it in a Teams message to the other which they 'accidentally' sent. They also admit to storing notes of this and other meetings for 'their own records to refer back to', including disability-realted absence meetings.\n\nSo, no 'breach' in terms of my data being leaked externally etc. However, it seems to me this whole debacle falls down on just about every principle; transparency, accuracy and so on. Does the sharing of the notes via Teams, plus accidental sharing of a message, count as a leak of some form? Granted both parties were in the meeting anyway, but on what basis were they providing each other with a document of it to store and save? If nothing else it demonstrates a massive risk of data loss, i.e. could have cut and paste into the wrong conversation and hit send.\n\nThere was no reason not to get my consent, and to have not done so, they need to rely on another point in law do they not? And if they do so, don't they effectively admit they were running a formal process, as per my allegation it was a formal capability meeting by stealth? Otherwise, why does the record of the meeting exist? Does failing to adhere to the principles, and being lax with storage and sharing etc, amount to an objective offence in some way, or just 'bad practice', a near miss and 'do better next time'?\n\nThis all forms part of a much wider grievance, but as a standalone I'd like to get to grips with the specific angle around data breach, especially as it concerns special category data.

A funder’s data protection team has asked whether our Google Drive storage is UK/EU based, or if it is possible that the servers might be outside the EU/in the US. We’ve also had a request from a team member to use a new platform for recruitment whose servers are located in the US.\n\nI would appreciate advice on whether it is acceptable for us to use services which store data on servers outside of the EU, and how we can reassure funders and other partners that this is compliant with the GDPR. What kind of statement might we be required to add to our data privacy notices?\n\nGoogle Workspace offers a data regions functionality that allows users to restrict the storage of their data to a specific geographic location (Europe or USA) but we don’t qualify for this as we have a free Google Workspace for Nonprofits account.\n\nI contacted Google’s Workspace support, who stated that there is no general data location requirement under the GDPR, and for completeness and courtesy only, pointed me towards\nSection 10 (Data Locations Commitments) in connection with Appendix 3 (Specific Privacy Laws / European Data Protection Law, Section 4 (Data Transfers)) of the Google Cloud Data Processing Addendum: https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-addendum?hl=en which seems to indicate that any storage of data on US based servers is compliant with data protection law. \n\nI found guidance on the gov.uk website for UK businesses transferring data to the US which refers to a EU-US Data Privacy Framework. Once a US organisation has been certified and is publicly placed onto the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) List on the DPF website, they can receive UK personal data through a UK-US data bridge without the need for further safeguards set out in the UK GDPR. Google is on the list.  \n\nHere’s what we say in our data protection policy:\nThe GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA in most circumstances in order to ensure that the level of data protection afforded to individuals by the GDPR is not undermined. In this context, a “transfer” of personal data includes transmitting, sending, viewing or accessing personal data in or to a different country.\nWe may only transfer personal data outside of the EEA if one of the following conditions applies:\n1. The European Commission has issued an “adequacy decision” confirming that the\ncountry to which we propose transferring the personal data ensures an adequate\nlevel of protection for the rights and freedoms of individuals\n2. Appropriate safeguards are in place, such as binding corporate rules, standard\ncontractual clauses that have been approved by the European Commission or an\napproved code of conduct or certification mechanism \n3. The individual has given their explicit consent to the proposed transfer, having been\nfully informed of any potential risks\n4. The transfer is necessary in order to perform a contract between us and\nthe data subject, for reasons of public interest, to establish, exercise or defend legal\nclaims or to protect the vital interests of the individual in circumstances where they\nare in incapable of giving consent\n\nThank you.",

        "selftext": "Hi to everyone, \n\nI'm developing a minimal platform to handle beauty center appointments. The platform can be used by beauty center owner only, so no customers has an app. The platform allows registering customer information like name, surname and phone number. The phone number is used to send reminder 24h before.\n\nThe question is: should I request the customers to be agreed to use they phone number to send them a reminder? If yes, what is the best approach? I'm thinking to develop a flow where the owner of beauty center add a new customer by asking it the information and then the platform send a sms with an URL to a webpage where the customer can read the privacy policy and can check a box to give the consensus to use their phone number.\n\nUntil the customer not approve the webpage the customer info are stored to platform but is not usable and will be delete after 7 days. Sounds reasonable? Or can the owner not enter customer information until he reads the privacy policy and gives consent?\n\nThanks",

First of all, you are processor for the beauty centers and they are the controller and need to obtain a legal basis for processing the data.\n\nI think you could argue the performance of the contract (between the customer and the beauty center) needs a reminder and thus art. 6(1)(b) GDPR could already be the legal basis. It's not too different from the 'your package has been shipped' emails you get when you order something online.\n\nEven if you argue that the reminder is not strictly necessary to perform the contract, the beauty center will have a legitimate interest to send the reminders, as otherwise customers might not show up. In that case it would be nice to allow them to object to this and give them the option to turn it off (also keeping art. 21 GDPR in mind), and to be honest I would offer that option in all cases.\n\nNote that this whole situation may change as soon as your reminder is more than just a reminder: if it starts to look like a marketing message in any way, or if you start reminding people that it's time to visit the beauty center again, you may have to start taking the e-Privacy directive and other relevant local anti-spam laws into account.\n\nAlso note that this post is not legal advice and that you should consult your own lawyer if you want definitive answers.",

        "author": "latkde",
        "id": "1ifvwyx",
        "selftext": "It’s been wonderful to see the growth of this community over many years, with so many great posts and so many great responses from helpful community members. But with scale also come challenges. The following updates are intended to keep the community helpful and focused:\n\n* Rules have been clarified around recurring issues (appropriate conduct, advertising, AI-generated content).  \n* Post flairs have been updated to align better with actual posts.  \n* Community members are invited to become moderators.\n\n## New rules (effective 2025-02-02)\n\n1. **Be kind and helpful.** Community members are expected to conduct themselves professionally. Discussion should be constructive and guiding. Personal attacks will not be tolerated.  \n2. **Stay on topic.** The r/gdpr subreddit is about European data protection. This includes relevant EU and UK laws (GDPR, ePrivacy, PECR, …) and matters concerning data protection professionals (e.g. certifications). General privacy topics or other laws are out of scope.  \n3. **No legal advice.** Do not offer or solicit legal advice.  \n4. **No self-promotion or spamming.** This subreddit is meant to be a resource for GDPR-related information. It is not meant to be a new avenue for marketing. Do not promote your products or services through posts, comments, or DMs. Do not post market research surveys.  \n5. **Use high-quality sources.** Posts should link to original sources. Avoid low-quality “blogspam”. Avoid social media and video content. Avoid paywalled (or consent-walled) material.  \n6. **Don’t post AI slop.** This is a place for people interested in data protection to have discussions. Contribute based on your expertise as a human. If we wanted to read an AI answer, we could have asked ChatGPT directly. LLM-generated responses on GDPR questions are often “confidently incorrect”, which is worse than being wrong.  \n7. **Other.** These rules are not exhaustive. Comply with the spirit of the rules, don't lawyer around them. Be a good Redditor, don't act in a manner that most people would perceive as unreasonable.\n\nYou can find background and detailed explanations of these rules in our wiki:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules/)  \n* [https://old.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules)\n\nPlease provide feedback on these rules.\n\n* Should some of these rules be relaxed?  \n* Is something missing? Did you recently experience problems on r/gdpr that wouldn’t be prohibited by these rules?  \n* What are your opinions on whether the UK Data Protection Act 2018 should be in scope?\n\n## Post flairs\n\nThere used to be post flairs “Question \\- Data Subject” and “Question \\- Data Controller”. These were rarely used in a helpful manner.\n\nIn their place, you can now use post flairs to indicate the relevant country.\n\nWith that change, the current set of post flairs is:\n\n* **EU 🇪🇺:** for questions and discussions relating primarily to the EU GDPR  \n* **UK 🇬🇧:** for questions and discussions that are UK-specific  \n* **News:** posts about recent developments in the GDPR space, e.g. recent court cases  \n* **Resource**  \n* **Analysis**  \n* **Meta:** for posts about the r/gdpr subreddit, such as this announcement\n\nThis update is only about post flairs. User flairs are planned for some future time.\n\n## Call for moderators\n\nTo help with the growing community, I’d ask for two or three community members to step up as moderators. Moderating r/gdpr is very low-effort most of the time, but there is the occasional post that attracts a wider audience, and I’m not always able to stay on top of the modqueue in a timely manner.\n\nRequirements for new moderators:\n\n* You find a large reserve of kindness and empathy within you.  \n* You have at least basic knowledge of the GDPR.  \n* You intend to participate in r/gdpr as normal and continue to set a good example.  \n* You can spare about 15 minutes per week, ideally from a desktop computer.  \n* You can comply with the [Reddit Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct), which has become a lot more stringent in the wake of the 2023 API protests.\n\nIf you’d like to serve as a ~~community janitor~~ moderator, please send a modmail with subject “moderator application from \\<your\\_username\\>”. I’ll probably already know your name from previous interactions on this subreddit, so not much introduction needed beyond your confirmation that you meet these requirements.\n\n**Edit:** Applications will stay open until at least 2025-02-08 (end of day UTC), so that all potential candidates have time to see this post.\n\n## Call for feedback\n\nPlease feel free to use the comments to discuss the above rule changes, or any other aspect of how r/gdpr is being managed. In particular, I’d like to hear ideas on how we can encourage the posting of more news content, as the subreddit sometimes feels more like a GDPR helpdesk.\n\nPrevious mod post: [r/GDPR will be unavailable starting June 12th due to the Reddit API changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/14763xl/rgdpr_will_be_unavailable_starting_june_12th_due/) \\[2023-06-11\\]",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone! I'm building a SaaS, where I collect user informations like name, email, purchases and more. I do also collect informations on the activity performed with the SaaS. The SaaS goal is to host public websites, and I have a ToS policy in place that specifies that the service is not intended for use cases like:  \n\n* Publishing adult or oscene content\n* Publishing guns related content, violence, harmful messages\n* scams, unauthorized usage of other brands without the appropriate permission, pyramidal schemes\n* etc.\n\nThe list is long, but it's in place to make sure that people understand that they can use the SaaS for:\n\n* Landing pages\n* collect user information through contact forms\n* offering services \n* selling products\n* blogging content\n* general but legitimate usage of a website for a generic use cases of a brand or business intended to provide services\n\nNow, I am the controller for my users data, but I'm also storing users of my users data. It's a multi-tenant platform, so my clients (my users) have their customers (users of my users) that have to be able to log-in, insert order, save content (like preferred articles, wishlist), register and sign up to newsletters, insert shipping informations, process payments, etc.\n\nBasically, we're talking about a very similar product to Shopify, or even Wordpress w/ WooCommerce plugin. The architecture design and technical implementation suggests that the platform is more similar to a very general use case etsy or eBay, or even Amazon. We could say that on my platform, the 'vendor' profile is a website of its own. The customer profile is a just a customer and might exist for a website or more, but without interconnection between the websites.\n\nWell basically my questions are these:\n\n* What should I do, first of all, with my clients data (users registered directly to my platform)? What if they upload content that violates the ToS? \n* What happens if a user wants to delete data that was public? Should I directly delete the data at their wish? Or am I legally able to keep data for a certain period of time, to make sure that in case of legal cases, I'm able to say \"this guy did this and that on my platform, here's the evidence, here's what he uploaded at XYZ in time\". \n* What about content that changed in time? A user creates an illegal websites (how to make drugs at home i.e). After one week he changes it to be a shoes e-commerce. Should I keep copy of different versions of the website during time? What are my actual responsibilities in this case? Am I liable to be the service offer that allowed the customer to upload such content?\n* What about my clients' customers? The clients manage the commerce part by themselves through Stripe, and I'm responsible to keep data like performances of the web store, orders, shipping and so forth. But, this data is now on my systems. Am I a controller for this data too? Should I design the architecture to be customer dependent and offer services explicitly as a processor and provider of services, but delegate data responsibility entirely to my clients? To do this, I guess I should provide them a separated infrastructure that I just 'rent' to them. What if data is on my infrastructure, but I design APIs to allow my clients to edit their 'part of data'?\n\nI know the post is long, and I have MANY MORE questions. One thing sure is I have to get a lawyer ahahah\n\nThanks for the read. Basically, I would like to understand the know-how to be excluded from responsibilities of what my clients post on their website, and be covered in case of illegal activities conducted through my service. \n\nA related scenario is: What prevents Shopify from being guilty of enabling the diffusion of a scam product, or ponzi scheme? What allows social media to be exempt from the guilt of sharing adult content, or violence, or terrorism related content?\n\nI really like this project and in no way I'll ever leave this un-completed. I'm planning to keep it small until it takes off in my local area. I'm not concerned right now of what could happen, since I will meet my clients in person. But I have to be ready to switch to the global scale, where all of a sudden I realized that the true problem is not technical, capital or operational, but it's legal! ",

                "body": "You have asked a lot of questions, most of them not related to GDPR / data protection and more about general hosting provider issues.\n\nFor the GDPR aspect, I think it would be helpful to carefully distinguish where you act as a sole data controller, as a joint controller together with your customers, or as a data processor on behalf of your customers. This makes a tremendous difference with respect to your legal obligations. For example, only data controllers are responsible for handling data subject requests. Data processors have much simpler compliance obligations, but are prohibited from using the data for their own purposes.\n\nMost B2B SaaS will mostly act in a data processor role, though things quickly get complicated when data is shared across customers or if the SaaS provider wants to collect analytics for their own purposes. Here, it doesn't matter what kind of \"architecture\" or \"infrastructure\" you have, but who is *responsible* for the relevant data processing activities.\n\nIn this context, I greatly recommend the in-depth discussion on the concepts of Controller and Processor in the relevant EDPB guidelines (PDF): https://www.edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-072020-concepts-controller-and-processor-gdpr_en",

You will need a authentication process that is suitable for online services. If you can't verify someone you are allowed to refuse.\n\nIt is tricky to remove information because of a data subject request for a large scale platform where the users are difficult to verify however seperately you are allowed to remove personal and non personal data if it violates the TOS so treat the two things seperately.\n\nRegarding the other points around preventing illegal activities, you need to take steps to do so but you're not responsible for preventing any instance of it, you may find that you do not  have the resources to do so.",

I'm setting up everything to make sure I have things in place to run a private admin dashboard that makes me sudo over these guys. I have the feeling that platforms are never safe, but what I'm building is surely a scammer paradise if not regulated and monitored correctly.\n\n>What do you mean do with your clients data?\n\nThis particular question was related to the upcoming question about the violation. I see that ToS can keep me safe and if I do everything that I state in the ToS, I'm not going to have particular problems. As long as what I'm doing is legal.\n\n>Your customers are controllers for their users and you wish to be a processor\n\nYes, I totally agree. I have to figure out if I can get away with just providing the stripe integrations and embed stripe content into my platform. In that case, I should stay as a processor since I just provide a Stripe integration, but I definetely not manage any stripe data.\n\n>That said, if a customer ignores a valid request, that violates (or should) your ToS so you should tell the customer to either properly execute gdpr requests or you will disable the customer's account.\n\nSo, do you mean I should warn the user and say \"if you don't follow procedure, I'll delete your account\"?  \nThe general idea is:   \nYou uploaded bad content. I instantly remove it.  \nNow, either you proceed to a formal request to permanently delete your data, either I will just ban you.\n\n>Not a gdpr question; answer varies by country and by mood of whomever is in power within the country.

Just to clarify context, I mean a situation where: \n\n* User receives a payment via Stripe.\n* I process the order through my back-end and I keep commissions\n* Now he has to prepare the shipping label\n* I offer some sort of service for this, and by doing so, I keep track of the shipping data, order day, product id, customer of my client contacts, and so forth.\n\n  \nThank you very much for this response.

They are not related. Neither removes a subjects ability to request deletion, but LI does not require consent to process whereas consent (unsurprisingly), does.\n\nIf the latter - a photograph taken by you is your copyrighted work of art. It'd be a pretty tyrannical court that decided you didn't have a legitimate interest to publish that art, unless the taking and distribution of the photograph itself was illegal (for example CSAM) or the purpose for which you published the photograph was illegal (harassment).\n\nAre you perhaps getting confused between the difference between consent required prior to processing (if any) and a processor's requirement to honour a subject deletion request?

Using consent as the basis for processing has some very specific requirements you need to comply with. If it’s not necessary I wouldn’t do it. It’s not a “Better safe than sorry” thing.

Websites could still continue to have the bespoke control options but just not in your face. \n\nThis way I could just say “No” to non-essential cookies once via my browser configuration and not have to navigate cumbersome per-site web configuration which often takes longer to do than actually using the site.",

However, browser makers probably don't have any interest in walking into this legal minefield. Miss any part that is necessary for obtaining valid consent? You get sued/fined from the privacy side. Actually ask for valid consent without using dark patterns? You're sued by the ad network and publisher side for anticompetitive practices. This will be horrible for smaller browser vendors, but absolutely interesting in the case of Google Chrome, a browser built by the world's biggest ad network.\n\nEven if browsers start offering the necessary APIs, will websites use them? Some browsers won't have the consent APIs ready, so websites will still need a fallback. And if you're already implementing a cookie banner, why not use it *all* the time? Websites might also not trust the browser to actually *ask* the user properly, and might fear that the browser just rejects all consent requests.\n\nThere are a couple of existing legal/technical solutions in this direction:\n\n* The [\"do not track\" header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) is a signal browsers can send to websites. It has three possible values opt-in/opt-out/unknown. In 2012, Microsoft Internet Explorer effectively enabled DNT by default, so that the opt-out signal might not have been a decision by the user. Subsequently, DNT became widely ignored. Some browsers have removed DNT support because it is more useful for fingerprinting than for consent management. DNT also cannot indicate valid consent under the GDPR because it is not specific enough.\n* \"Global Privacy Control\" is a mechanism that's very similar to DNT, but can only be used to convey the user's \"Do Not Sell Or Share Preference\". While it has legal effect under the CCPA (California privacy law), it seems unsuitable for GDPR consent management.\n* The IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) is a technical specification that can describe different standardized purposes, and track what the user has consented to (or objected to, in case of legitimate interests). The TCF is the basis for most consent management tools. Because the TCF was created by a consortium of the ad industry, it has seen wide adoption – but also criticism and lawsuits that caused significant refinements. But the current status quo involves an industry of cookie management solutions that package the TCF into easy to use plugins for websites, and I don't think they'd be particularly happy if their entire business would be taken over by browsers.\n* Specifically for cookie consent in Germany, § 26 TTDSG explicitly paves a path towards centralized consent management. But I don't expect it to see wide adoption, due to the fairly strict criteria needed for such a centralized system, and because any centralized solution will likely result in less consent – going against the interests of the ad industry and websites.\n\nPersonally, I'm fairly happy that the EU has not legislated a specific technical approach that everyone must use, and instead only provided conditions that valid consent must fulfil. It could be much, much worse. But for the time being, this means we're locked into a world where every website has its own slightly different consent banner.\n\nFor technical people on desktop systems, I recommend using a tracking blocker like uBlock Origin and subscribing to filter lists that remove \"annoyances\", for example the \"AdGuard Annoyances\" lists. This hides many cookie banners, but sometimes breaks some sites.",

It’s a good rule in principle - you should be in control of what information is put onto or taken off your device - but it’s out of date and ultimately a blunt tool for a more nuanced issue given the way the internet works. The connection to GDPR is that it takes its definition of consent from GDPR, which is now stricter (or more accurately, clearer) than the previous data protection directive.\n\nA new ePrivacy Directive was supposed to come in alongside GDPR, with a more modern approach to cookies, but the EU hasn’t been able to agree it so we currently have this slight fudge of the GDPR alongside the older ePrivacy directive that’s lead to the situation we have now.\n\nIn answer to your question of whether browser based consent has been considered, the answer is yes, sort of, in the UK at least - the previous government had already started to try and make changes to the cookie rules with this being one of the ultimate aims (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/data-a-new-direction) but the legislation didn’t get through before the recent election so it remains to be seen what the new government’s plans are.\n\nIn the meantime the UK ICO has made it clear that for a cookie banner to be compliant, if there is an “Accept All” button then there also has to be a “Reject All” button in the same layer (i.e. it must be as easy to reject all cookies as to accept them all) which is something at least.",

If that is the case, the DPO will have some form of justification for allowing it to happen - same for the CISO or head of security. \n\nThe problem you're going to run into here (and obviously it is up to you) is that you could well kick off a massive issue for senior leadership. If they've procured a piece of software that has fundamental privacy or security issues, they are going to be in the firing line. If in the worst case scenario they have to pull the HR system, procure a new one and pay both contracts, someone is getting fired. This will also mean you're going to end up in a difficult set of conversations, probably starting with your manager. \n\nI don't say this to dissuade you, but I would say I'd have a think about the potential pushback - is the displaying of your birth date and month that big an issue for you?",

This medical software company appears to be a third-party, although I'm not sure if something like my non-citizen status or the clinic's existing agreement with me would effect the meaning of that.\n\nI also didn't know this change in the clinic's services was made until I requested an appointment by email, and the confirmation arrived in the new form of this company's services.\n\nThe only information I was given about this change prior to its implementation, was a verbal indication during one therapy session immediately prior, that the office's in-house secretary would be handling the scheduling of future appointments. There was no mention of any new medical software company having access to my data.\n\nI was never asked to renew a consent form. I wasn't given any opportunity to opt-out of having personal details like my full name and email shared with this company.\n\nAlthough my name and email address were evidently shared, the clinic has kindly agreed to \"erase\" all my data from the company's software and allow me to opt-out of its services in the future.\n\nQuestions:\n\nWas there a breach of my medical data?\n\nShould the clinic have notified me in writing or obtained my written consent prior to introducing my data to the medical software company's webapp?\n\nIf not, why?",

It listens to the recording and it can tell you who speaks the most, and who said what (in transcript format). I'm no biometrics expert but I assume it would need a sample and a probe in order to do this?\n\nMy initial thought was that this type of voice recognition and attributing it back to a person would be classed as biometrics. Fireflies leave a lot to be desired when it comes to their general data protection/security assurances so I can't actually tell how it works.\n\nThere is a separate headache in that if this is biometrics it engages Art 9, where the only basis applicable would be explicit consent. However, as an employer we'll never rely on employee consent, which would seemingly leave us stranded in terms of lawful basis. This would apply to almost all controllers though who wish to use biometrics with their employees.\n\nAny help and guidance would be appreciated.",

The only information in the email linking it to me my title \"Mr\", my surname and the address of the property in question.\n\nI believe my ex was contacted because we lived together (many years ago) and we used this letting agency to manage the house we rented. After splitting up, she stayed in the rented house and I moved home. I continued to receive emails about the property but phoned up and confirmed that I no longer lived there and that she was the sole renter of the property. The letting agency agreed to remove me from correspondence. Unfortunately I don't have a written email confirmation of this as it was agreed to over the phone. This is the only explanation that I can think of that she was contacted.\n\nI've contacted the branch manager of the property agent to ask why was she contacted and for them to update their database, but I still haven't received as much as even an apology.\n\nIt is not the case, but what if my ex wasn't of sound mind, abusive or a stalker. This business just handed over my potential future address to someone without consent.\n\nEssentially, I would like to know if this breaches GDPR or a privacy policy of some kind so I can make a formal complaint.",

For the past 4 years, I've been working in the IT industry, primarily in data analytics. During this time, I've developed a strong foundation in business intelligence and worked with tools like Power BI and MicroStrategy. I also have intermediate-level skills in SQL.\n\nRecently, my career took an unexpected turn. Over the past three months, I've had the opportunity to dive into the world of data privacy. I've been working extensively with a tool called OneTrust, and I've completed several certifications in this area. Surprisingly, I've developed a newfound interest in data privacy, and I'm thinking of making a career switch.\n\nThe catch is, my experience with data privacy is primarily on the technical side – things like setting up web forms for data subject access requests and managing consent and preferences. While I have some high-level knowledge and have read a few articles on GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD, I'm eager to delve deeper into this field.\n\nSo, I turn to you, fellow Redditors, for guidance:\n\nHow can I successfully transition from data analytics to data privacy?\n\nWhat certifications should I pursue to bolster my knowledge and expertise in data privacy?\n\nMy passion lies in the technical implementation side of data privacy; how can I specialize in this aspect?\n\nI'm excited to hear your insights and experiences. Your advice will be invaluable as I embark on this journey to pivot my career towards data privacy. Thank you in advance!",

Keep the data, but don't use it.\n- Right to data portability: Export your data in some convenient format. Like Google Takeout.\n- Right to object: This seems to be a right to stop further processing?\n- Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing: This only seems to apply when there are legal consequences, or other major consequences. Most hobby sites aren't affected.\n\nSo for a simple app that tries to avoid PII, how many of these could be handled via self-service? Some rights seem easier than others:\n\n- Access, rectification and erasure could mostly be done using the ordinary app UI, as long as all data was visible to the user and editable.\n- Data portability could probably be accomplished via JSON export.\n- \"Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing\" often won't apply to low-stakes hobby sites.\n\nSome others seem a bit more complicated:\n\n- Restricting processing is weird. In some cases, I think you'd need to freeze the account, or make the raw data readable by only the user?\n- Can the right to object be satisfied by some combination of outright deletion and restricting processing?\n\nWhat major concerns am I overlooking here? What portion of total GDPR compliance could be designed into the fundamental structure of a hobby site? Think of this as an exercise in extreme \"privacy by design.\"",

                "body": "It seems you have a good overview and a plan to tackle the main data subject rights. Great! This is, after all, one of the more visible parts of the GDPR.\n\nHowever, GDPR is deeper than providing a data access feature. Before you tackle those, it makes sense to look at [Art 5 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) – the principles from which the rest follows. Every processing of personal data should have a clear purpose and \"legal basis\", and should be limited to what is necessary. The data should be protected with appropriate security measures.\n\nThat legal basis bit is important because it interacts with data subject rights. For example, \"consent\" gives the data subject an unconditional right to revoke consent. A \"legitimate interest\" gives rise to the right to object – but that objection can sometimes be denied. This in turn means that not all deletion requests have to be honored. For example, you wouldn't let a hacker object to logfiles that document their exploit attempts.\n\nSo much here is contextual, I don't think it's possible to be entirely compliant with an automated approach. But it's possible to get pretty far. You can implement an \"export my data\" and \"delete my account\" feature, which gets you mostly there. You can gate some features behind an opt-in for consent, or opt-out/objection for legitimate interests (where appropriate).\n\nYou missed one important data subject right: the right to be informed. The necessary items are listed in Art 13 GDPR. If you receive personal data from third parties, Art 14 is relevant as well. Most privacy notices include the general information from the Art 15 right to access as well.\n\nIt might be worth considering implementing privacy-friendly systems, but without referencing the GDPR. This is because such claims might suggest that you're actively targeting people in the EU/EEA/UK, subverting this line of argument:\n\n> I'm not targetting anyone in Europe. So it's unlikely that the GDPR even applies.",

The flash card data is strictly necessary for the tasks requested by the user, and the data is effectively under their control.\n\n> This in turn means that not all deletion requests have to be honored. For example, you wouldn't let a hacker object to logfiles that document their exploit attempts.\n\nHonestly, a better strategy for log data is probably to throw it all out after 7-15 days anyways. Long-term log data creates other risks. The exception, of course, is to comply with a legal hold, subpoena or warrant. At which case local law is far more relevant than extraterritorial EU laws!\n\n> You missed one important data subject right: the right to be informed. \n\nReading through section 13, I think the most important part in this scenario would be a clear, written policy explaining what data is stored, how it is used, and how to view/edit/export/delete it. The more specific details for GDPR compliance (like various officers and agents) might be less relevant for small sites that do not target EU users, or collect sensitive information about them.",

I'm a bit new to the role and trying to clean up and manage our communications.\n\nOccasionally as in any daycare, there comes a parent with a problem and they decide to send an email. In the past, the volunteer leaders have not been good at using BCC for sending emails to all the parents. So all the parents know each others email address.

I'm not yet aware that everyone on the list consented to sharing their email address and I know there is no opt-in for this. Also... these email threads can get to be too much and inappropriate. Can we require the parents not send these?\n\nAlso, I guess what legal implications can the school face because these email addresses were just simply put in the \"to\" line and not sent via BCC.\n\nThanks in advance for any insight.

I suppose you also need to be aware that the initial email may concern and identify a single child. Regardless of GDPR it is not appropriate to continue these discussions with multiple people on copy.\n\nI think this could be as simple as never 'replying all'; deal with the parent raising the problem directly 1-2-1 and then if any procedural changes need to be notified to all parents using the BCC fields in a separate, new communication.\n\nI'm not sure if this answers your question, but I hope it helps.",

That being the case, you're probably safe from any repercussions for now.\n\nIf parents choose to send emails to the school and all other parents, that's their prerogative - there's nothing you can do to stop this now that the damage has been done. You probably shouldn't \"Reply All\" to these emails, particularly if your reply includes personal data about parents or children, but even if it doesn't, it's just going to be a nightmare from a customer service perspective.\n\nYou can probably *ask* parents not to copy everyone into their emails, especially if this always results in a clusterfuck of crossed wires and difficult situations, and you can make it clear that you won't be Replying All any more and if they have any issues they want to raise, they should contact you directly. If at any point you do need to send all parents an email about an issue that has been raised, just send this as a new communication. \n\nThere might be some teething problems with all of the above as some parents are probably happy with the current system (especially if those parents are persistent troublemakers), but if you stick to a suitable process no matter what, they will start to realise this is how it is.\n\nIn future, if parents want to get in touch with other parents, they can get the contact details the same way school parents always have done - by asking them in person.",

Nonetheless, people should be aware that more and more often, the Supervisory Authorities are shooting down the exception in cases that you might think are personal. E.g., recently, the Spanish SA held that a guy that forwarded private photos of another girl through social media exceeded the \"purely personal\" exception because of the aim to \"share with the world\". Everyone should watch out for what they do in this sense, especially with WhatsApp&Facebook groups, websites, etc.\n\nRegarding the responsibility of the daycare for the parents' emails, another two things to take into account:\n\n* The reason why they have each other's emails in the first place is because of a former bad practice of the daycare. This matters.\n* The daycare could be seen as an organiser of the communications/the reason why they are communicating in the first place, so it does have a duty to \"regulate\" or moderate. \n* You are not only allowed to but should remind parents of the duty to protect their and others' intimacy. Of course, I wouldn't be too technical nor refer to the GDPR, but remind them that what is written in an email can be seen by others and that they should direct emails only to the people that need to know about the content (especially when the topic is sensitive), that they should use BCC when appropriate, etc.\n\nCreating a document of good practices and sharing it with them could be a strong argument to protect the daycare if, in the future some parent messes up.",

Think tweets and social media posts *only* if the user has totally public settings. \n\nWhile consent *can be* a hard legal basis to rely on, it’s actually very doable for surveys since you have a chokepoint at the entry.  Get consent at the outset where you have plenty of space to clearly lay out the necessary elements of consent and can record the click of the user’s agreement. You can even take steps to limit the reidentifiability of results if your data systems have a basic level of GDPR compliance built in. For example, you can create a mapping table of user/random identifier, then a secondary table of random identifier/consent-id, and then delete the first table with user information.",

But that is not an impossible standard. For example, you could include a checkbox that subjects can tick to indicate consent, after being suitably informed about what data you're going to collect. Also, make sure to make it very clear that these fields can be left empty, and remind the subjects that the questionnaire can be cancelled at any time.\n\nAs already pointed out, responses in a survey are not “public”, so that exemption cannot apply.

                "body": "Good one. So let me get this straight. Your employer uses a digital platform for time keeping purposes (which should be the employer's legal obligation as to the end). The employer also wants to register the geo-location of the employees and you say it is not clear why the employer does this.\n\nLet me start by saying that consent should be out of the question as a lawful basis b/c free nature of consent is typically flawed in employment relationships - there's DPA practice on this and it is confirmed by courts. So if the employer actually asks you to consent, you should be able to refuse to provide it and it should be fine, i.e., no retaliation against you, no collection of geo-location data (or if collected that data should not be used), etc.\n\nThen, you can find out why the employer uses this data (i.e., the processing purpose) by filing a data access request grounded on art. 15, GDPR (or any equivalent); you should also ask the employer to clarify the lawful basis to this end (although the employer is not mandated under the GDPR to provide this info). You may find out that the employer uses the geo-location data to substantiate Labour Law, HSSE obligations related to remote work (i.e., l.b. = employer's legal obligation) or for security purposes (i.e., l.b. = employer's legitimate interest, possibly in the context of a legal obligation, such as those under the NIS legislation, or as part of a security certification required in the employer's business); other purposes may apply (seen a few in practice), but I'd be very curious to learn about them :). If the lawful basis is the legal obligation, there's not much you can do about it and you face a Sartrian existential dilemma where you must decide between keeping and quitting your job. If it's legitimate interest, you can theoretically object to the processing, but you must raise your own personal reasons for this and anyway the employer may provide you with their overarching reasons to proceed with the processing (art. 21, GDPR).\n\nIf you are not satisfied with your employer's reaction and response, you can always complain to the DPA. You should invoke, for instance, that the processing is unlawful, or excessive, or that it hurts your interests and freedoms, and you should describe why. This is somehow the equivalent of blowing the whistle on your employer, so you could expect retaliation (which should not be legal where you live, but this is the life).\n\nYou probably have other courses of action as well, such as challenging the validity of the legal provision, etc., but these are not so commonly pursued.",

Per Art 88 GDPR, data processing in the context of employment can be governed by more specific national laws or by collective agreements. For example, if your workplace is unionized and the employer negotiated a collective agreement with the council/union, then the agreement could authorize such location tracking.\n\nIf that doesn't apply, we return to the usual GDPR rules: any processing of personal data must have a clear purpose, and must be authorized by a “legal basis”. That basis could be consent, but doesn't have to be. Relevant alternative legal bases:\n\n* knowing your location is necessary for fulfilling the employment contract\n* there is a legal requirement to record your location\n* geolocating you is necessary for a legitimate interest that outweighs your interests and rights\n\nOnly in the case of a legitimate interest would you be able to object to such tracking, but the objection could be overridden if the legitimate interests are compelling enough.\n\nA lot here will depend on context, e.g. whether the employee works in a fixed office, or whether the employee spends most of their time traveling internationally. I could see potential legitimate interests from a tax compliance, insurance, or worker safety angle. The granularity of the location could also matter, e.g. country-level vs GPS location accurate to a few meters.\n\nIn general I agree with you that such location tracking is creepy and probably unnecessary, but there's way too little info to know. I agree with other commenters that a first step to get more info would be a data subject access request (DSAR) to the employer about the exact data collected by the time-stamping platform.\n\n* Per Art 13(1)(c) and (d) you should have already been informed about the purposes of processing, the legal bases, and the legitimate interests (if any).\n* Per Art 15(1)(a) and (b) the response to the DSAR should describe the purposes of processing, and the categories of data being processed.",

This decision is based on the following :\n\n*Under Article 17 of the GDPR individuals have the right to have personal data erased. This is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. The right is not absolute, the right applies if the data is no longer needed for the purpose it was collected or if the basis for collect and processing was the consent of the patient.  Medical data is always needed to satisfy any future issues about health and you are not processing the data with consent you are processing under Article 9(2)(h) for medical purposes and Article 6(1)(e) under a legal obligation to process the data (NHS contract being the legal obligation) as such this right does not apply, and you cannot comply with the request.*\n\nThis is guidance from the ICO:\n\n*When does the right to erasure not apply?*\n\n*The right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for one of the following reasons:*\n\n*•  to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;*\n\n*•  to comply with a legal obligation;*\n\n*• for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority;*\n\n*•  for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research historical research or statistical purposes where erasure is likely to render  impossible or seriously impair the achievement of that processing; or*\n\n*•  for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.*\n\n*The GDPR also specifies two circumstances where the right to erasure will not apply to special category (medical) data:*\n\n*•  if the processing is necessary for public health purposes in the public interest (e.g. protecting against serious cross-border threats to health, or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices);*     \n\n*Or*\n\n*•  if the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine (e.g. where the processing is necessary for the working capacity of an employee; for medical diagnosis; for the provision of health or social care; or for the management of health or social care systems or services). This only applies where the data is being processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to a legal obligation of  professional secrecy (e.g. a health professional).*\n\n*Article 16 of the GDPR states: - The data subject (patient) shall have the right to obtain from the controller (practice)  without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data  concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.*\n\nI will include a statement on your medical record to state that you have requested your medical record to be removed and include the decision and reasoning behind this.\n\nYou do have the right to contact the ICO.\n\nI am on annual leave until mid August.\n\nYours sincerely",

There will also be national laws setting rules for police work, importantly an EU member state could pass laws that allows this kind of processing. However, police forces don't always stick to technologies that are explicitly allowed.

This includes any data manipulation as well.   \n\n\nIn other words, all the personal information is firewalled within the customer's company account and not available outside its boundaries.   \n\n\nSo, do we in our privacy policy state that we collect \"all\" the information of an employee or just that which is required to allow sign up/login?  \n\n\nThanks again.

Note that, as a processor, you cannot share or delete employee information in response to employee requests; you need to give your customers tools to do so and direct anyone who requests to exercise their GDPR rights as to customer information to a designated point of contact at the customer.  ie direct them to the controller / your customer.\n\nYour DPA is actually straightforward to write, given you have no plans to share this information ever.

Be prepared for retention periods to be complex for larger customers, as they intersect with multiple nationalities' employment laws.  You may be well advised to make your customers choose retention periods (possibly with your guidance, but make customers formally control them) so as to remove some liability for getting them wrong.\n\nBy the by, if you're going to do enterprise, you shouldn't do email signups at all -- require saml.

E.g. you don't have to deal with data subject rights *at all*. Instead, you need a thorough data processing agreement (DPA) per Art 28 GDPR, as explained in [xasdfxx\n's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/sk2du8/comment/hvis6t2/?context=3). A notable restriction is that your clients (the actual data controllers) must sign off on all your sub-processors.\n\n> GDPR requires us to store that information on servers in the EU\n\nNot at all. However, if you process (not just store) the data outside of the EU/EEA (or UK, for UK-based controllers), then you have to consider Chapter V of the GDPR which discusses rules on international transfers. This is extra bureaucracy, so you'd probably want to avoid it. The good news is that the EU (and UK) have recognized a number of other countries as offering an “adequate” level of data protection, which allows you to process data there without extra compliance busywork – your DPAs would just need one extra paragraph. For example, you can outsource tasks to Canadian companies under mostly the same rules as for EU vendors. Exporting data to the US is probably illegal, though. As you are a data processor, you might want to avoid contentious data exports anyway as this might scare away potential clients (especially for clients like German SMEs that often care much more about data residency than the GDPR itself).",

Sounds like a lot is missing from their letter and/or privacy policy.\n\nMarket research companies carrying out questionnaires for other companies can either do so as a data processor on behalf of that company, or a joint data controller. If Kantar are determining sample sizes, interview methods, how results are presented and are generally deciding for themselves how the survey is conducted, then they would be a joint data controller with HMRC - this may explain why HMRC have shared Kantar’s privacy policy with you - as if both are data controllers then both would need to have a privacy policy in place. HMRC should definitely have made it clear whether Kantar are acting as a DP or joint DC for this processing - and sounds like they haven’t set this out anywhere for you?\n\nIn terms of the lawful basis. It seems to me that for the sharing of contact details with Kantar the basis will be legitimate interests (although potentially it could also fall under public interests - again, HMRC should make this clear to you somewhere - and I can’t see this detail in their privacy policy). \n\nFor the actual survey itself it sounds like consent is used. So Kantar are given your contact details from HMRC and then will ask for your consent before they take any further info from you to complete the survey. This consent would obviously need to be specific and informed - making it crystal clear to participants how their data would be used. \n\nInterestingly I found that the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport use Kantar and provide a clear privacy notice to data subjects setting out exactly how it works (and in this case Kantar is a data processor acting on their behalf \n). I’m taking it that you didn’t receive a link to one of these from HMRC?\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/participation-survey-privacy-notice#who-is-the-data-controller",

Another idea I had was a mandatory questionnaire for people from Europe upon accessing my platform.\n\nIt would consist of about 50-60 drop-down style questions about their ad preferences. In case a user would not want to share certain details (gender for example) I would offer an alternative question to determine the correct ads to serve.\n\nUsers could save their settings either by creating an account or storing it in a cookie, however if they don't want to store their preferences the platform would have ask them every time.\n\nI understand this is a tedious effort on the users side providing answers to give or take 50-60 questions but I'd be okay if some users left because of it. There would be no \"I don't want to answer anything\" button and this would apply to ALL users. Tracking cookies will not be implemented at all, neither before nor after the questions. Tracking won't be part of the platform for European users and all user information has to be entered manually. All drop downs would offer a \"Prefer not to say\" option but it would not be set as the default, no option would be set as a default actually.\n\nIrrespective or user experience I just want to understand if this approach would be GDPR compliant?\n\nThanks",

That leaves consent.\n\nBut consent must be freely given. Here, you're asking the user to either consent to tracking or to collection of personal data through the questionnaire. My issues:\n\n* This is not voluntary. There is no option without consent.\n* The substantial effort for answering 50 questions might be considered a detriment if the data subject doesn't consent to tracking. The user must not suffer detriment for withdrawing consent (or, by extension, for never giving consent in the first place).\n* Making access to a service conditional on unrelated consent is usually not OK (compare Art 7(4) GDPR). Neither the tracking nor the ad preference questionnaire is related to the service of your platform.\n\nIf you only expect few users from EU/EEA/UK, the simplest alternative would be to go without personalized ads for them entirely.\n\nThe point of offering a choice between consent to personalized ads and a reasonably priced subscription is that the access to the service is not conditional on consent, and since the subscription is reasonably priced there would be no (substantial) detriment for the user.",

Recent rulings for Cookie permissions showed that it was very difficult for visitors to opt-out out of all tracking and that it needs to be provided as a single click; your implementation falls within the same spirit although you are making it difficult for anyone to opt-in or opt-out.  For usability (and keeping in the spirt of regulator decisions), I would recommend that you have options to say \"Opt-in\" for everything, \"Opt-out\" of everything, and the option for people to pick and choose what ads they wish to see.\n\nYou would also need to take into consideration people who did opt-in and now wish to change  their preferences or opt-out altogether.",

This includes usage statistics from the E corp app. You do have the right to reject this profiling. If you do not wish to be profiled,you should contact us.\"*\n\nThe last part here is what really jumps out to me.

Where a consumer is using the service the provider will be a controller.

        "selftext": "So, our partner (data controller) allocates financing plans for its customer purchases and to this effect collects massive amounts of personal information, such as scans of ids, financial statements...\n\nSo far, to approve a financing plan, the company must check all documents for authenticity, prior to determining eligibility and ultimately approving the plan. The first phase (forgery detection) is done mostly manually/visually, with a few rule-based prior checks.\n\nAs a research lab, we want to collaborate with our partner to see if we could use more advanced techniques such as neural networks to automate fraud detection, or at the very least streamline the manual part. This is just a study, at the present stage, we do not envision actually deploying our solution, even though we very much hope to be successful.\n\nTo perform this study, this means we have to train our algorithms on their highly sensitive database of prior customer data. We will need to iterate on the testing, isolate the hard cases and most likely manually inspect them to figure what makes our algorithms fail or succeed.\n\nMy question is: what legal basis for processing should we use to handle this personal data? To me, it seems the legitimate interest of both our partner and the data subjects that we attempt to reduce fraud. But our perspective so far is not to concretely deliver a solution, just attempt to deliver one. We could also consider the public interest legal basis, but that seems far fetched. \n\nIn any case, we would have to rely on a legal basis that does not require the data subject's consent, because we can not envision retroactively contacting all our data subjects to ask for their consent. And even if we managed to obtain consent for some of them, this would introduce a lot of bias in our training data set, as the customers who cheat would obviously deny consent.\n\nadditional question: in this matter, are we becoming a secondary controller, or would we still stay a data processor?",

The government requires a donor's name and address to make sure they're a taxpayer.\n\nWhen Facebook reports to us the donations they've taken on our behalf, some of the donors have requested that Gift Aid be claimed on their donation. Facebook gives us the names and addresses provided by these donors, which we send to the government. Facebook is fairly unique among online platforms; other platforms claim the Gift Aid for us and then hand that amount over rather than giving us the data.\n\nMy understanding is, we can use this data for the purposes of claiming Gift Aid, because:\n\n* Claiming Gift Aid is a legitimate thing we want to do\n* We need names and addresses to do that\n* The data subject's rights are respected, they have a reasonable expectation that Someone will use their data to assess the Gift Aid claim\n\nWe can't then use data from this source to send direct mail to peoples' houses, because the data subject wouldn't reasonably expect us to use their data for marketing.\n\nBut we would like to send them a \"Thank you for donating\" letter, and ask for consent to continue to post them stuff, including marketing.\n\nI'm less sure about this.\n\n* Thanking donors is a legitimate thing we want to do, as is asking for consent to send letters\n* We need names and addresses to do that\n* The data subject Might reasonably expect to be thanked for a donation, and asking for consent to send marketing doesn't itself count as marketing, it's operational\n\nObviously we're going to err on the side of caution, I'm not going to take Reddit's word for it that this is fine, but if it's open-and-shut inappropriate then that saves me looking further into it.\n\nThanks a lot!",

Encryption at rest is more difficult. E.g. full disk encryption and encryption of backups is a very good idea. But row-level encryption only makes sense in a specific security architecture. Importantly, it now becomes important how the keys are managed. For most SaaS, storing encrypted data in the database is pointless.\n\nWhen selecting appropriate safety measures for GDPR compliance, it is best to start with a risk assessment and derive appropriate measures from that. Don't start with a solution before you have a problem.\n\nAs ScreamOfVengeance points out correctly, the legal basis for processing (e.g. consent) is independent from the appropriateness of safety measures. You can't relieve yourself from GDPR obligations by forcing end users to consent to shitty security.\n\nI'm also wondering whether selecting any legal basis such as consent would be appropriate. If you're processing data on behalf of your customers, you should investigate whether you should act as a Data Processor per GDPR Art 28 for them.

Hundreds of tags. Lots of custom JS in custom HTML tags to derive business critical data from a data structure that no longer exists, but that data had to be found.\n\nA *big job* for sure.\n\nMany surprise revelations throughout, not least was \"we're ditching our consent management platform. We've got a free one, now\".\n\nThe free one did not interact with the data layer other than to simply set some values indicating consent status. No actual data layer event.\n\nQuick rush to send their devs a spec for how to properly interact with the data layer as well as setting a status cookie, which we can use to determine \"fire / don't fire\" tags when consent is decided.\n\nImplementation goes ahead. Consent status appears in the relevant cookie. Tags can respond to consent and we can pick up when users hit that all important \"allow all\" or \"deny all\" and act appropriately.\n\nExcept the Conversion Linker tag, which is *extremely* important to record new user visits when that user has clicked a paid link on a Google results page, is not firing in all cases.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the consent status cookie isn't getting set until some unspecified, but definitely too late, period of time *after* the \"consent update\" event fires. Conversion Linker thinks there's no consent, so it sits on its thumbs and the gclid URL parameter disappears into the abyss.\n\nThis has been live and untouched for weeks, but Black Friday of course reveals an unexpected disparity in conversions attributed to Google Ads. It took quite a while to realise and then understand the why and how of the cause.\n\nThe fix? Easy... consent status was also being set in the data layer. One, small update to the trigger to refer to the data layer instead of the cookie and everything is correct.\n\nLesson learned.",

Two that come to mind are Call Tracking Metrics and WhatConverts. I've used both and can endorse both services. They've been solid and aren't too pricey.

I followed their instructions to create a container for my woocommerce e-commerce events (purchase, add to card, and so on). I also have google site kit plugin installed. \n\nThis part of the job worked properly and I can see every purchase and their value inside my google analytics website. It is also recording when a purchase comes from paid shopping or ads. \n\nThen  I connected Google Ads to my Google Analytics Tag and imported all the conversions and enhanced conversions and I can see purchase, add to cart events and  more that I created. BUT I'm missing something because Google Ads doesn't record any purchase, while Analytics does. \n\nI am missing something? I see Google Ads has a tag itself too. However I can't understand why Google lets me import Analytics events and enhanced conversions in Ads and then doesn't align the records between the platforms. I also tried waiting 24 hours after a purchase has been made and recorded, but nothing. \n\nAlso, I see and there's also an option to blend Analytics and Ads tags and it is making me more confused about how the right way to proceed. \n\nNow I'm thinking about removing all the GA4 enhanced conversion from Google Ads and setting up Ads tag in tag manager to work on its own. Can this be the right way to work?",

Has anyone here tried their courses? I’m interested to know:\n\n\t1. How effective are they in terms of real-world application?\n\t2.

Be very careful with this.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, the point of GTM SST is to make it easy to (1) set up first party tracking and (2) offload the client side from JavaScript and outgoing network requests. Sure, the GTM container is fetched from Google and your tracking call eventually end up at Googles servers but they are routed through your own first party domain. If you have set everything up properly, the user will never see an outgoing network call to Google, they will see a call to your domain.\n\n\nOnce the call ends up in your server side container you can forward all the necessary information to other vendors, i.e. Facebook for example. But you still need the users consent to do this legally.\n\n\nAs for why you should use a client side container in combination with SST, it's just to make it easier for you to set everything up. Nothing is stopping you from making a manual request to your own server but GTM just makes it so much easier with all the existing templates that exist for GA. Also, you might want to run other tags in that container that might not yet be supported in SST without creating a custom client and tag template.",

        "selftext": "Hi!   \n\n\nDoes anyone have working implementation of SGTM being triggered by external GA4 MP calls (not web) for purchases for Google Ads?  \n\n\nWe have a SGTM setup running with:  \n\\- visitor traffic through web gtm --> sgtm --> ga4 + fb + gads  \n\\- marketing id's like gclid, fbc, fbp, client\\_id are captured on the webcalls and stored in Firestore  \n\\- purchases are being called a-sync from a script calling the SGTM GA4 Measurement Protcol Client.  \n\\- each marketing tag retrieves the required marketing id's from firestore upon a tag firing for 'purchase' events.  \n\n\nThis is working as expected for GA4 and Facebook, but I am running into problems with Google Ads.  \n\\- GADS is not registering conversions on the pixel  \n\\- GA4 import into GADS is giving 0 purchase, but I do have attributed conversions in GA4\n\nIt all points to missing GCLID - but...  \n1) **How do I pass the gclid in a MP GA4 call to the SGTM container so that  the GA4 and GADS tag will pick them up natively?**   \n\n\n\\- I cannot enrich the call u\\[pon firing the GADS server tag for conversions does not have custom field to append data to the outgoing call, it seems to consult the first party fpgclaw by itself.   \n\n\n\\- I considered adding it to the original MP call to SGTM in the event as a gclid parameter like I used to do for UA:  \n[https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#gclid](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#gclid)\n\nBut I cannot find any reference in the MP for GA4:  \n[https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client\\_type=firebase#payload\\_query\\_parameters](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=firebase#payload_query_parameters)  \n\n\n**2) When looking at the outgoing calls of the server side GADS tag it seems it still requires the BROWSER for a callback to the marketing platforms instead of taking a direct server to server / api route. Can I even use the GADS server tag in combination with making MP GA4 calls ?**\n\n  \nWhen reading [https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-ads-server-side-tagging-google-tag-manager/](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-ads-server-side-tagging-google-tag-manager/) he stopped at the webcall - maybe  u/sahava has since then ran into the MP conundrum also?  \n\n\nReading that blog I am considering tagging on the gclid ON the page\\_url in the initial MP call so it looks like it is part of the url structure upon the request coming into SGTM hence bypassing the need for a cookie.",

        "selftext": "Hi all. Prepare for a sort of lengthy post!\n\nHad an email from Netcraft on the 22nd April around 6PM, saying my site was phishing and pretending to be a MS site. I checked with the hosting company and they said this email was legit. I found the offending folders and removed them. Changed passwords on literally everything regarding the website/hosting/cpanel/FTP etc. (I have since removed the FTP Accounts)\n\nNext day, 23/04, Google is now flagging my domain as deceptive (I'm assuming Netcraft will have probably alerted Google?). Console showed that it was down to that folder and a few other files on the domain which were legitimate WordPress plugin files and i believe they haven't been modified (WordFence also agreed)\n\n**Hosting Setup**\n\nIn my hosting a i have the primary domain (Which is the domain with the issue) and an addon domain. I also have a sub domain with two development websites on, which sits on the affected domain.\n\n**The primary domain** \\- This should in theory be fine, everything was updated two days before this happened, that includes WP, WP Themes and plugins.\n\n**The addon domain** \\- is probably how it got in. It's a theme that seems to have stopped being properly maintained (was running a version from Nov 2016) and contained a few plugins that have been abandoned, one no longer existed on the WP repo either.\n\nI had a backup of one of the development sites from middle of March which I've installed on another domain I have with a different hosting company (Updated everything on this and changed passwords too).The other development site, I didn't have a backup that far back, as it's a fairly new-ish site. (I've recreated this website on the other domain so these where completely free from the problematic domain.)\n\n**What i did next**\n\nI decided to basically nuke the WP Installs via Cpanel for the primary domain and the addon domain, cleaned everything out of the root folders and deleted all db's and db users.\n\nI then installed a new WP on both of these domains.\n\n**Addon Domain** \\- I rebuilt the site using a newer theme (Salient) and this now has next to no plugins installed, these are all current plugins that are maintained still.\n\n**Primary Domain** \\- Installed one plugin 'CMP – Coming Soon & Maintenance Plugin' along with an addon for this plugin (It's a styled/custom theme for the coming soon page)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Google Review Request**\n\nI submitted a review request with Google Yesterday after i had done all this.\n\nThis morning (24/04), i logged into search console and it's still flagged. The sample URL's that where in the list yesterday have now gone, however the list now shows two sample urls from the addon plugin for the coming soon page?\n\n' wp-content/plugins/cmp-premium-themes/orbit/js/anime.min.js '' /wp-content/plugins/cmp-premium-themes/orbit/js/demo4.js '\n\nNo idea as to why they've been flagged?\n\n**What i've done this morning**I've once again wiped the WordPress install on the affected domain, re-installed Wordpress via CPanel and just left it like that.\n\nThere are no active plugins on the site now. The plugin list is empty. It's as stripped back as it can be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Google Review Request - Again**  \nI've submitted another review request this morning in hope this will lift the 'Dangerous/Deceptive site' element.\n\n**Report Incorrect Phishing Warning** \\- I've also filled this out today too, basically explaining that i now believe that the warning is incorrect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Site was hacked. Cleaned the server. Reinstalled WP with one plugin. Google now flagging the addon/theme of this plugin? Wiped again and resubmitted",

        "selftext": "A few days ago, I posted my idea about \"Web 4\", four modular ideas that help us create democracy on top of blockchain tech. \n\nI got some stark and quality feedback that helped open my eyes to the shortcomings of my ideas and communication. I have re-written most of the paper, and would like to ask again for your feedback. \n\nWhat I Learned before \nTime Tokens, what I thought was the most important part, was looked over -> I clarified (lengthened) this idea and the importance\n\nBiometrics -> Although this was a \"thought experiment\" to me, people took it seriously and reminded me of the problems of biometrics, so I shortened the section, added the \"Biokey/Biosecret\" terminology along with many disclaimers.\n\nCommunication -> I added a \"problem/solution\" section at the beginning, and cut out most of the fluff \n\n# Here's the paper as it is now\n\n# The Web 4 Manifesto: Awakening the Democratic Web \n\nby Douglas James Butner \ndouglas@cxc.world\n\n\n\n# What is Web 4?\n\nWeb 4 is a set of four **modular paradigms** (time tokens, biokeys, information entropy, and geo-social systems) that allow integration of **provable democracy in any social system** that seeks to be more collaborative (organization, government, community, etc.). Modularity allows any project to adopt one or more of these principles to **increase the accuracy, fairness, and transparency** of each individual's role in **collaboration**. \n\nWeb 4 is **built on top of web 3** (it's blockchain-based) while being **fundamentally different** and providing enough **benefit to society** warrant the new title of web 4. \n\nIn essence, web 4 is **collaboration consensus tool** that helps to manifest a shared desire, opinion, or solution by providing a fair system of accounting using time-limited votes, real people, and existing geopolitical stratification.\n\n> Web 4 combines real-world components like time and geography with existing blockchain technology.\n\nIn this manifesto, I will define each of the **components** of web 4, provide **psudeocode** to illustrate the minimum integration into web 2/3, introduce the **benefits to society**, and offer a **roadmap** to adopting these concepts.\n\n# The Problem\nDemocracy, society's biggest and most successful consensus and collaboration mechanism, has become **too slow to keep up** with the modern world. Groups of people organizing, whether to turn a profit as a company, or to live together in a city, are often **under-, mis-, or not represented at all** in the decision making processes that affect their lives and work. In both governments and companies it is the few that make the decisions for the many, even with the **illusion** of \"having a say\" that exists in a **representative system**. \n\n# The Solution\nBy providing each individual with **equal power** in a **transparent decision making process**, the true intent of the majority can not only be known, it can be acted upon in predetermined ways through smart contracts. Though this solution seems simple, there are issues that will need to be addressed according to the needs of each group of collaborating people, such as ensuring **one person per account**, and **limiting the minting of voting tokens with time**, as well as protecting the **privacy of decision makers** where appropriate. This paper will detail these solutions, and recommend that each system decide what components of web 4 to use or not use. For example, systems can (and should) be built using time tokens that **do not use biometric data at all**, a common concern in our modern world. \n\n\n# Background\n\nBefore we detail web 4, we must look briefly at the concepts of web 1, web 2, and web 3. \n\n - **Web 1**\n**Static web**. Files are served from a remote server to a user's browser.\n\n - **Web 2**\n**Dynamic web**. Web pages take a user's information and desires into account to build a unique experience for them. Asynchronous requests allow single page applications to thrive. Applications are still served from a central server.\n\n - **Web 3**\n**Decentralized web**. Applications, often open-source, exist in distributed networks instead of a central server. This unfederated model trades control and censorship ability for freedom and autonomy. \n\n - **Web 4**\n**Democratic web**. Time-limited tokens are given to each individual, and used as a measure of opinion or desire in collaborative systems.\n\nToday, the top 100 websites/apps by traffic are [all](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) web 2-based. The web 2 paradigm fits closely with the wider environment of **corporate-owned information.** \n\nAs more and more individuals and societies are reconsidering the place of **government, censorship, centralization and federated power**, web 3 has emerged as a powerful, provable option to shape the evolution of information and society on planet Earth. \n\nA growing portion of web 2 websites and applications today have elements of web 3, like [cryptoblogs](https://peakd.com) and [games](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings/category/games). While web 2 and web 3 can operate independently, web 3 enhances the abilities of web 2. Similarly, web 3 and web 4 can operate independently, but it makes the most sense for web 4 to be built on blockchains to gain the benefits of reliability and transparency. \n\n## Guiding Philosophy\nWeb 4 seeks to implement [biomimetic](https://biomimicry.org/what-is-biomimicry/) systems in **harmony with the universe itself** by replicating nature: the **abundance** of the Sun, rising **entropy**, and the **equality** of each human being. \n\nWeb 4 tests the hypothesis that when we create information systems in **harmonic resonance** with natural systems, our society will be able to advance more rapidly than ever before, as we will be able to **synchronize energetically** with the larger systems of bioelectromagnetic information processing around us (the Earth, Sun, and Galactic core). \n\n\n## Defining Web 4\nWeb 4 introduces **four modular components** for **provably democratic systems**, suggested to be built on top of web 3's open-source decentralized networks. \n\n### There are four conceptual underpinnings (modules) of web 4\n\n 1. **Time Tokens** \n\t Individuals may claim time-limited tokens at given intervals, which represent that interval.

This paper invites you to involve any of these ideas into your current and future projects. We will discuss these concepts one at a time, but first let's examine why we need them in the first place. \n\n\n# Why we must grow from web 3 to evolve democracy\n> Provable democracy cannot be fully achieved in web 3 as-is because there is no inherit limit over how many accounts a user may control.\n\n**Democracy** is essentially reaching a consensus with the idea that **each person is equal** in their influence on that consensus within defined bounds.\n\nMany different **consensus models** have been developed in web 3, most notably, [proof of work](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work) (**POW**), [proof of stake](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake) (**POS**), and [delegated proof of stake ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/delegated-proof-of-stake-explained)(**DPOS**). These paradigms of consensus are used primarily to determine which chain of transaction records (blocks) is considered valid, \"securing\" a blockchain. \n\nPOS and DPOS are additionally used in projects like [**Hive**](https://peakd.com) to allow users to \"vote\" on valuable content, an early example of the democratic web. DPOS is also used for networks to determine who can access network resources, such as in [EOSIO blockchains](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md).\n\nHowever, both of these POS/DPOS use cases (curation and resource allocation) are not democratic in the sense that **each account is not equal**. In both cases, the root of democracy is in the token, not the individual, and the ownership of tokens determines the voting power or computing power held by an individual. \n\nIn the end, the only way to implement true democracy in any system is through giving **each individual equal power**. The only way to do this while keeping web 3's decentralized nature is to implement the technological and idealogical advancements needed for a **one individual,  one account** system. These advancements  are, for simplicity and communication, called web 4. \n\nLet's review the concepts one by one.\n\n___\n# **1**\n\n___\n\n# Time-issued cryptocurrency (Time Tokens) \n\nTime tokens may be offered or directly distributed to users' wallets periodically. They work by hashing a unique personal identifier (address) with a time identifier, **linking each token to a person and a span of time**.\n\n\n## The Gears of Time Tokens\n\nTime tokens rely on the following concepts:\n 1. **Time Tokens** \n\t Individuals may claim time-limited tokens at given intervals, which represent that interval. Only **one time token can represent the one interval and individual**, and one individual can't hold another's time tokens.\n\t These tokens provide the user with a function or action. The action burns the token, which may cause some change in the state of a system, such as minting another token, registering a vote, or any other action. Thus, **each time token is unique yet semi-fungible**. Time tokens can also be checked for freshness when needed, for example a user may have to use a certain time period's token to cast a vote in an election, which SHOULD also exclude that particular time token from all other functions. \n\t \n 2. **Time Unit**\nA time unit is an time interval that is a sub- or superset of a timestamp. This means that a time unit is some amount (or fraction) of seconds. Each time token MUST be the only one in existence stamped with a particular time unit for each user (wallet). \n\n 2. **Time Faucet**\nA time faucet is a smart contract that offers any qualified account EXACTLY one time token per unit of time passed since their last faucet. This can be an active faucet; requiring some action by the recipient, or a passive faucet; automatically sending the cryptocurrency to the user. \n\n 3. **Qualified Accounts**\nQualified accounts adhere to the individuality requirements of a given system. Each web 4 system will do this differently according to their needs, perhaps with a whitelist, social verification, biometric verification, proof of liveness, or other means. \n\n\n## How do Time Tokens work?\nTime tokens operate like non-fungible tokens in their structure, storing a time unit (integer) with a unique user identifier (string) as the payload data. \n\nThe user's identifier may also be a biocryptographic key (biokey) discussed in the next section.\n\nTime tokens are platform independent, and need only the ability to store simple data: a time unit and user identifier. \n\nIn practice, a time unit is an integer that counts up the number of pre-defined time spans that have passed since an **epoch**. The epoch is typically when the system went live, and represents 0 in the first time interval. \n\n## Time Tokens in practice\n\nIf we were to create a time token for a US citizen to vote in the **US presidential election**, the time span would be 126144000 seconds (four years), and the epoch would be at a timestamp representing the start of the **election day previous to the first election** to use time tokens. On election day, an active faucet would send one time token to each registered voter (aka Qualified Account) with a payload of the user's **unique identifier and the integer 1 as the time unit** (the next election would be 2, and so on.) The user would then send the token to the election's smart contract address with a **memo of their vote**. The system would check the identity of the voter, validity of the memo, and the time unit against their list to ensure they are voting in the correct election, **burn the token** (or else reverse the transaction if malformed), and send the user back another token representing a **\"I Voted\" sticker**. \n\n> This example intentionally doesn't account for anonymity\n\n**This example is trivial.** It becomes beneficial when we realize that we can just as easily send the person 12 voting tokens so they can vote on their first, second and third choice. It becomes even more interesting when we send tokens **every month** (or so) and allow the people to **vote directly on the bills that are being presented to their respective legislative bodies**. It becomes even more expansive when we have the faucet smart contract require **educational actions**, such as opening a link to information on these bills (summary and the full text) **to receive their time tokens**. \n\n## A Simple Example in web 2\n\nHere is the minimum information stored in a time token, using [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction/) as an example\n```\n{\n  \"header\": {\n    \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n    \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n  },\n  \"payoadData\": {\n    \"time-unit\": 294957,\n    \"userid\": \"7f3e873a2c3d\"\n  }\n}\n```\nBelow is a brief pseudocode example of how one could use a signed time token as a JWT.\n\nSee Appendix A for more detailed pseudocode of a time token. \n```\nconst passedBioData = {..} // biodata from user\n\nconst header = {\n        \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n        \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n      }\n\nconst payloadData = {\n\t\"time-unit\": \"294957\", \n\t\"userid\": \"7f3e873a2c3d\", \n\t\"appData\": {\n\t\t\"gold\": 479,\n\t\t\"honey\": 23,\n\t\t\"axe\": 0 \n\t}\n}\n\nconst bioKey = bioKeyGenerator(passedBioData); // Biometric provider's key or one generated direcly by user\n\n// --- Here we have the signature, to be used for any purpose --- \\\\\nsignature = HMACSHA256(\n\tbase64UrlEncode(header) + \".\"+\n\tbase64UrlEncode(payloadData), \n\tbioKey\n)\n\n\nfunction bioKeyGenerator(bioData){\n\t// Function takes data in the form of user input into their browser or smartphone.\n\t// Data is normalized (explained in Appendix A, not shown here)\n\tbioKeyChecked = bioData;\n\t// Return biokey \n\treturn sha256(bioKeyChecked)\n}\n\n\n```\nThe notable parts here are the `time-unit` and `userid` in the payload, and the `bioKey` which is generated by a user's biometric data.\n\nWe have said we web 4 is based on web 3 (blockchain), but this example intentionally used  **web 2 technology**. Much of the rest of this paper goes over ways to avoid trust by incorporating biometric data in a specific way, but that's not always needed, or helpful. We have to trust a government to run our elections. We have to trust social media platforms with our photos. We have to trust the Sun will rise, and a. giant meteor won't crash into Earth. \n\nThe truth is, **all systems have some level of trust**, even if that's just in the system itself. If we try to get rid of this trust by implementing a system so good we are our own private key, it can backfire, and when it does, if we built it because we were fearful instead of trusting, that's super lame. \n\nWhile I'm going to lay out a possible solution to use biometrics in a \"trustless\" way that fits with web 3 ideals, I don't personally think it's a good idea, and I won't be designing my Web 4 apps with it for quite some times, if ever. \n\n___\n# **2**\n\n___\n\n# **Proof of Individuality - Biokeys + Biosecrets**\n> **Please Note:** There are solutions available today (like [FaceTec](https://www.facetec.com/) and [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/)) that solve the same issues presented here. This paper seeks to outline a web 3-based system (decentralized + open source) that can run without a centralized actor, while not providing specifics to accomplish these goals. This is more of a thought experiment than a suggestion or requirement. \n\n**Biometric secrets (biosecrets)** are akin to any cryptographic private key, but they are your actual biological data, or, more specifically, a four dimensional expression of your humanness from which biometric data is collected. \n\nInstead of a private key generated alongside a public key, **a hash of quantized biometric data becomes your public key**, which is paired with your **actual flesh-and-blood-and-sound-and-movement-data, your private/secret key**, or as we call it \"**biosecret**\" which isn't stored on any server or blockchain. \n\n## Keys  \n1. **Biosecret**: A biosecret is a specific biometric expression that is quantized using cartesian grids into data points with a precision that makes it replicable for the individual in the future, but impossible for another person to duplicate, even an identical twin.\n\n2. **Biokey**: The biometric information that makes up a biosecret is hashed into a public biokey, making the original biometrics practically impossible to reconstruct for a biokey.\n\n\n\n## How this can go wrong\nIn today's biometric space, static images are most commonly used for things like fingerprint and facial recognition, and geometry is the means to compare this data. Biometric secrets generated from static images are not secure, as static images can be faked. [2] Video offers a better solution to this problem, as it is harder to fake, can include audio, and lets developers create a whole new set of algorithms based on a changing stream of data. [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/) is one company using video for biometric verification. \n\n\n## What could be used to generate a biokey?\nThis stream of data (video + audio biometric expression) could be a user doing a series of hand gestures, singing a part of a song, speaking a phrase, speaking a phrase in different voices, clapping, making a series of facial expressions or movements, or anything else one can imagine.\n\nFor security, biometric expressions (used to make a biokey) must be unique (for example, which combination of words to speak) and many types must be available (gestures, movement, singing, clapping, etc) and used in combination. **If each person's biokey was generated from the same single biometric expression, it would be a matter of time before specific AI could be developed to deepfake it for anyone**. If the user is the only one that knows their biometric expressions it becomes nearly impossible to guess the type and nature of the expression, and even if that is known, difficult to use the same technique on more than one account. The nature of the uniqueness could be chosen by the user, or generated at random from the biokey software which would prompt the user to complete an action in a specific way. \n\n## Why do we need this, again?\nDemocratic systems certainly are being built without biometric verification, and will continue to be even after suitable biometric technology develops along the open source, client-side requirements. For now, **decentralized solutions** like [Civic](https://www.civic.com/), and centralized tech like [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/FaceTec_3D_Face_Matching_Whitepaper.pdf) provide the necessary individuality at the cost of trust and requirement of citizenship. Additionally, **biometric data can be avoided entirely** by using a social verification platform like [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) As different projects implement web 4 in their own ways, the ideas presented thus far will develop as flaws are found. And there's always the ability to use a whitelist, the most low-tech, high-trust, and simplest solution.\n\n## Trust Issues\nThe biggest issue with biometrics is the lack of trust the general population has (or should have) with giving up their biometric data, including the growing number of facial recognition softwares and databases. The lack of trust is almost always associated with an individual's **lack of clear consent**, and lack of understanding the technology itself. \n\n### To alleviate the trust issue, biokey generators must be: \n1) **open-source**\n2) entirely run on the individual's hardware (**client-side**), and \n3) **not expose any biometric data** to any other users or to a web 4 system itself (the biosecret is never stored or transmitted in any way). \n\nThere will always be **security concerns** with biometrics. For example, if a user uses their biometric secret to unlock their mobile device, another app could be secretly recording the camera in the background. A person could record them doing their secret, and try to play that video back to the camera to gain access. Also, *[deepfakes](https://github.com/aerophile/awesome-deepfakes) exist*. These concerns must be addressed before this module of web 4 reaches mass adoption. \n\nThe upside of biosecrets is they **cannot be lost**, and the account will always be **recoverable by the individual**. In a web 4 ecosystem, where the tokens are distributed daily and often spent daily, a hack would be much less catastrophic. The attacker will be able to access the user's balance, but not alter the past transactions, nor continue to collect the future deposits, because the real user will (in theory) quickly recover the account and change the biometric secret generation means so that the hacker's biofake is no longer working. \n\n___\n# **3**\n\n___\n\n##  Information Entropy\nWeb 3 focuses on storing information forever in a provable way. Web 4 introduces a **counter-model** which may be **optionally** adopted by any time-token-based system. In this model, who did what becomes **harder and harder to know** the more time that passes. \n\nThis idea hinges upon incremental time units, the number of which is used to decide how difficult information about a particular individual is to access. This can be implemented by increasing the difficulty required to verify a transaction chain, or economically by increasing the fees associated with accessing or interacting with old transactions or smart contracts. \n\nWith **information entropy**, it is difficult, but not impossible, to piece together a story about an individual user by knowing they are responsible for a set of transactions over time. The further back in time a transaction is, the **harder** it is to link it to another transaction with any **certainty**. \n\n## Information Entropy and Biosecrets\nInformation fidelity requirements can also be degraded over time. For example, when generating a user's biokey, it can be assumed that the more time that passes, the more the biometrics of the individual will change. \n\n### Degradation of Biokeys\n**Biokeys** are generated from a **range of biometric values**. This range of values can be expanded over time based on specific, well researched paths. The effect is, instead of having one hashed biokey for eternity, the generation process will create a set of biokeys from an increasingly **wide range of data**. This concept may be needed to keep people in control of their accounts as they age. There is considerable work to be done to develop this concept, as each data type has its own considerations and complications. \n\nIn this case, as time goes on, someone attempting to prove their individuality would have to spend a lot **more effort** to run the algorithms against their collected biodata, and the data **precision** needed to match the person's identity is actually **lower**. This is one example of **fidelity change**; others can make it more expensive to change a record from the past, make it harder to find out the ID of a voter, or even limit a past state's effect on the future of a blockchain. \n\n## Proceed with Caution \nWhile the inclusion of this concept into web 4 may seem **unnecessary** at the moment, it is another guarantee of the privacy that is needed for many **social applications**. Philosophically, degradation of information also fits in with the general web 4 desire to reflect [systems in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics). \n\nBefore moving on, I do wish to stress the modularity of web 4, and that this (perhaps the most radical idea presented) is not going to fit into every web 4 system, nor should it. This idea will find its usefulness when it is time, and should NOT be adopted without clear reasoning. \n\n\n___\n# **4**\n\n___\n# Geo-Social Systems: Geotribes + Geodomains\n\nThe geo-social systems apt to be improved by web 4 are those which involve **people collaborating**, like government/legislation, food and water management, community projects, education, events, charities, environmental protection and more. Web 4 can also be used by organizations so employees can have a direct say in the actions and direction of their companies and non-profits.\n\nCollaborative geo-social systems are always happening everywhere humans live. Currently, we are collectively deciding what direction we should be moving as a society, from representative governments, to social media. However, human growth in the past few centuries has been focused on technological improvements rather than social improvements. [3] To harness the power of the information age for the collaboration of humans, web 4 should be used to enhance, introduce, and replace current structures that organize our societies. \n\n> Web 4 proposes that systems based in time token are the most apt to create and improve existing social layers. \n\n## What is a Geo-Social System?\n\nA geo-social system is something that affects people (**social**) at a given bounded area (**geo**). To refer to a group of people associated with a certain area, we'll call them a **geotribe**, and to refer to that area we'll call it a **geodomain**. \n\n## Concepts\n\n1. **Geodomain**: A bounded area that has an associated group of people who are running a democratic (web 4) system. \n\n2. **Geotribe**: The group of people associated with a geodomain that are participants in a web 4 system.\n\nGeodomains can be nested, with a finite set of smaller areas making up the larger area, common in geopolitics, but this is not required. Geodomains can also be overlapping or non-overlapping.\n\n\n## Creating Geo-social Systems\nTo create a geo-social system, we first must define the requirements of the geodomain, and then the requirements for an individual to be a part of the geotribe within that geodomain. \n\n### Geodomain Stratification  \nAcross the globe, **one geopolitical pattern** seems to emerge, though names vary. Cities are within Counties, are within States, are within Nations, are within the World. \n\n1. Cities (aka Towns, Commonwealths, etc.)\n2. Counties (aka Divisions\n3. States (aka Districts, Provinces)\n4. Nations (aka Countries, States, Republics, etc)\n5. Global\n \n> Additionally, a **community level** may be added within cities to further add accuracy and usefulness. \n\nUsing this existing geopolitical stratification is recommended for those wishing to build a web 4 system because it makes varying global systems easily storable in a one relational database model or similar data structure, and is understood by local people, governments, etc. \n\nOnce we have our geodomains, we must define what makes a geotribe.  \n\n### Geotribal Bonds\nTraditionally, it's the existence within a certain area, such as a place of residence or business, that is of importance for things like taxes, voting, and citizenship. When building a geo-social system, it's only necessary that an association is declared that is relevant for that system, which may or may not involve proving residency. \n\nIt is important for every system that each individual only exist within one geotribe (excluding those extrapolated) so that their vote isn't counted twice. \n\nWhen using stratified geodomains, such as geopolitically-based ones, only the deepest level of association is needed (city/community), from which the rest can be extrapolated.\n\nIf a geopolitically-based geodomain system allows geotribe members to declare their own associated location without proof, the member is incentivized to be honest, as they will receive the most benefit from having their opinion heard where it matters to them. \n\nAll \"non-proof\" systems should place restrictions on switching voluntarily-given geodomain association too often (such as once per 6 months) to prevent influencing foreign affairs. \n \n\n# High-Fidelity Democracy \n\nBy offering time tokens to the individual that correspond to each stratum we can create **high-fidelity democratic systems** that better represent each and every person's desires. We can know exactly what the people want, with no guesswork and 0 middlemen, in a very short period of time. \n\nFor example, a person may be given 12 time tokens per month at each stratum to vote on the initiatives that they would like to see passed. They may vote all 12 tokens for an initiative they are most passionate about, or 1 token to 12 different initiatives (or 2 to 6 initiatives, etc). By collecting and counting these tokens, the governing body can **know exactly what their constituents want**, without the direct need to elect a representative who only estimates these desires. \n\nThe democratic system described in this paper does not solve all problems, as there are still issues of voter informedness, unseen actors, and more, but it is a skeleton to build a collaborative social system that are an **improvement to the representative governments** which were once as revolutionary as these ideas are. \n\n\n# Roadmap to Web 4 Reality\n\n## **Phase One**\n> Implementing time tokens\n\n**Time Tokens** are implemented on any and all blockchains where developers see the value. These developers provide open-source instructions and tools to helps other developers incorporate time tokens into their applications. \n\n**Provable individuality** for Time Tokens is up to each application and blockchain, and these application can choose to ignore this requirement, risking their systems' integrity. **Federated** (Facetec) and **decentralized** (Civic) options may be used, and so can social verification (BrightID).\n\n**Information entropy** and **geo-social systems** are starting to be theorized, but not showing up. \n\n**Phase 1 Action Points**: \n- Time Token ERC proposal on Ethereum (and similar for other blockchains)\n- Developers exploring use cases for Time Tokens \n\n\n## **Phase Two**\n> dApps and discovering issues\n\n**Applications using Time Tokens** are widespread, and issues in implementations are becoming known and solved. Developers who open time token faucets are seeing their token be used in third-party apps in ways they didn't foresee. \n\n**Provable identity issues** are becoming apparent, as certain applications with **lax rules** are being manipulated, showing the need for true provable identity. The best solutions are becoming known alongside the problems.\n\n**Information entropy** principles are starting to be implemented, when required.\n\n**Geo-social systems** are starting to be built, but not used for \"real applications\" like running a government because of lack of true provable individuality, and social inertia.\n\n**Phase 2 Action Points**: \n- Proposing the best uses for geo-social systems using time tokens\n- Incorporating different provable identity methods\n- Developers implementing Time Token in unexpected ways\n\n## **Phase Three**\n> Implementing Provable Identity\n\n**Provable Identity** is now possible as suggested in this manifesto through the maturity of the biometric secrets. Standards are being created openly, or, it is decided that the way presented here is not needed as a better way is found.\n\n**Geo-social systems** are being used to run and govern communities which are not dependent on traditional representative government. Existing governments are adopting time tokens to get a better read on what legislation the people want. \n\nOrganizations of all sizes are using time tokens to shift power to employees. \n\n**Phase 3 Action Points**: \n- Picking provable identity solutions that satisfy all requirements\n- Possibly abandoning biometric system presented here\n- Communities running on web 4\n- Governments benefiting from web 4\n- Organizations using web 4\n\n## **Phase Four**\n> Geo-social systems\n\n**Information entropy** is added to the systems where it can be of use. For example, this could make a person's (anonymous) voting record less knowable over time by increasing the amount of CPU time needed to associate one vote with another. \n\n**Geo-social systems** are being used as a replacement for representative government where it is the will of the people. Voter informedness is measured and known, as are the exact desires of the people. This creates collaboration and a renewed faith in democracy, and a feeling of belongingness and appreciation for each individual. \n\n**Phase 4 Action Points**: \n- Building and operating geo-social systems for the benefit of society and any collaborating group\n- Exploring use cases and integrating information entropy where appropriate\n\n# Author notes\n\n## Change Without Conflict\n**No one can stop us** from building collaborative systems with web 4 and even **self-governing**. **We don't need** to \"tear down the system\" or separate from society to do so. **Web 4 can exist** fully embedded in the geopolitical systems around us, while implementing and improving the four concepts, the underpinnings of collaborative democracy.\n\nIf and when the \"old system\" meets its demise, as all things do, **we can transition rapidly** to a web 4 system like [Effective Collective](https://github.com/dougbutner/effective-collective) or any other, as this solution will already be in place. \n\n## Why use the term \"Web 4\"\nIt is my belief that each version of the web must 1) be built on top of the previous version, 2) be fundamentally different than the previous version by introducing new technology, and 3) have meaningful impact on society. \n\nThis proposal for the next iteration of the web is an effort to both expand and shift the path of information science in a direction where the **meaningful impact** of society involves: 1) empowerment of each individual, which serve as the basis for collective (social), economic, and novel applications; 2) provable identity verification while maintaining complete separation from any federated system, including government, with the side-benefit of lifelong recoverability of biokeys with biosecrets; and 3) resonance with our contained and containing systems, like our human organs and the Solar system, which provide us with life and free energy daily, akin to free time tokens.\n\nWhile an argument could easily be made that DeFi is Web 4, or another emerging tech, like \"layer 2\" blockchains (rollups) are web 4, both of these are **not new**. DeFi mimics and improves the systems of the past. Rollups are merely making web 3 **more efficient**. \n\nIt is my hope and desire that the information presented here will be **expanded** on and **implemented** by many developers and systems in the coming years, not for the benefit of the few, but for the **empowerment** of each individual and the **harmony** of the human collective, and every layer of Gaia. \n\n___\n# Notes + References\n___\n\n[1] - Solutions like Civic and Facetec have proved to be effective in verifying individuality. KYC services rely on government-issued identification, physical signature, and minimal, often human-checked bioverification. Until the technology is developed for a biometric system resembling the ideas here, these options (as well as social verification) are viable, though not fully embodying the idea of web 4. \n\n[2] - Hao, K. & O'Neill P.

I too hate trying to weed through all of the paid, outdated, or poorly written articles and blogs to find relevant information.\n\nWhen I'm going to make a large purchase I often make a spreadsheet to compare all of the top options. It would be cool if you could add a comparison table mode and everyone could update it as new solutions are released and old solutions are updated or killed off... like a wikipedia of best of/comparisons.\n\nUX: I searched for a couple of things I'm currently looking for and I didn't find anything, which is fine, but it took me way too long to notice the new bar that appears below the search with the status text in gray that tells me it's searching or no results were found. Maybe you could give that bar, or the header bar, some contrast or color so it's more noticable.\n\nDesign: the bootstrap styles (or whatever it is) are nice and simple but it could use some bitmap graphics to add some depth and variety; and it would be a fun site to browse, even if I wasn't looking for something specific. Maybe there could be icons or graphics for the categories so you can easily see which category a post belongs to from the homepage list. If a particular post gets popular you could add a picture to convey it's topic more quicly when someone is scanning the list (or maybe automate fetching images from a stock photo site and users can indicate it if it's good/relevant or not).\n\nAnyway, just some ideas and feedback, take it or leave it. Good luck with the site!",

        "selftext": "Considering a Woo based SaaS service.\n\nOwn an ecommerce agency and I've been considering this for a while. Many don't like Shopify for numerous reasons I won't go in depth with (lack of flexibility, SEO, fees, monthly app charges etc.)\n\nI've considered creating a platform where the entire platform/Woo install is managed for you. \"Isn't this just WPEngine?\" I hear you ask. No. Because it'll focus specifically on WooCommerce and the updates will be managed, installed and tested for you without the need for a developer if it goes wrong like WPE. It'll also have a customised WP-Admin backend that's entirely focused on Ecommerce, so the ecommerce part doesn't feel like an afterthought stuck below blogs in the side menu. Everything from payments to analytics will be set up for you and ready to go. Then we'll review and work with store owners to help optimise and drive conversions (they can subscribe to a higher plan where we'll build the entire store or they can subscribe to a plan which implements the changes we'll suggest monthly for free). I'd price it in line with Shopify. We are already doing this for clients, this is just a fancy way of moving it up a level and making it subscription based. \n\nFor plugins I could even go as far as to fork or create new plugins which are specific to the platform which implement features which should be core by now. \n\nIt's the management/ease of Shopify with the ability to still own your store and get some flexibility when needed. \n\nThoughts? \n\n\n\n",

You look like every other low-budget mass-produced website farm out there. GG to your business.\n3. No dev is going to be excited to work at this company. That means devs are going to leave and backfilling is going to be hard.\n4. One of the unspoken perks of bespoke websites it is a little harder for your clients to walk away.

They ended up spending 10's of millions of dollars to port it all to postgres.\n\nRelational Databases are really good at answering questions you don't even know you are going to ask yet. Document oriented DB's can be good for purely transactional systems that do not have depth or interconnected data and the scope of what the application will do will not increase (you will not ask new questions of the data). As soon as it does, they become a tar pit.

Absolutely 0 network overhead to search and filter through the data. It was great.\n\nThe manifest was pure JSON, so it's kind of like your problem.

The reason comes down to race conditions, but what does that mean? For example, if 2 people post a blog at the same time, they both pull the same file, and save a new version of the file with their post, but since they pulled the file at the same time, their new file won't have each other's post, meaning someone is getting their post overwritten. Most DBs can handle this in a few ways, and you could too in your code, though unless you want to learn that, use a db.\n\nIf you aren't letting people update via the app, then you need to ask how many people will use your app, as the file grows, generally you'll find stuff starts to slow since normally you'll need to read the file from disk into memory, and THEN query for the results. If you don't expect GB level files (probably even hundreds of megs is too much), then JSON is probably fine, otherwise do the db. \n\nA final suggestion that I've seen, go the middle ground, sqlite, it punches above its weight and gives you much better performance",

Depending on your architecture and use case (Again Write is the issue, Read is no problem at all), If you could set it up for example that every User has it's own file and only the user can write something to the file one time for a single page load, and you've got no fancy independent functionality (Cron Jobs, Queue workers, etc) that would try to write to the file at the same time, and one user can't write to the file contents of another user, Then that should be safe enough to function without any issue. But if you have any situation at all where Multiple processes could write to the same file at the same time, Just use an SQL database and save yourself the headache and system issues that will inevitably screw up your application someway somehow at some point.\n\nEDIT: After reading the details, It looks like you're wanting a blog content stored with the file system. If you make a Single File per blog id and each file contains just the single json object for that blog id and it's created once and accessed read only, That should be no problem at all. If you want to use a single file with the Json Object containing all blog details (Not sure why you'd want to do that over making multiple files with the ID of the blog, Maybe ease of access / search?) Then that could be dangerous unless you can ensure you only have one update to the file at any given time say from a single admin account, and everyone else would be read only.  \n  \nAgain it should work on a small scale, But 1) Multiple Concurrent writes to the file system are DANGEROUS when directly accessing the filesystem yourself through your application, and 2) It's not scalable -- Depending on the size of your server running the application, it will slow down / crash after the file (Or number of files) gets too big (However Files with just plaintext like JSON objects can get REALLY Big before running into trouble like crashing, so I'd think performance speed would be your biggest issue after maybe a few tens of thousands of objects / files on a small server)",

Yeah, not a real database. I am quite sure that Linux and windows don't corrupt the file system (too much) when they crash \"while\" renaming. I think this is basically an atomic operation. Disks use sectors to store data. I just hope that the whole directory fits into a sector. So the new version of this sector is written into local RAM of the HDD (or SSD) controller. Only a complete sector is written. I think that this storage hardware has big enough capacitors to finish this write even in case of external power loss. I don't quite know what a Journaling file system is. For me it is the responsibility of the hardware to make that write atomic. Just like RAM is supposed to make atomic 64 bit writes for pointers and floats. No threading issues there. Even 1993 Jaguar and later the N64 could do that. Java should not be used on 32 bit systems. At least, then stick to floats -- no double. I guess that pointers are okay because Java does not support 68k where pointers are twice the size of the databus. I wonder about 386SX.",

The latter is a problem everyone faces no matter what they choose.   \n  \nWhen a developer opts for things like Mongo to get up and running fast it is because they generally have not experienced supporting a large application over its lifetime and do not realize that the small amount of velocity they gain initially is paid for in orders of magnitude of complexity over the lifetime of the app as they try to bolt on features, and patch around the things Mongo lacks when compared to something like Postgres.",

This feels too slow, especially given that many clients request similar features (e.g., user management, dashboards, content management).\n\nI’ve been considering solutions like:\n\nCreating reusable templates or components for common features.\n\nUsing low-code/no-code tools for rapid prototyping.\n\nStreamlining the onboarding and requirements-gathering process.\n\nStandardizing certain types of projects for faster configuration and deployment.\n\n\nHowever, I’m curious to hear from others in the industry:\n\n1. How do larger software companies or agencies manage to deliver complex projects so quickly?\n\n\n2. Am I being unrealistic in expecting shorter timelines for feature-rich platforms?\n\n\n3.

                "body": "Here’s a few tips from my perspective as a tech lead within my organisation:\n\n1. Don’t bother with no/low code solutions. You’ll end up hitting a wall and it will eventually slow down future progress because someone will inevitably want something not achievable or reasonably feasible from the platform. \n\n2. Look to replicate, not duplicate. This means find a way to consistently repeat and automate common patterns instead of doing the same thing over and over in subtly different ways. Auth is a good example that is basically the same everywhere and can be done once and then configuration driven. \n\n3. Set up a common template to bootstrap a product with initial dependencies, standards and process, structure, conventions to get a head-start on the core things. This could be routing layer + auth + state management for frontend, db + api for backend. Then it could be as simple as `git clone` every time. \n\n4. Define a sensible recommended tech stack with just the basics. This could be “we suggest this starting point with React, Postgres, and Express using this initial template” and let the product team decide if it’s suitable and what extras they need to do themselves. Start with one tech stack that covers your most common bases, add another only when you find out there’s enough demand for a new stack and not just because “we think we need every stack under the sun”\n\n5. Don’t put inexperienced people on a product in its first few weeks. Juniors are great for working/learning on the well-defined bulk of grunt tasks.. but setting up a project, establishing overall architecture, getting a “lay of the land” feeling and ways of working is best left to seniors. You’ll find that velocity will pick up very quickly when there are no juniors getting in the way early on.",

No agile, useless meetings and any useless project management stuff. Just a Trello board of things to do will do. It requires a lot of trust, but if deploying daily you can check progress yourself, without having to involve Devs. \n\n2. Constant iteration and client feedback. it kind of depends on client, but if I can I push everything to prod or staging ( depending if greenfield or no ), move the card to Trello column for my client to review and try them to review it in a week time at most.\n\n3. Using full fledged frameworks. For me it's symfony, but laravel, Django, spring and many others are in play. Using framework that your Devs didn't choose is pointless so they should pick it and stick to it whenever you can. Unfortunately JS kind of sucks when it comes to those, although it's getting better. Laravel is probably the speed king although I think spring and symfony are really close by while being more manageable ( very personal preference ). If you are on lower Dev complexity unfortunately wp takes the rains, even that no serious Dev wants to work with it.\n\n4. Boilerplates, code generators ( like make command in symfony ), static analysis, ansible/terraform recipes and much more on automation front.\n\n5. What one programmer can do in a month two can do in two months. You need to be careful about bus factor here though.\n\n6. Managing burn out. If you run your Devs like horses they will burn out and quit or just clock out and deliver 1/10. No way around it. Pay well, don't expect people to stay after hours. Be flexible with holidays/working hours especially to the people that put extra effort. Steady and constant is better than burst of performance.\n\nIt's very important to understand those rules are working for me. They might not for you or your team.

Founders aren’t limited by a 40 hour work week. Should it be this way? No, especially not for ICs. But as an owner, especially the first 18 months, I worked until I felt I did what was needed to be done for tomorrow. I would never have, expect, or ask one of my employees to do this, nor would I expect you to.\n2. We don’t get paid until we have a product. \n3. Our employees own parts of the business. So all incentives are aligned. \n4. We build things using the technology we are best at, not what our customer wants \n5. We don’t have to scope an entire project before starting work, or agree on a scope of work at all. We build what we need to build as we need to build it. \n6. The art of the bodge. We have thousands of automated tests, but sometimes you just need something to work. That type of decision is easier when I don’t have a client to report to. We can get it in production and add tests once we know it works. \n8. We are only ever building one thing, our product. We understand how our product works, what our market is, who our customer is. This allows us to be more autonomous and execute more quickly.\n9. Our test suite pays dividends. As we develop more features and expand the product all the work we did on tests before ensure nothing breaks. Investing that time when shipping for clients will really slow you down. \n\nWhat I would do is figure out where in each project you are spending the most time. All advice people are giving you is poorly advised because we don’t know where you are spending time.\n\nHow much time is spent requirements gathering. My team spends less than a few hours requirements gathering. How much time do you spend bootstrapping code before feature development. How much time do you spend in meetings each week. My team has 3 team syncs with the entire company for 30 minutes each and 1 engineering meeting directly after that. I have 1 1:1 with each employee and that’s it. 3 hours total of meetings and even that is pushing it. But all the meetings are also streamed in time so that we only have to break flow once. (A meeting from 9-9:30 then from 10-10:30 with lunch at 12 really means no one will work until after lunch.)",

                "body": "Hi! It’s great that you’re proactively looking for ways to improve your development timelines. As someone who has worked on similar challenges, here are some practical suggestions to help reduce turnaround time while maintaining quality:\n\n1. Modular Architecture:  Beyond reusable templates, adopting a modular development approach can significantly cut down on development time. Build a library of well-tested modules (e.g., authentication, payment integrations, dashboards) that can be easily plugged into new projects.  \n\n2. Automated Processes: Automate repetitive tasks like code linting, testing, and deployment using CI/CD pipelines. This reduces manual effort and ensures consistent quality.  \n\n3. Low-Code/No-Code Tools: These are great for prototyping or less complex projects. They can help you deliver an MVP quickly, which can then be refined into a fully customized solution later.  \n\n4. Scoping and Communication: Spend more time upfront with clients to define clear requirements and scope. A solid understanding of what’s needed minimizes scope creep and unnecessary revisions.  \n\n5. Dedicated Frameworks or Platforms: Use frameworks tailored for rapid development like Flutter for cross-platform apps or Laravel for web apps. They have built-in tools to speed up common tasks.  \n\n6. Standardized Project Types: If many of your clients request similar features, consider offering pre-defined project packages. For example, a “dashboard package” or “e-commerce starter kit” with fixed timelines and costs.  \n\n7. Agile Methodology: Break projects into smaller sprints with well-defined deliverables. This allows you to deliver incremental value and reduces the pressure of delivering everything at once.  \n\nRegarding your questions:  \n\n1. How do larger companies deliver quickly? They achieve this through extensive resource allocation, larger development teams, and a higher degree of specialization (e.g., dedicated UI/UX teams, backend teams, etc.). They also heavily invest in automation and scalable processes.  \n\n2. Are shorter timelines unrealistic? Not at all, but they require optimization. By implementing the above strategies, you can reduce timelines significantly without compromising on quality. However, keep in mind that rushing too much can sometimes lead to technical debt, so balance is key.  \n\nHope this helps! Would love to hear how your journey progresses.",

In many cases duplication or “less efficient” work is totally okay as long as you keep your eye on when it will - not has, will - no longer be a net benefit to productivity.\n\nA UI library is a good example of “it can help us get off the ground and test the waters, but it doesn’t align or it’s too much effort to customise to our brand, and will need to be replaced”. Being aware of what the point of usefulness is early on will enable you to be prepared. Preventing surprises this way will avoid stressful refactoring, mad scrambles, crunch, expensive overtime, and burnout.\n\nSome mentoring strategies I can attest to includes:\n\n- Have a junior sit with a senior as they talk about their thought process as they go. This is quite passive learning but it lets them absorb intrinsic knowledge through observation. In many ways a senior won’t be able to articulate why they do a certain thing since it does become instinctual over time\n- Give them room to explore and make mistakes and use them as teachable moments. Rather than endless “training” resources or hoping that they pick things up naturally as they go, when they inevitably hit a roadblock, give them a 1-2hr window to find a solution on their own. Then they can talk to a senior and say “I tried this and that but it’s not working, here’s where I’m stuck at the moment”. Use that as the starting point to teach why their initial approach didn’t work and guide towards the right solution. ",

I come in to fix complex projects where there’s always something risky eg using an open source library for  web streaming which doesn’t work but would save you 2 months of time vs building a custom one via webrtc — but it ends up that you had to custom build it anyway because the client needs multiple streams open at once.\n\nBasically there’s generally some client req that makes using an off the shelf solution non-viable or only known to be viable/non-viable after implementation. I prefer the approach where you custom build the highest core competency of your business because it’s likely to be non-standard anyway. Save yourself the headache of wasting 2 weeks - 2 months building around something off the shelf, then retooling it for a month only to go and rebuild from scratch. \n\nThe whole point of a successful product is differentiation. So the top 1-2 things that are differentiated you should approach from a custom build out perspective while using off the shelf for everything else like auth or push notifications etc\n\nI would say it takes 4 months on average to build a valuable b2b SaaS business without the bells and whistles like billing and user management and sso. That may spike to 6-12 months easily if it’s highly technical like 3D modeling or supporting old file formats from the 80s.\n\nMy final answer is it depends on how complete the definition of production is at start and depends on if the definition of production changes throughout the build.",

                "body": "Just do what I do. 11ty static site generator. Clone my website starter kit \n\nhttps://github.com/CodeStitchOfficial/Intermediate-Website-Kit-SASS\n\nIt’s got everything you need. It has the DecapCMS already configured with a working blog the client can edit themselves in a dashboard. The documentation shows you how to use everything. You can extend the cms to cover the text sections on other pages and make everything in your site editable from the cms. Just gotta create the new yaml collections for each page or section you want to edit. \n\nThis is what I use for all my sites now. I just launched this site using it\n\nhttps://grassrootsplumbing.com\n\nTheir resources page is a repurposed blog. The client can edit the current resources and add new ones without having to bother me. Here’s an example of an active blog a client curates\n\nhttps://www.yourherocare.com/blog/\n\nI use Netlify to host these sites for free and they also do free form handling for up to 100 submissions per month per site. No backend configuration needed. You go to your form settings on the site page and enter the email you want it to go to. That’s it. \n\nIf you need more help reintegrating into the freelancing world, I wrote this guide on how I built up my agency and how to sell yourself against page builders and cheap devs overseas. \n\n https://codestitch.app/complete-guide-to-freelancing\n\nAnd I wrote this on how to optimize your websites page speed scores to 100/100\n\nhttps://codestitch.app/page-speed-handbook\n\nThis is an important ability because it’s also one of the core pillars of my pitch. Google’s core vitals are a very important set of metrics that impact how your site ranks. The page speed insights scores tell you how those metrics are doing. Websites with similar content online trying to rank for the same keywords will battle it out for the rankings. But the one with the better page speed will win if all other factors are equal. It’s that competitive edge small businesses need online. And it’s why my work is worth what I charge - I know what google wants to see and I give it to them. Page speed isn’t everything though. Content is number 1. And this is where you as a freelancer need to nail if you want them to rank and be happy. \n\nEverything I do is called on page SEO. That’s the content, design, and load times. Things I can control as a developer. What I do is I do searches for my clients keywords in large city metro areas in a different state and open all the top ranking sites. I analyze the keywords they’re using and content, feed it into chatGPT and have it write new content based on that content from those pages and to pretend it’s a copywriter for websites. Then it gives me the content, I edit it to make it sound more human or change sentence structure, and add it to the site. I know what sections I need on a site and what order and what content I need and where to put the keywords. I do this for interior service pages called content silos as well. These content silos are pages dedicated to 1 service. That entire page is all about that 1 service. Like this page I did\n\nhttps://striveptwellness.com/multiple-sclerosis-treatment/\n\nThis ranks #1 for “multiple sclerosis therapy Montclair ca”. These pages are how you rank for dozens and hundreds of keywords and have these pages ranking front page for any and every service your client offers. That + my designs + my expertise in making a site load instantly and score 100/100 on google page speed scores and satisfy all of google core vital metrics for ranking I can make a website rank front page.\n\nI can do all that without being an SEO specialist. I focus on the fundamentals and what google wants to see. Sure traditional SEO helps like backlinks, blogs, guest posting, and content creation and outreach. But if you don’t have the budget for that then you can get by focusing on the stuff you can control on the page.\n\nThese content silos are bitchin for running ads to as well. They convert VERY well. Run an ad for interior painting services and send them to the interior painting services page. The user clicks on an ad for that and is taken to a page that talks all about it and they find exactly what they came there for. Most small business owners send ads to their home page. But when someone goes there they have to go  looking for that service they clicked on the ad for. And if it’s not there they bounce. And then the business owner wonders why none of their ads are converting.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about freelancing. I’d be happy to bring you back up to speed!",

I have a template library I built with my team that I use for all my projects. \n\nhttps://codestitch.app/app\n\nWhat I did with this one is the client had a boxy site that was boring. They wanted something more wavy and flowy. They gave me this example\n\nhttps://wondercow.com\n\nAnd I went to my template library, had their site open in a different screen and I went down my my library from the top of their site to the bottom and picked the templates I felt best worked to create the design I needed to in the style of the inspiration site they gave me. I had a couple with some svg waves like that, so I grabbed the figma design files form each template and pieced together a new figma design with them. I edited the svg waves, doubled them up, overlapped them, and edited the other templates to match the design style I was going for. I had the design done in about an hour or two. Then I go back to my library and click the button to copy and paste the code into my code editor inside the starter kit I have. It took another hour or two to add the templates and then customize them to match the design I made, then tweak the dark mode and remake the svg waves with the dark mode colors and hide the light version ones when dark mode is enabled and show the dark ones when it’s enabled. Then I tweaked the blog that my kit comes with to look more like a resources page that the client can edit themselves and not so much like a blog. \n\nNetlify is where I host the sites for free and they do free form handling for up to 100 emails per month per site. They host static html and css sites. Which makes 11ty that much more powerful because it basically does everything php does but statically without the server side language. With this workflow I have a really nice assembly line that allows me to make beautiful sites in only a few hours. I also built this site with my library \n\nhttps://www.yourherocare.com\n\nThis one was much more custom but if you look through my library, you’ll see the templates they were based on. The idea is the templates aren’t exactly what you need everytime. Sometimes they can get you 90% the way there and you finish the other 10%. That’s how I see them. I made the most beautiful weed shop site last week that I’m going to start putting together on Monday. I’m actually really happy how it turned out in the design process. That’s gonna be a nice one. And I have a non profit one I’m working too that was all made with my templates. \n\nhttps://pacificsafetycenterdemo.netlify.app\n\nThe Motorcycle pages don’t work as of today, still putting those pages together. But you can see the variety I’m able to create from just templates. The word templates often get a bad rap because it’s often seen as low quality and low effort. But if you’re using something that was made with care and purpose and detail then that template is actually a very valuable tool. When made properly, they can be used for anything!",

Switching between the normal UI and a “code editor mode” would be great, even if just for individual CSS classes. For example, having to individually set padding on each edge is annoying rather than just being able to write ‘padding: 1em 2em’. Also that the only way you can edit global classes is to create a div with only that class applied and edit the options for that element. I also wish there was support for calc().

        "selftext": "I finally managed to get an interview after tons of applications and immediate rejections. However, this was though a recruited who reached out to me. The job was for a pure frontend React position and I studied my buns off ahead of it. I've been working as a frontend dev with some backend chops for a few years now but only using Vue and PHP (mostly Laravel) so I spent a ton of time learning React through developing. In a couple weeks I built out a CMS from scratch using Next + Supabase and felt so confident going into the interview.\n\nDuring the interview I crushed every React question thrown my way and used examples from my experience. Then the live coding part came... I had submitted a form on Codepen using React and walked through the code and made the updates they wanted. The last thing they wanted me to do was write a mock Promise and that's where I tripped up. So much of my experience in the last few years has been with some fetch API and not writing actual raw promises. I fumbled horribly and my confidence was shot so things got worse... Eventually they helped me through it and it worked but it was soul crushing.\n\nI know there are a lot of products/platforms out there to help prepare for coding interviews but I don't know which to go with. I realize there's always going to be a \"gotcha\" part to these interviews so I want to prepare for the next one.\n\nDoes anybody have any recommendations or experiences with any of these platforms? Or even just stories of similar experiences :)\n\nEdit: I definitely did not expect this many reactions and I'm super grateful for all the motivating and reassuring comments! I've always loved the online dev community for this reason but have never really leaned on it. Super appreciated for everyone that has taken the time to say something and I'm more motivated to continue becoming a better developer and interviewee.",

I am fishing to know how they handle front end consuming multiple APIs at the same time to render dynamic content. How they handle race conditions and disruptions when you. have multiple nested processes.\n\nThose are real scenarios regardless of a specific language. How do you handle multiple API calls from  multiple components on the same page. You don't want to call an API 5 or 6 times. How do you handle the order of the content if one time comes in first and you click on it, what happens next? These scenario can happen in any framework. You pick \"Rick\" from the drop down in an employee menu, it is fetching and now you accidently clicked on \"Mary.\" Then Rick's data comes in. And I never phrase it any framework. I even let them choose their stack and explain how they solve these scenarios.

However, I'm facing challenges with the client handoff process, especially when compared to more integrated platforms like Webflow, Framer, or WordPress.\n\n**Here’s the scenario:** When building websites with platforms like WordPress, Webflow,  etc., the handoff is straightforward — I simply transfer the project to the client's account, and they have everything in one place to manage and make updates as needed. **HOWEVER**, with Astro and most likely other modern frameworks, the process seems fragmented and potentially overwhelming for clients, especially small to medium-sized businesses.\n\nFor instance, to fully hand over a project:\n\n* Clients need a GitHub account for version control.\n* A Netlify/Vercel account for hosting.\n* An account for where the self-hosted CMS is (I am considering options like Directus or Payload to avoid monthly fees for my clients).\n* An account for the CMS itself to log in and make changes to the website.\n\nThis setup feels complex, particularly for clients who prefer owning their site without ongoing maintenance fees. They may find managing multiple accounts and interfaces daunting.\n\n**My questions to the community are:**\n\n1. Have you encountered similar challenges with modern frameworks like Astro?\n2. How do you simplify the handoff process while maintaining the autonomy and cost-effectiveness that clients desire?\n3. Are there tools or strategies that can integrate these services more seamlessly?\n4. If you've implemented custom solutions or found effective workarounds, could you share your experiences?\n\nAny insights, experiences, or advice on managing client handoffs in this context would be greatly appreciated. I'm particularly interested in solutions that could apply not only to Astro but also to other modern front-end frameworks facing similar issues.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

That’s just not going to work easily. You’ve optimized for a lot of cool and interesting things, but not for ease of handoff or ongoing maintenance. If your business involved a small retainer for maintenance (IE, anything that’s not done via the CMS) you’d likely avoid a lot of the problems here. Full handoff with no fees to non-technical users is a fairly large ask.\n\nSSGs are wonderful, but they require a full deploy pipeline with all kinds of connections in order to cause data updates to populate everything.

ACF Pro, because custom post types and fields are hella tedious to do manually and it already uses best practice ways of doing that - and Duplicator, to move from dev to prod effortlessly. \n\nAnything else I write the code myself. There’s nothing superfluous being added and what is being added is correct without any further fuckery. \n\n9/10 times it’s not even particularly complicated or difficult code. \n\n(Edits have turned this into a much longer rant I’m sorry!)\n\nLast week I had a custom archive that would’ve needed several plugins for a no-code solution, most of which would’ve had a bunch of unused features included for no purpose. Said archive needed to be grouped/organized by tax terms, alphabetical under each term, then reference a set of related posts in another post type for each main post, their tax terms, and a custom string attached to each of those tax terms. Then it needed to be heavily filterable on up to three different criteria, but the dataset for filter selects wouldn’t be complete until after the place in the document flow where those filters had to be. \n\nOne WP_Query Object is all I needed. A plugin route would’ve queried the DB dozens of times, one for each tax term, on each main post for each related post, just… no ugh.\n\nSure, I used that one query to build a four-level deep array. I did have to ksort the outermost array, and I still had to iterate through the nested arrays. But I only had to do it once. \n\nWhile generating and sorting the post/term object arrays I simultaneously built the filtering logic in the same iterations. Any faceting plugin would’ve had more queries and more iterations since, by necessity and by virtue of not being written around this specific scenario, it would’ve had to basically repeat the entire set of queries and iterations (the less optimized way, not my one-query way) just to get all the options. \n\nSome simple string concatenation and output buffering made the whole logic and output location discrepancy thing a complete non issue as well. \n\nI’m almost curious enough to try building the same thing with plugins just to see the performance difference. I honestly don’t even know if I could… but I can’t help but wonder. Like I used one query and one set of for each loops. I think with the amount of data that is actually used in this archive, using premade plugins could’ve easily been 100+ queries and loops for the same task. Actual nightmare scenario. \n\nAnd like, yeah it’s complicated by the standards of a WP post archive, but as far as writing php (and I guess a few dozen lines of vanilla JS for the DOM part of the filtering) it was actually pretty basic. The whole thing only took a few hours to write, test, debug, refactor, and call good. \n\nIf you wanted to point out that I had also written some other code for reusable components and templates that would be fair, but also… a function that takes an array + a string then returns html for a sorted dropdown out of it, or a simple bootstrap grid with ACF fields aren’t exactly day ruining tasks either. Maybe add another hour or two into it. Still well within what can be done in one day without even rushing.\n\nI’m not even a super experienced senior php dev or anything. Before late 2022 the last time I so much as looked at php was pasting phpBB mods into files circa 2004. Shoot, I dropped out of a CS program circa 2008 and turned my back on coding entirely for over a decade, minus the occasional leetcode style challenge (usually in Java) once or twice a year. \n\nNone of the syntax I used is anything that would be unfamiliar to an average intermediate dev. None of the logic I used was particularly outlandish. Honestly I probably didn’t even think of the single most performant solution either. Like I’m not that great of a dev. But if I can do that task in an efficient manner without plugins then I feel comfortable saying anyone who isn’t on their first month of php could do the same. \n\nAnd if you’re so adverse of code you can’t learn the basics of WP functions, string manipulation, and array traversal… what the hell are you doing building web sites at all?",

You're over complicating it for the client when using those systems as they have FAR too much granular control.\n\n2. You're over complicating the handover process. The client gets a website. That's all they care about. If they choose to move away from you, you supply the next person (client or otherwise) the site. The client doesn't need git repo access as 99.9999% of the time, they have no idea what it is or how it benefits them and even when they do learn that, they still won't use it. A git repo is primarily for making development changes trackable. No idea why you'd be using it if you're not developing custom themes or making theme changes outside of the database.\n\nAs for hosting, that's up to them. Your job is to advise from that perspective. You should be looking out for them and what's best for their project. Free hosting usually isn't up to much and so I'd deem that to not be in the best interest of the client. Availability, hosting location and host performance are paramount.

The work mostly consists of building off our boilerplate themes and customizing for the client. Nothing crazy - HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Sometimes we’ll do an API integration but nothing too complicated.\n\nI haven’t even really used React or modern frameworks in production as we just don’t push the need for it. The agency world is very much getting it done as fast as possible using what we already have/know. No time for new tech or pushing the boundaries.\n\nOver the years I’ve had titles beginning with Front End Developer, Senior Web Developer, and now Director of Web Development. All of the agencies I’ve worked for are small to mid-size - no larger than 50 employees. Currently working at a boutique agency of about 15 people.\n\nThe work is ok, I’m comfortable. It’s that comfort that I feel has significantly set me back and now I’m feeling extremely under-educated in the marketplace for web developers.\n\nThere are very likely jr level developers who know how to code more efficiently than I do and have much more knowledge of modern frameworks. I’ve been stuck either in project management, building processes or QA-type roles rather than actual coding for the last 3-4 years. \n\nMy current agency is likely going to be underwater in the new year and I can see the writing on the wall that I’ll likely be terminated with some severance in the new year.\n\nI guess what I'm looking for some guidance on is what would you do in my shoes to bring me back to the forefront of development?\n\nShould I just take some courses on modern frameworks and build out some projects?\n\nShould I try and push my current agency to adopt something new and then use that on my portfolio?\n\nI fell out of the constant learning cycle years ago - a cushy salary + working from home just made life so easy to not push for more and be content. Yes, I’m now going to pay for it. \n\nMy salary is north of 100k and I feel like I’m trapped in the agency world as that’s all I’ve ever known and done. I’m ready to exit to something else, but I don’t feel like I have the knowledge to compete with director-level programmers who have had more experience coding.\n\nExperienced web developers of reddit, what would you do in my shoes? \n\nTLDR; Developer of 10+ years in the marketing agency world, feeling under-educated - looking for advice on how to level up my skills to be competitive in the developer marketplace once again as I know I’ll be looking for work in the next 60-90 days.

Doesn't have to be full on \"case-studies\" but this will help you take stock of what you've worked on and the scope. That's useful for getting your story straight and can be useful to sell yourself. You might find that the projects are cooler than you remember. You also might find that they are missing some key things / that way you know what to do next. Get a visual designer or coach to help you and speed things up if you're feeling stuck.\n2. Pick out what job you want next. \"Whatever - I'm OK with anything as long as it's not horrible\" - is NOT ok. So, get really clear on what you'd actually really want if you had a choice - and write it down. Start collecting info about those places and what they'd need to see to give you agency or a buffer to learn / or whatever you need from them.\n3. I'd get this book *exercise for programmers* (prag prog). It's language agnostic, so do 20 or so of the prompts with whatever language you're most familiar with (sounds like php, maybe?). Do some with JavaScript. Make them look nice and matchy matchy too. Then, do them again - but with Vue. If you're confident with all the general webdev concepts - it should be pretty easy to get used to. Watching too many tutorials will be slower and probably create bad mental models. So, I'd try to just use the docs at first. Then after you feel pretty good with that, if you need to - then you can do those same ones with React. After that / maybe watch some netnija for some quick full-stack nuxt/next things if you think that suites your goal / but also - maybe your idea job doesn't use this stuff.\n\nAnyway. That's what I'd do.\n\nAlso +1 to u/latro666 's comments and suggestions",

They might be focused on learning some single framework, but lack your in depth knowledge about how to make websites without using sledgehammers for beating in screws. 95% of the websites jumping on the hype train of React have no actually good use case for that stuff. Lots of junior frontend devs straight outta the bootcamps know React, but don't actually know the basics, HTML, CSS, JS and any server side language well.\n\nWordpress and PHP might not be the hottest tech, that much is true. I would recommend brushing up basics with what is now possible in HTML (new elements and semantic elements) CSS (all the life improvements that have come to CSS over the last couple of years and how to use them) and perhaps JS (what you can use now, instead of reaching for JQuery and friends). Then I would probably advise to look at a solid web framework. Say perhaps Django or so. Something that will not disappear any time soon. If you are worried about some web components hype, no worries, you can do that from inside a traditional web framework easily, without having to develop every single page on your website that way.\n\nBy all means, if you want to peddle the same hyped React stuff, that so many others are peddling, even if not for tech reasons, but for financial reasons, go ahead and learn the framework for a week or two.

I also HATE selling myself, this pressure is making me depressed.\n\nBut don't be discouraged, we have still learned to solve problems and adapted a specific kind of thinking and pragmatic approach to the Job that only comes with years of experience and this is still a highly relevant skillset that elevates you beyond simple knowledge of popular frameworks.\n\nMy advice would be: look for what you \\_want\\_ to do next and avoid looking for the same kind of ecosystem (Shopfiy) \\_only\\_ for the reason of familiarity. I know it's something I do... thinking \"man but this is what I am proficient in so I guess I will continue with it\". Because if this is your only reason you will just not get happy.\n\nSo look out for what you think is fun and engaging and has a chance to not burn you out. Look at who is hiring and what they use and then just spend a month getting familiar with the frameworks they use. You have the experience under your belt, especially if you know the basics well (which you do). You will still fall into a lot of beginner traps with newer stuff but the difference is you will identify them whilst doing so because you are experienced. So you will get on track faster and then when it comes to applying for a job you know that you come with the job experience under your belt and as well as the security to not fall into immediate pitfalls. You will be confident and you can be honest in your interviews and then you will get hired for the absolute Rock that you are.\n\nIf you are like me then you thought for a long time that you would have no problems finding a new job and that you could easily onboard into the newer stuff, but then at some point in recent years, you noticed that the Juniors from today all know stuff that you don't and that you grew disconnected and you lose that confidence bit by bit to the point that the thought of having to look for another Job that does not shoehorn you into things you don't love anymore will become one steep and high mountain to climb.\n\nMy situation is that ever since starting in my last agency I just a-voi-ded doing side projects as a hobby, and I also avoided react because I look at this shit and I just know this is not a fun library (for me). Currently, I am avoiding burnout so I told my agency I want to go half-time to refresh a bit. While this was not my aim it kind of rekindled my passion and thus in the last 2 Weeks I took a look and a liking to solid-js. I love it and it is fun. This really gave me confidence that looking for another job and trying to sell myself is not as hard as I thought.\n\nSo just take time for yourself, reflect, and then just dabble with that looks interesting to get that spark flowing again and hopefully, your confidence will find a big boost.\n\nJust remember to make your \"invisible\" skillset visible. It's more important than efficient coding.\n\nI wish you the best!",

One thing I'd recommend is always be learning, try to pick up something new at least once a month whether it's the latest on CSS or a new framework. Even taking an entry React course just to know what it's about is helpful. \n\nBut say you get laid off and now you're looking for new work, you have a lot of options. One you could focus on the management portion, I see a lot of roles for web management where you sort of manage the day to day of the marketing focused websites. The other is to focus more on development and there are lots of roles just focusing on Shopify or WordPress but I'd pick up some of the latest and greatest as well, although it might be harder to land roles like these since you don't have projects with them. But you have a great opportunity to build something ahead of time if that's the direction you want to go.\n\nOverall even if you focus on the managing end of the business, definitely keep learning even if it's just so you know what it's about. Udemy is a great place to pick some of this up quickly and you could take a past project and convert it to something 'modern' whether it be one of the JS frameworks or maybe you want to go low code with Webflow or something.",

I'm guessing too many people grow up too comfortable just expecting things to happen for them. Those first 10 years are where you were supposed build knowledge breadth. Because if not then you are the guy that has been doing this for a long time that everyone thinks should be a programmer for the DMV. Somewhere making everyone's lives worse with passionless output.\n\n  \nYou aren't going to fix that in 60 days. You were supposed to be doing it for a decade or more. Short term, if you only really know PHP and some Javascript. Go learn Laravel pronto just to expand your footprint. Build something small and put it on Github. And you need to get familiar with some cloud provider and/or Docker. Wordpress is probably the least admired and least wanted to work with mainstream stack possible according to most state of industry surveys. Why anyone would just sit on that and say \"yeah, I am only going to do this\" is basically insane if they want a successful career.  \n\n\nAll you can hope for is to build a portfolio of work that you have done if impressive enough might convince someone you might be able to learn something new despite not having taken that initiative throughout your career. Settle for a set back at some other shop that only uses WordPress doing more low hanging fruit jobs. Start your own agency. Or be ready to take time off so you can develop skills. Get an interview questions book or work on hackerrank because if you have been doing Wordpress all your career you are likely really shit at algorithms and data structures.\n\n\n\nThis advice that works out excellent for basically anyone that follows it. For the future devs. This is advice I had heard from either Joel Spolsky or Martin Oerdersky give at one point about cementing that career foundation. Think it was Joel. And it works. Maybe a way to salvage a career too. Building a good career is about passion and constantly looking for opportunity. Opportunity doesn't just magically happen and work out. You have to see it and grab it.\n\n\n\nFirst look here: [https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies-language-prof](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies-language-prof)\n\n\n\n1. Pick your segment. This is webdev so that's probably determined. It's web dev.\n\n2. Find a popular stack that perhaps you had seen an interesting project or blog on, that you know is popular. Top rankings. OP's and many others, that will be Wordpress, Laravel, or a Nodejs based framework. Django perhaps. Ruby on Rails was it for a while. .Net isn't that bad and is a basis for a broad skillset.\n\n3. Find something that is not popular but seems to be stable or trending positive in opinion. Build something with it. Even if it's just a task app or a twitter clone. People learn somewhat obscure language suddenly becomes the hottest thing they were able to walk in as experts. If you know Javascript already you could pick a small but trending framework like Svelte. It has strong admiration and desire to work with. Rust also is still buzzy and growing in web, not just embedded and systems.\n\nYears and years ago the gamble I took was Scala. Had early interest, built several small projects, took Coursera courses, and read the creator's book. Which was great for my career for a somewhat small window but it's still an instant conversation starter in an interview. The past two years, looking at the data I am doing an embedded Rust project and something in Clojure. Rust is up and trending probably more interestingly in the web dev space. Clojure, well, a number of companies in industries that don't move fast use it at their core. Large codebases in change resistant industries. There are not a lot of Clojure developers, it's a very high paying skill, and those companies still need people to work as their core staff age out of the workforce...already happening. Could be the high paying way to end my career. Maybe not. But I am ready if it is. Cobol developers certainly had their huge paycheck period maintaining the fewer and fewer systems while also being experts in migrating to other stacks.\n\nBut you are doing this step every year so eventually you land on something that you say \"this is going to be a core competency\" and you do it. You practice and keep an eye out for opportunities with it. Likely they can't find people with X years experience in new Y or obscure Z but your interest alone makes you a candidate. Otherwise you end up with just enough knowledge in enough similar tools you still can find work on your conversational knowledge on a given stack and your extensive experience in other similar tools gives everyone a warm fuzzy feeling that you can pick it up on the fly.",

                "body": "Dynamic widgets is what React was made for, so it is not surprising, that it makes changing widgets easy. However, I want to ask a couple of questions and also talk about the downsides.\n\nHow many websites truly need to be dynamic? Most websites actually are not. Most websites are like blog posts or consist of simple information pages about a business. This is the reason why not every website needs to an \"app\". By going for some traditional web framework and \"just clicking links\" to get to the next static page, one avoids a lot of React complexity. For example you will never have to update your \"router\", or update the Typescript version you use, or update things for whatever ECMA script standard you target. Those things do not exist or are inherent in nature with the traditional approach.\n\nWhen a website actually has something to do dynamically, it is still a valid question to ask how easy it is to simply do it with plain JS. Event listeners are easy. Updating some text or numeric values somewhere is easy. Displaying or hiding something is easy. For such things it would be way overblown to add another dependency. This is usually the case, when the dynamic nature of a page is limited in scope, to that very page.\n\nOne always needs to consider as well, that adding React to the mix adds a huge dependency. Usually that means choosing JS/TS. If TS, then you need to have a compile step, which you also need to configure (target which version of ECMA script etc.) and install TS as a dependency in the first place. Most people doing that also then get into all kinds of additional tooling, like a bundler and minifier and whatnot, increasing the cognitive load further. Then one needs to consider the maintenance efforts required to keep the thing up to date. I find people doing all kinds of extra work in such projects, which are not actually adding anything to the final result for the user/viewer. Like for example:\n\n* \"Oh, we need to switch to this other router!\"\n* \"We need to target a newer TS version!\"\n* \"But dependency thingamabob is not ready for TS version blub.\"\n* Working on copying a navigation from one project to another taking weeks.\n\nAll kinds of such things, that would either not exist in the first place or would be a matter of copy paste and minimal adaption with traditional web framework or even static pages.\n\nBut you mention, that you find it so much nicer not to have to submit something and reload the page. Well, in theory yes, but then you get all the downsides. Does my back button still work properly for those different views? Can I ctrl+click or middle-click that \"link\" to open in a new tab? Can I send that \"link\" to someone else to look at the page that will be displayed, if I click that \"link\"? Basically you have to ensure all the standard browser behavior still works. In reality I experience an overwhelming majority of such websites not managing this properly and therefore being broken in nature. Also a well made static pages website can be very snappy, so that page reloads do not take much time at all and almost feel like local page updates, while React websites are often made by people, who will throw in a lot more than just React and will bloat the websites, making them slow, even though the page might not reload. How often do you see a spinner animation for simplest things or even the initial page load? This is slow! With dynamic pages one shouldn't be able to see any such animations at all, everything should be super snappy. Somehow people almost always manage to F it up.\n\nThis is not necessarily React's fault. It is a kind of mindset. It is the mindset of adding dependencies, even when not needed, bloating the websites more and more. Minimalism is the virtue. If you don't have much, then there is not much to maintain either.\n\nHowever, I also want to note, that it is usually very easy with traditional web frameworks to \"make changes\" to pages. You write your template once and the template has logic to react to different data. Got 3 fields to display now? The template will render 3 instead of 2 like before. Those templating engines that are in use in almost every traditional web framework are very powerful. What they are not good at is things that _actually need to be_ web apps. Then the rerendering cycles are too cumbersome. Only that 95% of the websites that use React are not that kind of website.",

And if you aren't reading the docs on how the competitors work, your abstraction may end up being not-abstract-enough and still tied too tightly to Stripe and you've just played yourself.\n\nSo maybe only do that if you're willing to put some time reading *multiple* providers' docs and figuring out what's common/different between them?",

I also wasn’t sure how to unexpand the content, which caused me to have a mess of overlapping information. I could be really stupid, but the HR person looking at your website will probably be just as confused, if not more so.\n\nAlso, I saw that your projects are limited by the wants and needs of the client. Totally understandable. Though, it might be a good idea to display projects that are yours through and through. Maybe create a website for a fake business and be as bold as you want to be. Maybe you could make this website for a local business (use their branding, items, etc.) and when you’re done you can email them and say “hey I made this website for practice. If you like it you can have it. If not, I’ll change up the branding and items so I’m not stealing from you”. Either way, you’ll have projects in your portfolio that you feel express who you are as a developer.\n\nIf you ever need someone to look at your projects, please DM me and I’ll tell you what I see!",

But here is a clear explanation also pointing to the resources that can probably get your doubt cleared up.\n\nFirst is MongoDB site itself: [https://www.mongodb.com/why-use-mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/why-use-mongodb)\n\nWhat is MongoDB Used For and When Should I Use It?\n\nFirst thing to see here is that use it only when dealing with huge amount of data. NoSQL databases are used for Big Data Engineering since they support documents as compared to traditional SQL Relations.\n\n>The idea behind MongoDB is to eliminate (or at least minimize)relational data.  Have you considered just embedding the attendance data directly into each student record?  This is actually the preferred design pattern for MongoDB and can result in much better performance and scalability. If you truly need highly relational and normalized data, you might want to reconsider using MongoDB.\n\nThis is quoted from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8129557/can-one-make-a-relational-database-using-mongodb)! It also mentioned in DBMS books. NoSQL databases were created to get rid of relations. So if you know you'll have relations then I think you are going against the idea of MongoDB which is a huge bad practice. So as the Original Comment said for relational databases it would be a huge sacrifice to use MongoDB, if you want to use mongodb make sure to make your data is document based not relational. Because when using relations in MongoDB you're abusing the original idea!\n\nWhen the data is small it is a total waste. Why?\n\n>MongoDB expects you to have memory. Lots of memory. If you can't fit your working set in memory, you can forget about it. This is different from most relational DBs which use memory only as cache!To be more specific: MongoDB uses RAM as primary storage and \"swaps\" the unneeded parts out to disk (Mongo leaves the decision over which parts get \"swapped\" to kernel). Traditional RDBMS work the other way around - they use disk as primary storage and use RAM as caching mechanism. So in general MongoDB uses more RAM. This is not a bad thing by itself, but as a consequence \"real\" RAM consumption is difficult to predict, which can lead to serious and unexpected degradation of performance once the working set grows over the (hard to predict) limit.\n\nAbove is from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4288615/why-not-mongodb)!\n\nAs you can see it is also mentioned in MongoDB itself that it uses RAM as primary storage, this certainly is good when the data needs high speed but as data grows more and more then it creates problems. Also when the data is small MongoDB is gonna be hard on your pocket, because of the expenses it will make! This is the most worst part of MongoDB as it hits the performance hard and can get really (AND I MEAN REALLY REALLY) expensive.\n\nAside from that MongoDB does not abide to [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_(computer_science)) perfectly, since it allows for inconsistent reads which is not always good! And it only supports ACID transactions for single-document only!\n\nI hope that clears your doubts. No one here is saying that MongoDB is bad or that it is useless. And neither is anyone saying that you're wrong (I even upvoted your replies). But brother every DBMS has its own pros and cons. And I'll be honest that I agree with u/OmgImAlexis here, I have been using MongoDB since quite a long time but majorly when I talk to people and ask them why they use it, it generally because that is only thing they know as they have seen in YouTube tutorials (MERN things are hyped).\n\nSo in real life when dealing with these things we need to be very accurate in judging what we're gonna use since not choosing a correct type and DBMS can create huge problems in the future!",

Keeping a breadcrumb trail was invaluable for me as a junior, and it continues to be useful.\n\n* Write down exactly what the goal is so you aren't wandering down the wrong path or trying to solve multiple issues at once. For example: When I click this button, I expect this action, but instead I am getting this particular error.\n* Write down what you've tried so far, and what the result was. What have you googled? What have you clicked and in what order? Has it helped you narrow down the problem in any way? \n* Even if you haven't solved your problem, have you figured out how to reliably reproduce it? \n* Every time you try something to narrow down the problem, write down what you are expecting to happen. This helps you to notice patterns in your results. For example: \"If I sign in with account A and click this button I expect to see error #1.\" But instead you try it and get error #2 - write that down!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**All of this helps to do 2 things:**  \n**1. Make sure you are progressing logically and not spinning your wheels.**  \n**2. Helps to communicate with senior devs if you don't succeed on your own. They will see what you have tried, and teach you new ways to experiment and debug.**\n\nDebugging is an art. Learn to enjoy it like solving a puzzle or playing a game, try not to let it make you mad, or frustrated with yourself. \n\nAll devs have fought problems that took hours, days, weeks, even months. It is all part of the job, so have patience.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m in a “Head of Digital” role at a mid-sized company — but in practice, I’m the only technical person in a team full of editors and project managers from a traditional print publishing background.\n\nThey don’t understand what I do, and when I try to explain it, I’m met with, “it’s too technical for us.” My requests for support have been denied. So have my repeated requests for just one day working from home — even though others on the team get 1–2 days.\n\nMeanwhile, I’m expected to do everything.\n\nHere’s what I’m currently juggling — solo:\n\n\n---\n\nLive Web Projects:\n\n9 actively maintained sites, all built from the ground up — different tech stacks, different platforms, all coded by me.\n\nOne of these sites includes 70 client microsites, each with custom layouts, embedded video, content management, and API integrations — all custom built, supported, and maintained by me.\n\nCMSs include WordPress (ACF/CPTs), custom PHP/JS platforms, and Shopify.\n\nFrontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (A myriad of libraries, in GSAP). REACT.\n\nBackend: PHP, REST APIs, custom CMS logic.\n\nHosting spread across Azure, custom VPS, cPanel, and various third-party platforms.\n\nAll devops, analytics, email deliverability, plugin troubleshooting — mine.\n\n\n\n---\n\nInfrastructure & Ops:\n\nLeading a CRM overhaul using a Zoho-style platform, coordinating with external consultants and stakeholders to restructure our entire workflow.\n\nHandling our cloud migration, including discussions with multiple IT vendors to scope and quote the move.\n\nWorking with global stakeholders — all different time zones, priorities, delays, and scope creep. Constantly waiting on sign-offs or missing content while being expected to “just make it happen.”\n\n\n\n---\n\nCreative & Support:\n\nWeb Video and image editing, producing marketing assets, thumbnails, clips, and more — because we have a limited digital team, aside from Head of design who is versed only in print press.\n\nFixing Shopify storefront issues, theme bugs, payment system errors, plugin clashes.\n\nCustomer support and bug-fixing, across all platforms.\n\nWas recently criticised for not also managing the company’s 7 social media channels — on top of all of the above.\n\nOh, and line managing and upskilling 2x video editors, who are often out on shoots and also no bandwidth.\n\n\n---\n\nConditions:\n\n£59K salary.\n\n1.5-hour commute each way. One day a week I lose money after paying for childcare.\n\nAsked for 1 WFH day (others get it). Denied.\n\nNo project manager, no devs, no QA. Just me.\n\nEvery time I raise concerns, I’m told “well, you’re Head of Digital — it’s your job.”\n\n\n\n---\n\nLast week, I was pushed again for a timeline on a low-priority site redesign — even though I’m flat-out launching, maintaining, and firefighting across everything else. I explained I couldn’t commit without finalised content and approvals. I was told, again, “it’s your responsibility to provide a date.” It honestly felt insulting.\n\nI used to enjoy this work. Now I feel like I’m set up to burn out and blamed for not doing more, when I’m already doing what should be the work of an entire team.\n\nSo:\nIs £59K for this workload even remotely reasonable? Or am I just burnt out and finally hitting a breaking point?\nReally appreciate any advice, solidarity, or honest takes.",

They may not even know what's going on. Your boss is abusive. Set clear boundaries when you exit.

I held out hope for my coworkers, that they would unlock a way of understanding, if I only made myself more flexible to their needs.

We are inclined to think there is always a solution. Chances are that your good intentions will soon be perceived as irritating, self-serving, or worse - condescending. It's not fair. You want the best but will be blamed for others and this will become much clearer to you when you look back on it one day.\n\nGood luck.",

Play it through in your mind a lot. It's going to be hard, they'll try a bunch of shit to make you feel bad for asking, then they'll try to fob you off, delay, tell you \"we can't review pay until next financial year\", whatever bollocks they want to make up. \n\nThese people are not your friends, they are not good people, and they are really loving the fact that you are working for peanuts. \n\nI have had a number of hard conversations with employers about pay and conditions. Sometimes I went in sweating, obviously nervous, struggled not to shake a bit and speak clearly. But I did. And again, and again. Until now I wouldn't even think twice.  \n\nCurrently I have recently started work at a tech company where product management have taken over the tech process and started acting like dicks about everything. I get here and no one has pushed back at all. Its so sad. The tech teams are upset, they're burnt out. I just go to meetings with this management layer and  give them back what they give our teams. I'm dismissive of their concerns, I tell them they don't understand the software dev process so they don't need the details but we will be delivering features and our team managers will send the plan for sprint goals.\n\nAs an example, at the start of this year they told us that they booked a marketing campaign for Feb so we would need to deliver a release by then. I was in a few meetings about it and asked why did you do that before knowing if we would deliver on that date? You're going to waste all that money? That seems ridiculous, it sounds like you need help with project management. I can't help you with that but I think you should look into it. Happy to talk about aspirational release goals and estimates in future to avoid you making this same mistake next time.\n\nDeep down they love it. These are people who love a fight, they enjoy pushing people around and seeing it they can get what they want. If you push back they understand it and they also know that their position is precarious. They can't code, they can't build, test, release anything. All they can do to look good is try to push people around and see if it works. They also know that if they piss and moan that the tech team are spending too much time building tech then they also risk looking stupid. You can help them with looking stupid too.\n\nAnyway I'm rambling. Just.. it's time for you to get started on these people. Let me know how you go.",

I recently decided to pursue freelancing more seriously, focusing on serving non-tech businesses that need occasional development help but don't require a full-time developer.\n\n**What I've tried so far:**\n\n* Sent \\~120 personalized connection messages on LinkedIn\n* Sent \\~30 cold emails to potential clients\n* Set up a portfolio website showcasing my projects\n* Updated my LinkedIn profile to highlight freelance availability\n\nDespite these efforts over the past 2 months, I haven't managed to land my first client yet. I'm starting to wonder if my approach is flawed or if I'm targeting the wrong audience.\n\n**Questions I have:**\n\n1. For those who successfully freelance with non-tech clients, how did you land your first few clients?\n2. Is cold outreach a viable strategy, or should I be focusing elsewhere?\n3. What specific value propositions resonate best with non-tech businesses?\n4. How important was your network vs cold outreach in getting started?\n5. Did you use freelance platforms initially, or focus on direct client relationships?\n\nI have experience building enterprise applications, e-commerce sites, and custom web applications. I'm comfortable handling both technical implementation and client communication, but I'm struggling to convert that into paying opportunities.\n\nAny advice, especially from those who've been in similar positions, would be greatly appreciated!",

Take it on a platform as it is easy to get the ball rolling on a platform. Then as you grow, you'll get independent from the platform.\n\nAlso adapt to the trendy topic even though it hurts, if suddenly everyone wants to build wordpress site, your tech stack won't matter.

High effort, low reward. It can also lead to less than ideal partnerships with difficult clients. \n\ni come from a design background and transitioned to web development 15 years ago so had a network of designers and agencies referring me to their existing clients or network. Since launching my business ten years ago I've replenished this network a couple of ways.\n\nSites and directories like Awwwards and Site Inspire have often led to clients contacting me and has opened up connections with International clients. If you're more backend focused it can still be worth adding yourself to directories as other Devs may require assistance on project components that aren't in their wheelhouse.\n\nECommerce platforms also often have their own directories.\n\nLocal business events are also great for building relationships with prospective clients, designers and other developers. Face-to-face networking. Sites like Meet Up are great for this. So are events organised via LinkedIn. If you can get in front of people, shake hands, have a casual chat you're already at the top of the pile when it occurs to them they need a developer.\n\nI picked up a great client recently by going along for a Friday night drinks event for solo-business owners working in the creative industry.\n\nIf you can build a professional network, reliable work with high quality clients will follow. As a business owner though it can always be a bit nerve racking when you're not sure who will be paying you in a few months. Even when you build a solid network, it never really goes away and there will be quiet periods followed by periods of 16 hour work days. Feast or famine. Haha. Enjoy the journey and good luck.",

Lower your expectations accordingly.  Eventually though someone is going to hire you for a months-long stint and boost your earnings on the platform accordingly.  I wound up making $50k on the platform doing work solely for one client, and after that I'm in a privileged position where work just comes to me out of the blue.\n\nA caveat though is that I set my hourly rate kind of low relative to my experience ($45/hr, been doing web dev for over 10 years now, far less time on Upwork).

The other strategies can be effective, but usually require a lot of time and/or money to see results.\n\nHere's what to do:\n\n1. Cold email outreach is working well for us and our clients. It's scalable and cost-effective:\n\n* Use a b2b lead database to get email addresses of people in your target audience\n\n* Clean the list to remove bad emails (lots of tools do this)\n\n* Use a cold outreach sending platform to send emails\n\n* Keep daily send volume under 20 emails per email address\n\n* Use multiple domains & email addresses to scale up daily sends\n\n* Use unique messaging. Don't sound like every other email they get.\n\n* Test deliverability regularly, and expect (and plan for) your deliverability to go down the tube eventually. Deliverability means landing in inboxes vs spam folders. Have backup accounts ready to go when (not if) that happens. Deliverability is the hardest part of cold outreach these days.\n\n2. LinkedIn outreach / content marketing:\n\n* Use Sales Navigator to build a list of your target audience.\n\n* Send InMails to people with open profiles (it doesn't cost any credits to send InMails to people with open profiles). One bonus of InMails is that the recipient also gets an email with the content of the InMail, which means that they get a LI DM and an email into their inbox (without any worry about deliverability!). Two for one.\n\n* Engage with their posts to build relationships\n\n* Make posts to share your own content that would interest your followers. Be consistent.\n\n3. SEO & content marketing. It's a long-term play but worth it. Content marketing includes your website (for SEO), and social media. Find where your target audience hangs out (ie, what social media channels) and participate in conversations there.\n\nNo matter what lead-gen activities you do, it's all about persistence and consistency, tbh.\n\nDM me if you have any specific questions I can help with! I run a b2b outreach agency (not sure if I'm allowed to say the name without breaking a rule, but it's in my profile), so I deal with this stuff all day every day.",

Pre-made solutions are excellent value addition and can save you so much time but for learning you must start from the basics.",

That’s why I’ve been using WP, which I’ve stripped down to be easy to manage, as few plugins as possible (just ACF mostly), on a relatively cheap hosting plan.\n\nIt should also be relatively quick to spin up new sites. Most of them are basic, but some require automation, bespoke design or custom integrations. That rules out Squarespace and the likes.\n\nExcited to know what you guys are using, and why.

I build 100% custom themes using ACF. Reasons why I stopped using Craft and would not use again:\n\n1. Breaking changes in updates are not at all uncommon. \n2. Lack of ACF style functionality without plugins. Sure, you can create your own fields, but anything like a complex repeater field is going to require a plugin like Neo. Neo can make updates hellish.\n3. Conditional logic with fields is new and basic. Nothing at all like ACF. And cannot be done at all in matrix/neo/supertable fields. So no conditional logic where you need it most.\n4. Small community. Posting questions to the discord server is like screaming into a void at times.\n5. Poor documentation. Searching for anything leads you to things that worked in a previous version but require new syntax. Finding that new syntax can be a struggle.\n6. Composer. I hate composter.\n\nSadly it is WordPress for me. Until ACF just becomes its own CMS.",

I can easily create custom plugins and themes for it then lock shit down easily for client use purposes. \n\nDrupal is something that's has been widely requested by universities and schools. For some reason it became a standard at some point for a lot of places. I personally love Drupal myself and wish I had the opportunity to do more with it. Back in the earlier 00s I experimented a lot with it on personal projects and it's quite wonderful. \n\nI recently did a couple projects on \"Big Conmerce\" which I don't recommend, but the clients wanted to use them.

They also have amazing customer support and I use surprised to find out a shit load of huge clients like BMW and BlackDiamond.

It's my first ever web app so feedback will be greatly appreciated.\n\n**What is Dear Stranger?**\n\nDear Stranger is about letting people send anonymous letters to be answered by absolutely anyone in the world! You can use it to share an idea, tell a joke, confess secrets, or really whatever it is you want to say. (As long as it's not offensive)\n\n**Why was it made?**\n\nI made this app because I wanted to get into web development, and I had this website idea for quite a while. I came up with the idea of Dear Stranger after I realized that there's really no place you can dump some idea and get a response about it. Technically you could just message random people on any social media platform, but no one would reply, and they can't reply anonymously. Thus, Dear Stranger was born.\n\n**How to use it?**\n\nTo write letters, just log in and start typing. To respond to letters, the same. Simple as that.You can optionally select a country to let those who read your letters / responses to know where you are from! When your letter recieves a response, you will recieve an email to let you know.\n\n**How was it built?**\n\nThe web app is hosted on Vercel and is built with NextJS, a React framework. It uses PandaCSS as the CSS component framework. For the backend, it uses the Prisma ORM to connect and send requests to an AWS RDS Database running PostgreSQL. It also uses NextAuth to handle User Authentication and nodemailer to send emails.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI got some comments pointing out it as not truly anonymous, and I agree and I'm sorry for not being clear about it as I didn't realize the implications of having a sign in.\n\nYou do have to log in because I was afraid of bot spam and malicious users, and I wanted a way to keep track of writers and responders. The only ones who can see the letters is just me, so when you are writing a letter, do keep that in mind moving forward. If you are still uncomfortable with that, then I understand.\n\nIf you have any idea on how you could better implement this anonymous messaging system, please do share with me!\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nu/___Nazgul has shared a better way of implementing \"shadow users\" to make it truly anonymous while preventing spam. So I thought I should give them a mention as thanks. Will work on this feature and will repost again once it's TRULY anonymous :D\n\nEDIT 3:\n\nMy post has blown up way more than I could've imagined, and thanks to the tremendous amount of feedback, I've managed to add some features since I've posted this:\n\n\\- A post/response limit (5 letters/responses an hour)\n\n\\- UI fixes particularly in mobile\n\nThanks again to those who support my app. It's given me a lot more motivation to work on it!\n\nHere are the features I will be working on to improve my app:\n\n\\- A better way to handle users (via anonymous users with option to sign in)\n\n\\- A filter to automatically remove spam/abusive content\n\nIf you'd like to help out, feel free to contact me, and my code is open-source, so feel free to check it out and contribute!\n\n[https://github.com/seanmic1/dear-stranger](https://github.com/seanmic1/dear-stranger)",

These fields wouldn't be required, but if a bot fills them out, especially common ones like \"website\" or similar, you could reject their requests. I'm confident that there are packages available to help combat spam without compromising the anonymity of the app. You can also employ other spam prevention measures, such as a reliable CAPTCHA solution. However, it's important to note that you won't catch every bot, especially the pesky human-controlled ones that aren't technically bots themselves. This is something to keep in mind for the future of your application. Your app is great, and you've nailed the concept, but there's always room for improvement, particularly in terms of privacy and security 😊",

                "body": "I just assumed that the messages from other users are stored in the database as plain text. If this is not the case, then you can forget my comment.\n\nhttps protects against man in the middle attacks or that sent messages are changed. However, https only applies between client and server. The server itself can see the message as plain text. That makes sense. After all, you have to be able to do something with it. So, it protects against programs like Wireshark.\n\nFor end-to-end encryption, the data must already be encrypted on the client side before the message is forwarded to the server.\n\nThe encryption does **not** take place on the server side.\n\nThis means that your database would then only contain encrypted messages. You can't read them anymore and protect the privacy of your users in case your database gets hacked.\n\nEvery active user on your server needs a public and private key. You can think of the public key as an open lock, which you can use to encrypt texts. This key is stored in your database. The private key must remain on the client side and must not go to the server. For this you use cookies. If this cookie is lost, all messages are lost as well. Works, as far as I know, the same way as with WhatsApp, which is why you lose your chat history when you reset your phone because you lose the private key.\n\nAs I said. It is easier for the user to simply lose their messages if they think they need to delete their cookies. Of course, the user-friendliness suffers for this.\n\nBut now the problem is that an asymmetric encryption (public/private key) can only encrypt short messages. That's why it is actually used to exchange a symmetric key (both users have the same key). These are only stored locally).\n\nI think, it should be enough if you just use an asymmetric method like RSA. You'll have to find out for yourself how exactly you want to do this.\n\nOne way to ensure that the user cannot lose his private key would be to use a password. This means that the private key is generated using a password and is therefore always the same. In this regard, look at the whitepaper I linked. There it should be detailed how to store the data persistently despite end-to-end encryption.\n\nIt's definitely not that easy if you've never had anything to do with it before. But the links should help. \n\nAlso remember that stored passwords are not encrypted, but hashed and salted. Also make it obvious that this generates the private key and therefore the password cannot be changed easily. But I think it would be theoretically possible if you just re-encrypt all messages. As I said, just play around with it in a test environment. Something like this is not done overnight.\n\nMake a plan how you want to implement the whole thing while you are playing around with it. Should help when it comes to the nitty gritty.\n\nSource / some nice links:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQDCe585Lnc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQDCe585Lnc) (Visual explanation of how symmetric and asymmetric encryption works)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2aueocJE8Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2aueocJE8Q) (A little more detail, about symmetric and asymmetric encryption)\n\n[https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/HTTPS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/HTTPS) (How HTTPS works)\n\n[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-RSA-and-AES-GCM-encryption-Why-does-the-speed-of-encryption-vary-so-much-depending-on-the-machine-you-test-it-on-Is-there-a-universal-answer-for-this-question](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-RSA-and-AES-GCM-encryption-Why-does-the-speed-of-encryption-vary-so-much-depending-on-the-machine-you-test-it-on-Is-there-a-universal-answer-for-this-question) (difference between RSA and AES-GCM encryption)\n\n[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/generateKey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/generateKey) (How to generate a key)\n\n[https://dev.to/jrgould/use-the-web-crypto-api-to-generate-a-public-private-key-pair-for-end-to-end-asymmetric-cryptography-on-the-web-2mpe](https://dev.to/jrgould/use-the-web-crypto-api-to-generate-a-public-private-key-pair-for-end-to-end-asymmetric-cryptography-on-the-web-2mpe) (How to generate a key)\n\n[https://davidmyers.dev/blog/a-practical-guide-to-the-web-cryptography-api](https://davidmyers.dev/blog/a-practical-guide-to-the-web-cryptography-api) (How to generate a key, encrypt and decrypt data)\n\n[https://onboardbase.com/blog/rsa-encryption-decryption/](https://onboardbase.com/blog/rsa-encryption-decryption/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20big%20problem%20with,secrets%2C%20keys%2C%20and%20credentials) (How to use RSA in python.

None of this changes the fact that refusing to elaborate on TOS violations is well-established best practice.\n\nAs an example on the other side, if the company has reason to believe that CC fraud is involved, then telling you that your account is closed and not mentioning CC in any way is absolutely the right move, 100% of the time.

If they use it, then the account just gets banned, I'd be smart enough to think I got caught if I was using a stolen CC. Do we really think scammers are that stupid and fall for that obscurity? If that card failed, why didn't DO look at all the other accounts to see if that card was used and ban all other accounts with it on file? CC Lookup exist in merchant accounts. \n\nA singular failure should not kill your account especially if you know you get false positives. Multiple failures should trigger it. Like when scammers try to use a few  different cards in a row and they all get rejected. Credit cards are already insured, so this really only hurts legitimate users. Scammers just move onto the next card when something gets blocked/banned. This is just shit customer service and corporate policies not security. Issues like this can happen simply due to how your merchant is set up. For example heavy throttling settings can trigger it. As could something like changing the zip code for the card but not updating it in the account if zip verification is mandatory. Or a ton of other configurations can cause false positives.

        "title": "Best freelance sites for developers starting out",
        "author": "psaiful28",
        "id": "y38tf4",
        "selftext": "I’ve seen lots of people complaining about UpWork without providing better alternatives, and thought I’d create a summary of the pros and cons of each platform that I’ve used/use. Let me know which sites/subreddits/communities you’ve used and I can add them to the list. As the current r/UpWork alternatives list doesn’t have much detail, please include key reasons why you’d recommend/not recommend each site.\n\nDon’t restrict yourself to one platform, *especially* if you’re just starting out. Certain freelancing sites are going to be better for beginners, and others for more established freelancers, but you’re generally best off casting a wide net when starting out and seeing where you get the best results.\n\n# Upwork\n\n**Pros**\n\nThey’re the biggest platform by far, with a huge number of developers, designers, writers etc., primarily from lower CoL countries. UpWork is the archetype of a “network effect,” where its success has essentially been built around buying up the competition to create a feedback loop of growing bigger *because* it’s the biggest. The sheer volume of jobs on UpWork makes it easier to get jobs if you’re willing to work for cheap to get experience.\n\n**Cons**\n\nUnfortunately that size also means you’re competing against extremely low rates bid by freelancers in lower CoL countries, and a tendency towards bullshitting credentials/work experience.\n\nOn the employer side, Upwork’s size also means there are more employers that aren’t serious/will simply ghost you altogether part way through the process. There’s also the chicken-and-egg problem of getting employers to hire/even consider your applications when you don’t already have reviews, which most of your competition will have/fake. Finally, they limit the number of bids on jobs you can make and charge you if you go over that. When you’re starting out with no reviews, it’s extremely difficult to get jobs with the limited number of bids they give you.\n\n# TopTal / “Premium” Services\n\nFull disclosure: a friend of mine worked for TopTal as a web dev (mostly backend stuff). I haven’t personally used it as the hiring process/setup didn’t fit what I was looking for.\n\n**Pros**\n\nThey command very high rates, but if you’re getting hired at TopTal you’re not a “beginner” (friend had a Bachelor’s in CS and 3 years of full time work at a mid-tier dev shop). You set your hourly rate (guided by them) and then they charge that rate plus a significant markup (approximately double what you earn) in exchange for getting you clients. TopTal has a wide range of freelance roles, including engineering/development, project/product management, design, and finance.\n\n**Cons**\n\nTopTal is very restrictive in that you’re required to do all client work through the platform, can’t be hired by a client full time without the client paying TopTal a massive buyout fee, and lose a huge cut of fees to TopTal. From what I’ve heard if you can get TopTal you should just apply for a full-time role at a company and get paid much more, as TopTal doesn’t really have the flexibility that IMO makes freelancing attractive.\n\nIf you *really* hate negotiating your rates, TopTal handles that for you in setting a clear minimum for their clients, but you can do the same by just listing your rates on your profiles elsewhere. Because the process is led by TopTal salespeople, they are pretty restrictive about what kind of jobs you can list. For example, their marketing roles are very limited. If you have a specific role you like doing and plan to stick to just that role, it can be a good place to get high-paying work.\n\n# Fiverr / “gig” sites\n\nFiverr reverses the job posting process of sites like UpWork, by having workers list their services and clients search for and book them. If you have no portfolio work, Fiverr can be worth trying out as a way to get some. Just check into your niche by searching for it and seeing what others are offering and at what rates.\n\n**Pros**\n\nThe advantage of Fiverr/gig sites over standard freelancing sites is that you can list your services on a marketplace that employers search, rather than actively bidding on each job posting made by employers. Reviews are still a big part of it, and the fees are even more exorbitant, but you can at least avoid the grind of applying to dozens of jobs like you would on UpWork. It also means you’re not paying to bid on jobs like you do on UpWork/Freelancer. If you’re in certain niches where the work is primarily single, clearly defined projects, gigs are well suited to this (e.g. making infographics, even stuff like logos) but this generally isn’t the case for development work.\n\n**Cons**\n\nThey take a massive cut of your earnings (20%), charge 5.5% on top of that to your buyer, and don’t let you move work off Fiverr, so it’s much better suited to short term projects than finding higher end/longer term clients. Like Upwork, Fiverr tends towards a “race to the bottom” on rates and arguably quality as well, meaning clients tend to be worse.\n\n# Contra / zero-fee freelance sites\n\n**Pros**\n\nTheir cut of your earnings is zero, saving you \\~20% off the bat from UpWork/Fiverr. Your profile becomes an interactive CV where employers can see your past work, the people you’ve worked with, services and rates all in one place. It’s basically a free portfolio site that also lets employers book your services, and because there are no fees you actually want to link them to it. This also means you can have initial clients found through your network book you through Contra to get specific project experience future employers can see, without paying 20%+ for the privilege.\n\n**Cons**\n\nIt’s freelancer oriented, meaning you can’t post Fiverr-style gigs that employers can easily browse. Because the employers are mostly US based, English speaking/writing skills are important. $25/hour minimum on jobs means your competition is generally more skilled than other marketplaces. Because of that competition and the site’s focus on portfolios, you’ll want to have at least some portfolio work to stand out.\n\n# Reddit\n\nThere are a bunch of subreddits dedicated to freelancing and job posts, including r/slavelabour (for truly low rate work where you’re purely looking to build your portfolio), r/forhire (where you can post what you do, links to your portfolio etc.) I wasn’t on Reddit enough to try these before I had already found clients elsewhere, but you don’t lose anything by posting there and including links to your portfolio(s).\n\n**TL;DR:** Unless you’re in a low COL country and have 0 portfolio work, avoid the cesspool of low rate competition, ghosting employers, and competition from freelancers with fake reviews on UpWork/Guru/Freelancer.com. If you have *some* work you can show on your portfolio, I recommend setting up a Contra profile to showcase it and get initial work. Together with GitHub, this will give you a portfolio to attract the kind of projects/employers you actually want. If you have *nothing*, bite the bullet and work on personal projects while bidding on low rate stuff on UpWork/Fiverr to build out your portfolio on Contra/GitHub/Behance.\n\nBiggest sites: UpWork, Freelancer.\n\nHigh-rate sites: TopTal\n\nZero-fees: Contra\n\nZero-fee networking: r/ForHire, LinkedIn, GitHub",

I'm thinking of using Express and PostgreSQL for the backend, whereas my friend will be using either React or Vue for the frontend and Swift/Kotlin for the mobile app.\n\nIs Express the right choice in this situation? It's the only backend framework I've worked with in the past and can't afford learning another framework like Spring Boot, .NET, etc. because of the time constraint. Basically, musicians will be able to sign up and log in to the website, and when they log in, all their data from various music platforms (Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) will be fetched to be shown in their account. The company, on the other hand, will be able to easily manage their musicians on the platform (think of it like a CRUD management system)",

Move on to session cookies and encrypting cookies, as well as hashing passwords. Make sure you understand the difference between hashing and encryption. At this point you can build your own rudimentary authentication system.\n3. Learn about JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which is a common format to write session cookies in. At this point you can write some basic production-ready authentication schemes.\n\nIf you have fundamental understanding of these technologies, you can go on to learn OAuth so you can implement logins through other providers like Google, Facebook, Discord, etc.",

It might allow you to develop the core functionality quickly, giving you more time to focus on specific features and integrations.\n\nOf course, the best tool depends on your specific requirements and team expertise. If you're interested, I'd be happy to provide more information or resources on Frappe. \n\nGood luck with your project!",

But that's still an insane amount of adoption for a blanket \"no.\" Django is only 4M weekly, Fastify is 1.7M, and others barely make the chart in relative terms.

I was referred by another subreddit to post here instead.   \n  \nI hope we have some backend devs here? I am currently in the process of integrating an email service into our microservice for our SaaS. This service will handle all the essential email-related functionality required for a backend system to support our user base effectively.\n\nThe specific requirements for the email service include:\n\n1. **Welcome Email**: Sending a personalized welcome email to users upon signing up.\n2. **Password Reset**: Allowing users to reset their password by receiving a secure link or code via email.\n3. **Subscription Invoice**: Automatically sending an invoice or receipt email to users after every successful purchase or subscription renewal.\n4. **Newsletter**: Potentially sending periodic newsletters to users (maybe).\n5. **Inviting Colleagues**: Enabling users to invite their colleagues or team members via email, with customizable invite links or messages.\n\nThe application will cater to around **10,000 to 20,000 active users**, and the estimated email volume is over **100,000 emails per month**. Therefore, the service needs to be **reliable, scalable**, and capable of handling transactional emails efficiently, along with offering a user-friendly API for integration.\n\nThese are the providers I researched but I have no clue which ones to go with:\n\n|**#**|**Provider**|**Details**|**Price**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|1|Nodemailer|A Node.js module that enables applications to send emails easily|Free|\n|2|Sendgrid|A cloud-based service offering reliable email delivery at scale, including APIs for integration and tools for marketing campaigns|Free - up to 100 emails per day $19.95 - 50,000 emails $89.95 - 2,500,0000 emails Custom|\n|3|Postmark|A service focused on fast and reliable delivery of transactional emails, providing both SMTP and API options|$15 - 10,000 per month $115 - 125,000 $455- 700,000|\n|4|Novu|An open-source notification infrastructure for developers and product teams, supporting multiple channels like in-app, email, push, and chat|Free- 30k events $250 - 250k events + $1.20 per 1,000 additional events Custom|\n|5|Resend|A service designed for developers to deliver transactional and marketing emails at scale, offering a simple and elegant interface|$0- 3,000 emails/month|\n|6|Resend community wrapper|A NestJS provider for sending emails using Resend, facilitating integration within NestJS applications|Free- 3,000 emails/ month $20- 50,000 emails/ month $90- 100,000 emails/ month Custom|\n|7|Brevo|An all-in-one platform for managing customer relationships via email, SMS, chat, and more, formerly known as Sendinblue|Free- 100 contacts $9- 500 contacts $17- 1,500 contacts $29- 20,000 contacts $39- 40,000 contacts $55- 60,000 contacts $69- 100,000 contacts|\n|8|Fastmail|A service providing fast, private email hosting for individuals and businesses, with features like calendars and contacts|$5- 1 inbox $8- 2 inbox $11- up to 6 inbox|\n|9|Mailgun|A transactional email API service for developers, enabling sending, receiving, and tracking emails at any scale|Free- 100 emails per day $15- emails per month $35- 50,000 per month $90- 100,000 per month|\n\nI’m evaluating these providers based on their pricing, scalability, and the ability to meet the above requirements. I am thinking maybe nodemailer because it is free but I am just afraid that this will go straight to spam.\n\nWhat have you used in the past, what would you recommend based on your experience and why? I would appreciate your input.",

But in the recent months I've made it into a full cross-platform suite:\n\n* ✅ Web Client (WASM)\n* ✅ Browser Extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Edge & Safari made with React and WXT\n* ✅ Native iOS App (Face ID, Autofill) using React Native and Turbo Native modules\n* ✅ **Brand new** Android App — *just launched today on Google Play!*\n\n[New Android App in Google Play, compatible with both cloud and self-hosted AliasVault](https://preview.redd.it/3invtzwlm44f1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a79b09f949b52515c0fc83285e579c88cdf60f22)\n\nAliasVault is fully open source (AGPLv3), self-hostable via Docker, and actively maintained. Feel free to check out the repo and try it out yourself! :-)\n\n🧪 GitHub: [https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault](https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault)  \n📱 Website: [https://www.aliasvault.net](https://www.aliasvault.net)  \n📚 Docs: [https://docs.aliasvault.net](https://docs.aliasvault.net)\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed, tested, gave feedback, or just starred the repo!

It features a built-in identity generator (first name, last name, birth date etc.) and more uniquely: a built-in email server with encrypted email storage, allowing you to create a unique private email address for every service you use. All of this without any third party dependencies and a focus on user friendliness.\n\nIt’s fully self-hostable too, including the email server setup. It comes with an installation script that takes care of everything, you’re up and running in literally 5 minutes. It’s more light weight compared to Bitwarden as you can run AliasVault even on a Raspberry Pi with as little as 1GB of ram.\n\nMy vision for the future is to add more privacy related features to the AliasVault platform, such as integrating disposable mobile phone numbers right into the core as well. Also AliasVault will focus more on individuals & families as opposed to enterprise, which Bitwarden is marketed to.\n\nFor full disclosure: I do think Bitwarden is a good option as it’s open source too. But I also believe having (more) alternatives in the password manager space is always a good thing, so people can have a choice.",

We are about to start v3 of our app and we've all decide next version we are getting out of that environment.\n\nThe first iteration was like the wild-wild-west where we were learning the tool and what code we did write was kind of all over the place.\n\nV2 we took things we learned and standardized how things are done for instance button handlers, state, computed properties, and it's still a mess.\n\nWhere it all fails\n\n* Code reviews are hard. The files to review a slew of just yaml files and it makes it difficult to see the developers intent. Multi-dev is a mess. We are always fighting merge conflicts and resolving those in a yaml file is absolutely painful. I would rather spend a few hours and recreate what I did than try and resolve the conflict\n* It lacks a good testing framework for both unit and E2E. The SaaS behind the tool has tried several times to deliver a way to write tests and it's never worked out. We've had several things break that simple tests would have caught. Our users lack confidence in the tool and my dev team pray each release didn't introduce a bug.\n* High learning curve. Learning the tool is pretty easy, having someone new come in and learn the codebase is very difficult. \n* There's often more than one way to do something so without a standardized way to accomplish a task it can lead to a mess that's hard to follow and understand\n\nWhere it shines\n\n* Simple UI's, or wiring up a component to a REST API is waay faster and easier\n* UI designs and mock ups are more interactive and often lead to re-use in the final component\n* Our product team can build simple things to show us what they envision\n* It is faster to get certain features out the door\n\n\n\n I think overall tools like these do have their use cases the problem is the business doesn't seem to understand that. If you want a simple dashboard, a form, or a config tool then a low/no-code could be the right way to go but it's important to know the limitations of what you are building and when to stop and migrate out of a low/no-code solution. Thankfully I think our product team has realized we've grown beyond the capabilities of our tool and sounds like for V3 we'll be back to using Vue or React with a backend. \n\nWould I use them again? Sure, but only for the right things. We may use it for V3 but it would probably just be for an admin area or a configuration tool that integrates with what we build outside of it.",

They are now deciding *what problem to solve.*\n\nBut that is an entirely different job. It fundamentally relates to the theory of the business. The executives are doing this, not the developers. Or at least, they think they are.\n\nSo what ends up happening in reality is that you get immediate friction between executives and developers if they haven't picked the right low code solution - and by the way - there never is one.\n\nEDIT: I wanted to add, if low-code worked, you wouldn't need developers. How to abstract a real world problem is the hard part. It doesn't matter if it's python, or c++, or assembly, the hard part is figuring out how to abstract it. There's actually nothing inherently easier about a low code solution, because the hard part is still the hard part.

I've seen $150k, $350k custom web apps completely abandoned in a month because the end-users refused to learn a new process that takes an extra 20 minutes out of their day. Anything that inconvenience a user is already in a losing proposition. The perceived so-call benefits of adopting a new workflow is hard to overcome. Many see very little net-gain.\n\nA no-code solution like the one I describe, they do nothing else. They already add records to an existing spreadsheet on a fileserver. Now, everything else is done for them in the background. That is a powerful concept to grasp and I have not seen one good rebuttal to it. Is it perfect? No, but I've seen it cover 90% of corporate workflow use cases. In my example, vendors don't even need to get onboarded (ask for new logins to a shiny 6 figure web app).",

It takes some creativity, and often a mix of lots of database or obscure serialization format inspection, and I've had to resort to writing a custom parser or code generator a couple times, but I actually find it a lot of fun. The biggest problem is that someone who used one of those solutions has to be pretty motivated to migrate off by the time they actually go for it, so they often set deadlines against contract and license expirations rather than against time estimates from engineering. My enjoyment probably comes from my inquisitive desire to know how things work and my background in cybersecurity where you have to put a lot of things together that someone has tried to obscure.\n\nThat said, I've seen a lot of migration in both directions. Some companies just can't manage a robust engineering team. Those systems might be better for them. Lots of low margin companies only pay enough for junior developers and will never have long tenure.\n\nThose systems are doozy though. It takes a lot of money to leave them, and by that point, you have probably been using it far outside its intended purpose or scale.\n\nI don't think in the next 10 years we will low code replace software engineers.

After nearly a decade of stepping into a role where I was required to learn WordPress, among other things (I do a lot of custom CSS tweaks, PHP snippets, and the like) I got an email last week from someone in the company who has zero say in that part of the business, stating that “the decision has been made to move to SquareSpace” and are essentially giving our Marketing person the reigns, to do a complete redesign, etc., stating that moving to a new platform is in our favor for “modernizing” and “ease of managing” the site.  \n  \nI want to fight this transition with every ounce of my being, because SquareSpace seems to be extremely limiting. We have an issue with content-generation at the very least, and my guess is someone thinks it’s too hard to post things, or do whatever they are wanting to do. But like this transition, none of this stuff has been mentioned prior.  \n  \nMy questions: what do I have working FOR me in terms of continuing to use WordPress? Aside from the fact that I’ve learned it quite thoroughly and am comfortable with almost every aspect of it, what can I tell them? Aside from training on the platform from content management (because it may be difficult to a new user), I can’t think of one reason why we would move to SquareSpace.  \n  \nApologies if this post is all over the place, it’s been a long week of preparing for the meeting and questioning what I know.

It's not a good sign exactly that they haven't consulted you at all, but given how you propose the problem here I doubt it would have been of much use either. Do not come to this as \"we must use wordpress\" standpoint. But actually listen and try to address things which concern you from business side and on top of that, as an addition, you can mention what bothers you as a professional regarding the possible change. And maybe wordpress will turn out to be the correct decision and it may not. But it's important to move where the evaluation leads and keep personal preferences to a minimum.\n\nAnd it might also important to note that if all you've used to is wordpress your perspective might be quite limited as well. And you may not be able to make a sound judgement on the topic.\n\nAnd lastly, your job, as a professional is to deliver value to the business. Not to see business as a vehicle to satisfy your own needs. Sure, any good relationship is reciprocal. To get value, you need to give value. They are hiring you to solve their problems, not yours. And if that cannot be set up in reciprocal manner, when you can think about changing jobs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not the answer you were looking for I guess. But that's what I recommend. Don't come to the meeting with idea \"I must convince them to use x\". But as a professional who helps the organization to achieve it's goals. As one should. If the return for that is not up to your liking, when think switching jobs to a place which will be better aligned with what would satisfy you.",

                "body": "I agree that now’s probably a good time to update your resume…\n\nAs someone who has been hired to build both SS and WP pages I can hopefully give you a few talking points.\n\n1. Customization - WP as you know is open source with nearly infinite plug-in options. SS is controlled by one profit-focused company with limited, ( sometimes overpriced ) plug-in options.\n\nOften, the only solution for necessary customization (a specific layout, or any JS) is writing JS/HTML/CSS from scratch and pasting that into a “custom code” box. This requires a “business” level subscription payment, by the way.\n\nExample: I’ve had one site lose all images after a weird JS update from SS. I spent an hour talking to clueless customer service, asking at minimum for at least information on what had recently changed. Their reply essentially: huh, we should keep track of changes shouldn’t we? We’ll pass that idea onto the team.\n\nI fixed it on my own after a few hours of troubleshooting, then updating custom code boxes. Their code editor is awful by the way, it lags and sometimes moves the cursor while you’re typing.\n\n2. Performance - I’m not a fan of Wordpress by the way, but I assume if you’re an expert in it, you’ll be able optimize performance pretty well. SS doesn’t allow much tweaking in this area, and customer service is trained to tell you that Pagespeed scores are not valid for all site types, and SS shouldn’t be judged by that metric.\n\nWhile it’s true Pagespeed Insights isn’t an all-knowing god here, it does show SS sites using an unwieldy amount of JS that you have no control over.\n\n3. Customer service - If they find any trace of custom code, they will try to pin problems on that and avoid troubleshooting issues that originate from their end. Been there. I wouldn’t call their customer service an upside. Not sure how easy it will be to find advanced, 3rd-party paid help in SS, I assume not too easy.\n\n4. Scalability - being forced to work in “code blocks” limits you to pasting snippets on each page. ( You can paste in the <head> too, using a very narrow text editor ) I’ve gotten around this by using a separate CMS to manage some content, and putting a cdn link inside the code block. This is more sustainable and allows me to make site-wide changes. It’s crazy to use a CMS in a CMS ( this level of crazy comes from my client that refuses to leave SS, due to sunken cost fallacy before I was onboarded :’) ).\n\n5 - Version 7.0 is probably not the answer - This previous version of SS is still running and allowed developers to edit template files, for full customization. I’ve spent several days trying to learn this, and while searching everywhere, could not find a good enough tutorial to really get me going.\n\nDocumentation wasn’t detailed enough for me either. Maybe someone with more experience in templating languages can pick it up, I didn’t have enough time to keep trying. Also, again no support is available when customizing, and I doubt it will be easy to hire 3rd-party support for this deprecated system. They do keep v7.0 sites running of course, but they’re heavily pushing the next version v7.1, which made me feel uneasy while putting time into v7.0.\n\nSummary - SS is advertised as a DIY platform for hobbyists and startups. It’s fine for that. If you don’t need precise control over CSS, and you’re fine with the limited plug-in options, it will be ok. If your business ever requires something more, you’ll be stuck fighting sunken cost fallacy too :) Good luck.",

I am unsure how much is easily transferable to squarespace. But they probably haven't researched that enough either. I would make sure at the meeting they know how it would look before and after the switch and make a trial/ dev environment for the current environment and one singular update on square. If they were happy with this then you could drop WordPress subscription. If they don't agree to that I would do what most people say and update the resume.

Our app is a single page application, for which ReactRouter works amazingly well.\n\nWe use NextJS more for the building and we have another route for docs and it helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe use Firebase function with Node.js to listen to events, send emails, doing checkout and payments with PayPal (you can roll your own gateway)\n\nUsually, your functions will be the least invoked component of your commerce app.\n\nWe pat Google few cents per month just for keeping the functions in their cloud.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope I answered, but if I wasn't clear, please ask more",

        "selftext": "Don't get me wrong, tutorials are important when you are first starting your web development journey. They should not be where/how you build the majority of your projects from.\n\nThis took me a long time to realize, I thought hiring managers and recruiters would find these projects interesting enough to give me a shot... I was very wrong.\n\nThis realization is what got me out of tutorial hell, I realized that re-building an already made product that showcased no effective problem-solving skills of my own was going to get me no where.\n\nAs someone who was in tutorial hell myself for a long time, I know how hard it is to think of what to build; it seems like everything that has a chance of being successful is already built.\n\nWhat I found best to building a successful project was fulfilling these requirements:\n\n1. I needed to be passionate enough to finish the project\n2. It needed to serve a particular unpopular niche to have the best chance with establishing presence for SEO to eventually have organic growth.\n\nWhat I landed on was a platform, similar to dribbble, where developers could easily find images from developers portfolios for inspiration.\n\nThis was:\n\n✅ Something I was passionate about\n\n✅ Serving a purpose within a particular untouched niche\n\nUnfortunately, at the end I was left with a project with no users (of course) like a lot of projects we make. So I decided to take a leap and do what is known as \"building in public\".\n\nI made an X account, started to find users apart of the niche and directly messaged them about my project. This did not work at first as everyone's always a little skeptical being the first user on a new website.\n\nAs I continued to publicly market my product on X, I decided to find ways to market my product directly to users email inboxes.\n\nWhere I struck gold was finding this GitHub repository: [https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios)\n\nThis single repository got me my first 20+ users that helped establish the foundation of my site.\n\nThe repository is filled with developers who uploaded their portfolio link, along with their name, to be publicly showcased. This was my niche served to me with no fluff.\n\nThe approach I took was sincere when emailing users from this repository, clearly stating how I came across their email address, and portfolio site and why I thought they would be interested in my site.\n\nWithin the email, I also included positive feedback I had from their site as I did have to browse it to find their email address.\n\nFrom this, I was then able to continue \"building in public\" with a decent enough level of success by eventually getting 80+ users and about 20k monthly visitors for my first month after launching my project.",

        "selftext": "Hello friends,\n\nI have a pretty long question about building a complete website solo. If you’d rather keep scrolling, no worries, but if you’re willing to help, thank you so much for your time!\n\nI’m going to build a website for someone I know. It’s the first time I’ll be doing this (semi-)professionally, and I’d love to get some advice upfront on how to set things up as a solo developer. So I don’t run into too many problems when i'm halfway done and I will need to start over.\n\nPreviously, I’ve made basic websites and shops using WordPress, Elementor, and WooCommerce. Since then, I’ve taken full-stack web development courses, and I now feel comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and React. I also know how to build simple backend functionality, but I feel like I should avoid building things from scratch, especially for things like shop systems and instead rely on existing tools or platforms.\nThat said, my issue with WordPress and its plugins is that many of them require monthly subscriptions, which I’d really like to avoid. For example, I don’t want to use Elementor anymore because it’s quite limited without the pro version, and I have the skills to build the layout/design myself anyway.\n\nSo here’s my main question:\nWhat stack/setup would you recommend for building a site like this on my own, using some coding, avoiding subscriptions, and still keeping things manageable? \n\nThe website should include:\n- A basic main/home page\n- A small shop page (selling books)\n- A page to book courses (probably similar to a shop page)\n- A page with free downloadable resources\n- Detailed pages about each course\n- English & German translations (this feels like it might be the most difficult part)\n- A responsive design (I know how to do this with plain CSS, but any tools I use should also support it)\n",

You'll have to host this somewhere, a VPS in Hetzner or DigitalOcean should do. \n\nAbout design, you'll have to roll your own. Maybe ask the client for references of 2-3 pages that do the same and that they like.\n\nAs this is your first time, estimate how long it will take you, then triple it.\n\nIf I were you, tho, I'd just so it in Shopify.",

Okay, how about a guest cart. Forgot password functionality. Slow API calls. Uploading images. Adding reviews. All headaches that are a pita!\n\n\nWordPress is so awful and such a pita and has terrible performance, really doesn't do you any favors. It might make one thing easier, then makes 5 other things insanely painful (ie having to make 2 sequential api calls just to get a user's data because you need data fetched from the first call to access the 2nd just to display their username, nevermind more useful data like order history, or the fact only admins can see certain data so you need to create a custom php plugin so users can just... Do basic things).\n\n\nDoable, but ends up being more work when the hope is it'd be less. I've done it. Custom building was so much easier with something like graphql. Literally every simple thing is just a massive keyboard smasher besides inputting products into the database, which honestly will not be hard to create custom on your own. You can create custom wordpress plugins with php fairly easily I suppose, but then what's the point over just using a custom CMS you build.\n\n\nUsing next and ssr/ssg helps makes things really responsive and fast and great for SEO which you'll want with an ecommerce site. App routing, ssg, isr, dynamic routing, internal vs external API calls, you'll have to learn but otherwise it's just built in top of react with some quirky folder structure as the means for routing.\n\n\nTailwind is easy for styling, you can plug in components with easyfrontend so quickly or go more in depth with something like shadcn, or a mix.\n\n\nSubscriptions, maybe deployment on AWS but their first instance is free I think? Custom DNS, shouldnt cost much...\n\n\nStripe API for payments, that pretty much handled security and the like.\n\n\nAnyways it sounds like a headless backend might be the easy route. Trust me, it's not. Either fully utilize an ecommerce package like Shopify or woocmmerce, or go custom. Don't try to make a react site that uses an ecommerce backend. Besides you really should use next, not just react. So so much better and professional.",

Billing the client for time you spent reading documentation for something you decided to use probably isn't okay.\n* Think about the client experience, if they're going to be dealing with orders, creating new products, setting availability for courses and uploaded content these all need to be easy. You may also need to do some training/write documentation to help them.\n* Maintenance, who's doing the updates, how is it being charged. \n\nBased on what you've said I personally would go the WordPress/WooCommerce route with [Bricks Builder](https://bricksbuilder.io/) and a plugin for multi language. I'd integrate a third party service like Calendly for the booking whilst you could do this inside WordPress I haven't found any plugins with a good end user experience (particularly on mobile)\n\nThe reason I'd suggest Bricks is that its a visual builder that puts you much closer to the CSS. Functionally it just gives you a GUI for changing CSS properties and it lets you create classes and variables to your hearts content. You can quite happily setup a design system for typography, spacing, colour palettes and layouts to speed up development and keep things consistent.",

        "selftext": "Just wanted to share a recent experience. I built a huge management platform for a national healthcare provider a year ago. It was great at launch, but over time, they accumulated hundreds of thousands of rows, if not millions, of data per DB table. Some queries were taking many seconds to complete. All the tables had unique indexes on their IDs, but that was it. I went in and examined all the queries' WHERE clauses and turned most of the columns I found into indexes.  \n\n\nThe queries that were taking seconds are now down to .2 MS. Some of the queries experienced a 2,000% increase in speed. I've never in my life noticed such a speed improvement from a simple change. Insertion barely took a hit -- nothing noticeable at all.  \n\n\nHopefully this helps someone experiencing a similar problem!",

        "title": "AMA + An insider's review of the highest paying freelance platforms",
        "author": "CriticDanger",
        "id": "pnu4aj",
        "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nI'm in the unique position of having used many different platforms for freelance work, and I've been accepted in many of the more premium/exclusive ones as well. In this post I'll review the best three I've used so far, which are Toptal, BrainTrust and 10xManagement. I've also used Upwork, Freelancer, Elance and Fiverr both as an employee and employer.\n\nWhy are those three the best? For **experienced** freelancers (they all require experience and are very hard to get accepted into), these platforms will give you the best clients, which means the best wages and the best projects. All three are also very professional and will support their talent better than a low-end freelance site. Not to say they are perfect, all of them have issues, but they're better than the current alternatives.\n\nLet's go!\n\n# [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#bring-in-incredible-hackers-now)\n\nToptal is the biggest one of those three (maybe the biggest premium platform overall) and has the most jobs, by far. It is the most well-known of the three, and as such, they are in a dominant position in this market and they know it, so they can charge higher fees for example.\n\nThey are a typical marketplace in which, once approved, you get to see all the listings and apply to them. Because you've already been technically vetted by Toptal, clients usually won't test you, and the interviews are mostly to check communication and fit.\n\n### Jobs\n\nAt this moment, there are [127 jobs](https://i.imgur.com/y8r7W87.png) that have been added within the last 7 days. This doesn't include jobs that require a specialization, if you include those, then it's over 150. These are serious clients that had to put in a deposit to create a job posting.\n\nIf your goal is to get hired as fast as possible, Toptal wins out here, and there is also a good diversity of contracts.\n\nThe quality of the jobs/employers vary, you can find a contract with Airbnb on there or you can find a contract with a small startup. Overall, there is a minimum standard, and you won't find a truly terrible/broke client on there, clients are vetted and must put down a deposit.\n\n### Rates\n\nExpect between $40-100/h for the vast majority (90%+) of roles. \n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/XBtEVd4.png) is a chart directly from Toptal that shows what a client is expected to pay per hour for their talent. If these numbers look higher than what I wrote above, that's because the talent doesn't see those rates.\n\nIn Toptal, the neither client nor the talent know each other's rate, the talent sets his own rate and the client will see the talent's rate with the Toptal fee already added on top. This varies, but generally the Toptal fee is about 50% (!) of the talent rate, so if your rate is $60, the client might pay 80-100/h for you. \n\n\n### Joining Toptal\n\nIt is pretty difficult to get accepted in Toptal, there are five steps in the interview process and some require good algorithmic knowledge, others require a lot of free time. They get hundreds of applicants per day because of how well-known the platform is.\n\nTo join, simply go [here](https://www.toptal.com/#bring-in-incredible-hackers-now) and sign up, you'll be contacted for the first step of the interview in a bit.\n\nThe first step is a simple interview to test your English and communication skills. Next, they’ll send you a codility test to complete. If you pass that, you’ll get a technical interview with an engineer, who might ask algorithmic type questions as well. After that, you’ll have a take home project to complete, and a final interview demonstrating the project you’ve built.\n\n# [Braintrust](https://www.usebraintrust.com/join-engineer?utm_source=talent&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=dc_ref)\n\nBraintrust is the newest one here. It was founded in 2018 but it's only really starting to pick up in popularity recently. The overall process overall is fairly similar to Toptal, you go through an interview process, and once approved, you apply to positions.\n\nThey are already working with large companies such as NASA, Porsche, Deloitte, Nike etc.\n\nOne interesting quirk of Braintrust is that they are trying to make the platform more \"decentralized\", and \"talent-owned\". They have their own crypto (btrst) which launched recently, and btrst holders will be able to vote on proposals to the platform (governance), theoretically even important things like modifying the fees could be voted upon.\n\n### Jobs\n\nAt this moment there are 40 jobs in the last 7 days. Most are development jobs, but there are also jobs for Product Management, Project Management, Designers and more, same as Toptal. There are also jobs that don’t fit into those buckets, such a communications manager, copywriter and such, so it’s still worth considering for non-traditional remote roles.\n\nThe jobs are very competitive so it’s difficult to get hired. The clients are high quality and there are a lot of approved Freelancers, some whom are very good, so you need to really stand out. I expect the balance to change soon as the platform aims to onboard more clients.\n\n\n\n### Rates\n\nThe rates at Braintrust are pretty good. Braintrust only takes 10% from the client and 0% from the talent, so you nearly get the rate the client pays. The vast majority of roles pay between 50-150/h, although there are some outliers on both sides.\n\n### Joining Braintrust\n\nSimply sign up [here](https://www.usebraintrust.com/join-engineer?utm_source=talent&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=dc_ref). You’ll enter a waiting list before getting interviewed. Fill out your profile as much as you can as it might accelerate the time it takes you to get an interview.\n\nThe waiting list is pretty short at the moment but that might change as the network might gain a lot of publicity soon.\n\nAs for the process itself, it’s a fairly simple one, there is an initial screening call in which your communication skills will be evaluated, a second stage in which you’ll be asked to complete a coding challenge and a third stage which is the behavioral and technical interview. The interviews are not challenging per say, however, Braintrust is very selective and thus you need your communication and technical skills to be on point.\n\n# [10x Management](https://10xmanagement.com/)\n\nThis one is a little bit more secretive, but it is nonetheless a very good option for highly skilled freelancers and possibly the one with the highest rates overall.\n\nThe owners used to manage music talented and pivoted to manage tech talent, in a similar manner, and they’ve done so pretty successfully. For their permanent talent, they somewhat “guarantee” that they’ll find you work full-time or part-time, as they would with entertainment talent, and for that reason they have very few engineers whom are very highly qualified. If they are representing you, they will also do as much as they can to ensure you get paid by the client, up to assisting in legal matters.\n\nThey are not a marketplace per say like the other two, you don’t have access to the list of all positions, a 10x agent will contact you directly when they have an opportunity for you and you get to either accept or refuse an interview with the client for that position.\n\n### Jobs\n\nDue to the nature of how they work, I can’t really know how many jobs they have available, I can only know about the ones they contact me for, or sometimes they’ll ask everyone for a job that is specifically difficult to fill. My guess is they likely don’t have too many openings at a time, maybe 10-30, but they do have a lot of talent working on long-term engagement.\n\nIf you manage to become officially represented by 10x, they would generally find you enough opportunities to fill your time, but getting represented as such is very difficult. They have A-tier customers as well, such as BMW, Berkeley, Ebay, Nordstrom, Yelp etc.\n\nHowever, they are moving away from that model somewhat and most of the new talent instead gets a non-exclusive contract, in which they can work on other projects too and 10x doesn’t guarantee to fill their time.\n\n### Rates\n\nThe rates at 10x are the highest of all 3 and generally start at around 175/h. If you’re a super specialist or you have very impressive experience, you can sometimes double or even triple that. It’s also possible to get a lower rate than that, although anything under 100 would be pretty much unheard of. As for the fees, they are charged to the talent and are generally about 15% for represented individuals, and 25% for the non-exclusive folks. \n\n### Joining 10x Management\n\nJoining 10x is close to impossible. They make that very obvious as they don’t even have a form to apply as talent. Essentially, they’ll be the ones reaching out to you if you’re a truly great engineer or you’re very well known.\n\nThat’s probably pretty disappointing reading this after I tell you about their amazing clients and rates...but well… there may be another way. As 10x comes from entertainment talent management, they view relationships as extremely important. So essentially, if you want to get in, you need to both be talented and know someone on the inside that can refer you and vouch for you. Check your linked in contacts properly (build them if you have a poor network), maybe you already know someone that’s part of the network..\n\nAs for the process to join the network one you’re in the pipeline, it’s a fairly simple process, you’ll have a call with the founder to ensure you have the right communication style (communication is the most important thing in 10x), and if that goes well, you’ll have another interview with an engineer. If that goes well, then you’re in, and you’ll start getting emails once in a while for potential gigs.\n\n=========\n\n# Ending words\n\nThere you have it. If you’ve got some experience under your belt and/or a good portfolio, give a shot to a few of these, and if you get rejected the first time, try again in 6 months. None of these platforms will reject you “permanently”, unless you do something stupid, keep studying and working hard and apply again later. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments!\n\nEdit: It's late but Ill answer questions tomorrow too.",

You have to negotiate aggressively to get more amenable terms.\n * The BTRUST token seems more like a gimmick rather than an actual way of controlling the platform (i.e. \"send us referalls and we'll give you 100BTRUST instead of cash....\")\n * If your portfolio isn't banging, it will take you a very long time to land new work on Braintrust.\n * They just took 10M$ in investment money, and that's likely going to force them to commoditize their labor too quickly.\n * You don't have much leverage with the jobs -- they're high-paying staff augmentation mostly (not strategic hires), and clients can choose to exit the relationship at the drop of a hat.\n\nThe good:\n\n * The team there is actually genuinely interested in helping you succeed(financial incentives are aligned).\n * The clients are legitimate and have healthy budgets to spend.\n * Some of the highest payouts Ive ever received have come from Braintrust.\n * The application process is quite simple (they don't waste days of your time like Toptal).\n\n***\n\nOverall, it's a great platform, just really hard to get into / get the most out of if you're inexperienced. \n\nIf you're already established (and have the portfolio to prove it), then you'll do well on Braintrust.  It's kind of like a \"rich get richer\" type deal.",

I just finished my 12th interview two months ago.\n\nEvery interview is with a different person, so you are forced to rush through your “story” faster & faster everytime, while none of them care. Some will even try to finish your story for you by guessing & move on to the next part. \n\n7/12 interviewers were very entitled & I even got shamed for not using DreamWeaver by interviewer 4. (The entitlement could be based upon the receiver, me, so I won’t elaborate.)\n\n9/12 interviewers, their primary language was not English. So communicating was difficult & industry standard terms were never used. A lot of slang terms that were definitely local to their language, that tried to be translated into English but didn’t make sense. \n\nExample: I was asked what my stack was & I assumed what code stack. Nope, they wanted to know my preferred IDE.\n\nCutting off sentences, never letting full explanation happen and never fully listening. It felt like the people you interview with just do back to back interviews all day long & it’s just a rush job.\n\nYou get algorithm tests all the time. I interviewed for being a UI/UX Developer & it was algorithms in JavaScript. I got through it, thanks to a JavaScript algorithm GitHub repo, but it was really hard. \n\nYou’re always given project you can’t finish, which they warn you & tell you about, but it is daunting since you’re never really able to show off any skills. \n\nThey aren’t always looking for non-senior level developers. My 8th interview, I was warned that this is taking so long because they are primarily looking for “Senior Quality Developers.” Yet I still go pushed onto the 9th interview??\n\nThere is no personalization with the interviews. You’re just a number on the grand scheme of things & it’s all just rush rush rush & speeding through everything. \n\nOverall I got accepted into TopTal after my 12th interview, but it was a 6 month long process. I ended up finding a fulltime job locally & turning down Toptal, then deleting my account. \n\nI wouldn’t touch that site with a 20ft pole now. What a headache & stressful process. In the whole process I ended up getting my first two clients on UpWork & finishing them to put on my portfolio & get a job locally.",

Develop Object Oriented Programming, .NET Core and ASP.NET server apps. Use Web API to add RESTful endpoints. Add and consume Docker containers for RabbitMQ, Redis and SQL. Employ Typescript and React for client-side web apps; Axios, Fetch and Ajax for server-side calls and parse JSON responses; CSS and SASS for branding. Create Azure DevOps pipelines and tasks to build, release, and test .NET, NPM, Docker build, Automation and API tests, and deploy to PR sites. Apply SOLID principles, use DDD to model the business domain, support RDM, and integrate apps in the .NET ecosystem. Develop loosely coupled components with dependency Injection. Create middleware for cross-cutting features of logging, error handling, validations, and auth. Scale containers with Kubernetes. Employ Zustand for state management, ESLint and Prettier for code quality, React Profiler to identify and fix bottlenecks, RPP and HOC design patterns, and Webpack to optimize production builds. Migrate products from CRA to Vite to boost module optimization and support HMR. Use NextJS and SSR to enhance SEO, SSG to pre-render webpages as static assets, and Azure Data Factory to consolidate data and feed it into Azure Blob. Implement and maintain SQL databases, and Redis cache clusters. Write SQL queries and Stored Procedures. Manage MongoDB databases. Retrieve data with GraphQL. Create C# Linq queries with joins and grouping clauses to filter and sort data. Implement encryption with standardized algorithms. Monitor database and clusters’ health and stability. Deliver end-to-end tested software solutions. Employ Jest and ViTest for client-side testing. Add unit tests for server-side components. Use Selenium for UI automation tests. Generate .NET SDKs with NSWAG to expose APIs to other products and for API testing. Generate custom SDKs with client authentication to remove security vulnerabilities. Use Cake to build JS SDKs for mobile apps. Calculate cycle time and track tasks with TargetProcess. Query Azure Application Insights logs to debug defects. Set up, configure, and assign Azure Web App resources. Implement authentication services. Use OAuth 2.0 and OIDC to enable SSO and allow secure API access, ADFS tokens and claims-based authentication to verify user identities and grant approved access, and Identity Provider OKTA to implement MFA and to assess permissions allotted to user sessions. Maintain security and compliance requirements. Monitor and block security threats in real-time. Implement NIST cybersecurity framework. Use Google Analytics and Gainsight to track users’ activity. Use Elasticsearch for full-text search. Write DSL queries for filtering. Develop reindexing processes for migration and database restructures. Scale indices to keep up with data loads. Develop interfaces to interact with AWS hosted zones and DNS records. Build mechanisms to disallow association of hosted zones with more than one domain to prevent route conflicts, record overwriting and keep SSL certificates valid. Mentor and coach team members, identify and suggest fixes for technical errors, performance setbacks and non-standard code. Run planning meetings.\nRequirements: \nBachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Information Technology or a related field.\nTwo years of experience in analysis, design, development, and testing software solutions to include:\nAgile development practices and Object Oriented software development.\nC#, .NET Core, ASP.NET, MVC, Web API and Docker.\nSource Control Management with Git.\nSQL Server, Stored Procedures and Entity Framework.\nDatabase management with Mongo DB.\nRabbitMQ.\nRedis Cache.\nUnit testing and writing testable code.

It usually goes: You would ask them how they plan to deploy. They have no idea what you're talking about. You tell them you can handle that for a fee. You include additional line items on your invoice for deployment.

I'd rather leave that to the support team of a hosting provider. I set everything up for clients on their chosen hosting platform (that I usually recommended). Part of the handover was the credentials to any accounts I had created for them (with prior written approval), including their new GitHub account with their repo containing their source code (copyrights to source code were included in my price, because I didn't care about those personally).\n\nAt this point you can walk away entirely when the project ends.

If you want to have easier maintainability, it is best to keep both projects on the same server. For instance your company is a software house and has a lot of different brands, then the best way for this specific case is to focus on maintainability. But if you are a SaaS provider that uses microservices architecture then keeping it separated may be the ideal way to handle. For instance you can see some websites having \"example.com\" and their api as a subdomain like \"api.example.com\", this is an instance use case of a separated server, as it can help mitigate the workload off.\n\nFor database it also depends, but I personally would go with [https://neon.tech/](https://neon.tech/) because of db branching being one of the most important feature for my specific use case as it allows production db migration easier with very minimal to no downtime at all. You can stick with a simple vps + postgres for the cheapest solution but it is not managed, if you want managed db then DigitalOcean Managed databases or AWS RDS is your best solution",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm seeking advices from professionals already in the field regarding pricing and other aspects of a project.\n\nI'm currently attempting to launch a small web development, design, and process digitalization business with a friend, and we may have found our first client. After our initial contact and reviewing the issues with the current site, I created a quick mockup of the homepage on Figma, developed a basic brand identity guideline (used for the mockup), and prepared an initial customer survey for the project's continuation.\n\nThe primary goal was to capture the client's attention and assess her interest in our work. It was successful, and she has requested an appointment to discuss further.\n\nThe challenge is that I lack experience with pricing in this field, and I want to avoid deterring her with the cost (especially since we need this first project to build our portfolio). Please note that this is in France (and in a small remote island at that), where pricing may differ from regions like the USA.\n\nThe project involves a basic website with 6 to 7 pages and limited functionalities—just some forms, a blog like feature, and maybe an interactive appoitment manager. In my initial plan, I estimated around 160 hours of work for :\n\n* The discovery phase\n* The interactive mockups on Figma (descktop and mobile)\n* A complete brand identity guideline\n* Development using Laravel\n* The back office (for the blog, the appointments, and potential future feature expansions)\n* Testing and deployment\n\n(I'm still uncertain about other details, such as database work, hosting, or advanced SEO.)\n\nThe project would, as for now, probably follow a somewhat classic validation process : Discovery → Wireframes → Mockups → Dev → Testing. I also thought about opening a Trello in order for the client to follow the progress of the work in real time.\n\nI calculated the cost at approximately €30/hour, totaling €4,800. I considered offering a package deal at around €4,000–€4,500, but honestly, seeing the prices people charge on platforms like Fiverr has made me somewhat anxious.\n\nDo you think this is a reasonable price for a first project or should I consider lowering it (and do you have some general advices) ?",

                "body": "Few thoughts here:\n\n- How did you calculate the hourly price? Charging 30€ per hour while 2 people working on the project is too low in my eyes. What is both your targeted wage? Does 30€/hour align with what you need to make per hour to generate NET income? When I started freelance, I charged 75€/hour since I knew i wouldn't have a consistent/regular source of income for a while, and needed to account for that times too, as well as taxes.\n- In your calculations also consider what costs occur during development for software, plans, etc.\n- 160 hours in total also feel a little too tight. Consindering a \"normal\" working day of 8 hours, that results in just 20 working days. If you can work in parallel, thats 10 days for each of you - seems unrealistic for the offered services. I would calculate at least 10 days for design alone (equals 80 hours) - that is NOT including any kind of organisation and administration (e. g. meetings and calls with the client, presentations, writing emails, documentation, etc.). For development, after a few years of experience in both freelance and corporate, it always worked out pretty fine for me assuming that development roughly takes three times as much as design (in this case resulting in 240 hours) \n- You could do finer calculation when you know beforehand how many individual components there probably are, creat your \"base expense\" (e. g. 8 hours) and then multiply them by factors of difficulty (e. g.  1x, 1.75x, 3x).\n- Instead of a fixed total price, you could offer a semi-flexible plan: Charge a fixed budget, but explicitly note in the contract, what tasks are included in this budget. For anything else you ADDITIONALLY charge your hourly rate. It is however important though, that in this setting you clearly have to communicate whenever you're charging \"off budget\" and how long you estimate this additional work to take.\n\nEDIT 1: fixed some typos\n\nEDIT 2: I forgot to mention from personal experience:\nMy first freelance gig was a Onepager for a Personal Coach. Designed from scratch for one mobile screen and one desktop screen. Authored content via locally hosted Strapi, which then is build into a statics website.\nThe total working hours eventually added up to 140 hours.",

Since the client wants to at least post articles (it's a consulting firm), the appointment manager should also be dynamic and reflect what's in the database, and the back office is also there for them to easily post and manage everything.\n\nAs for the hosting, I'm unsure. I'm still unaware of what they're using rn and if they want to change that.\n\nA yearly contract is indeed a great and common practice. I considered following that idea, but I was unsure about how much I should charge. Maybe offering the site for €2,500 and charging €100/month for maintenance and security?",

                "body": "Please absolutely take your side (or maybe even main) jobs into account, especially when your client asks for a rough time frame when to expect deliveries. Building a business is time consuming and most certainly you'll find yourself torn between conflicting deadlines and obligations of your side jobs, tbat may negatively affect not only the time that you could work on this project but also your motivation. I started freelancing as a side business too and it got me mentally exhausted real quick. I'm not saying go all in or don't even try, I can only advocate to not underestimate to keep two balls in the air.\n\nIncorporating costs comes down to a pretty basic formula:\n- Is an expense client-specific? Are these costs directly and solely related to the project? Fully include it in the invoice\n- Are there expenses for subscriptions or software, that you use for the client, but not exclusively? Dive the costs by 60 and multiply it by the estimated time frame of the project.\n- Are there (repeating) expenses that are necessary to run the business itself (e. g. Internet provider, mail service, stationery, rent, electricity,...)? Sum up all these costs and divide it by 30 to get a \"daily average cost\" and again multiply that by the estimated time frame.\nThis way you can pretty much settle on your target wage too. \"Simply\" sum up all the fixed costs that you have for rent, groceries, leisure and retirement investment. Divide the sum by 30 to get your average and thats your starting ground. From there you add up taxes, health insurance costs, these \"business costs\", factor in times when there's no clients (thus, no revenue) coming in, generate capital, etc.\nAlso, don't undersell your expertise, it may communicate \"we're beginners\" and can undermine your actual skill level. Having too low rates has cost me a few projects where the clients thought I'm not aware or capable of the complexity that THEY thought they have.\n\nFor starters I definitly recommend going into the conversation with more time and be very transparent about it, no matter if the price is directly correlated to the actual hours worked or not. You can settle on less time still, when the client thinks of it as being too much. If you're not financially dependent on the job, you can definitly go with your gut feeling and recap later if you made ends meet or if you lost money from the deal. Those are eventually the best learning experiences, let me tell you that :D\n\nYeah, the difficulty multiplier is actually a neat estimation trick. Once you have a good feeling for the size of a project type (e. g. a simple blog, Onepager, eCommerce, etc.), you have re-occuring components, modules and functuonalities (following an atomic design) and can basically put a count on these (e. g. 10 components, 20 components, 50 components,...).\nFor the difficulty multiplier you then say 50% of these are easy/straightforward , 30% medium and 20% complex/difficult (standard fibonacci sequence) or however you see the distribution fit. In my company where I'm employed at (I quit full time freelancing for that position) we go with that estimation when working on an agency pitch and haven't been provided with exhaustive details.\n\nSound plan! Having revisions on a regular basis is absolutely necessary even more early in your business. You also should think about how you track your working process together with your client (for example with a ticket system, accessible for both of you) and how often you'll sit together just to talk about how it's going. It may seem repetitive and potentially annoying after a while, but I found it to be highly beneficial to have frequent and set dates to address hindrances or disturbances. Everything is fine and can be solved as long as it is openly communicated.\n\nRegarding the contract: I'm no lawyer and what you legally need to put in there is dependant of your country as well as your businesses legal status. If you have some budget to spare, look for a lawyer specializing in freelancers and have her/him help you (I highly recommend booking a session just for taxes and all the legal stuff too) and wether you are contracting a finished product or a service. There's plenty of templates that you can refer to as a start, nonetheless you should invest some money to have a lawyer \"validate\" it from a legal standpoint. I'm not saying (nor wishing) for things to go south, but when they do, it gets ugly so bad so fast - so better safe than sorry.",

Considering that it's our first project, I chose to take the minimum. The idea is to scale up progressively with each project we deliver. As for the targeted wage, it's not really set right now. We both have another job on the side, and the goal for now is mainly to find clients and build a portfolio (to hopefully grow enough that we can both dedicate the majority of our time to development).\n* For now, we don't have expenses in this regard. We don't possess a Figma Pro account, and we still have access to the entirety of the Adobe suite for free from an earlier training we participated in. But, to be honest, I don't really know how to incorporate those costs into our estimates. I've often heard that we should also include the price of our internet connection, hardware expenses, and such, but it still seems kind of nebulous to me.\n* You're entirely right on that. My co-worker also thought that I was considerably underestimating the time we needed to properly deliver, especially because I'm the only one doing programming. Our division of labor is that I'm somewhat a full-stack developer while my co-worker manages the design. I'll strongly consider the 240 hours, but as I stated, I'm really afraid of deterring the client. It's a small consulting firm, and I'm not sure that they're ready to \"gamble\" this kind of money on junior freelance developers.\n* I didn't think about incorporating a difficulty multiplier. It's a rather nice idea ! And yeah, as you said, we still need more info to properly assess everything. But I still wanted to have a rough idea of what I could present to the client on the matter.\n* It's indeed an interesting idea. My plan was to provide a rough estimate and revise the time at each validation phase. As for the price, for the reasons stated above, I'm hesitant to reflect the additional time at a 1:1 ratio. Maybe plan a 50% hourly fee for any additional time spent on the project ?\n* Really good to know about your first experience and the time it took you. I'll keep that in mind !\n\nWould you also happen to have some recommendations for the maintenance contract ?",

It has a Github integration, SSL auto-provisioning, team accounts, etc. You just have to bring a generic Kubernetes cluster, that almost every infrastructure provider supports very cheaply these days (cheapest I've found is $4 for 2GB of memory on Hetzner)\n\nThis lets you take advantage of a ton of things that Kubernetes does really well, like automatic healthchecks, zero downtime deployments, auto scaling, etc, while also making it easy to use for solo developers or small teams.\n\nThe additional benefit of Kubernetes is that it's also possible to host a bunch of other stuff in your cluster via Helm charts, that you’d normally have to pay for like:\n\n* Sentry\n* Wordpress\n* Metabase\n* Dagster\n* Airflow\n* MongoDB\n* Redis\n* PostgreSQL\n* … And basically every single open source tool under the sun\n\nI've been hacking around on random projects like [Reframe](https://reframe.canine.sh/) and [Whiteboarder](https://whiteboard.canine.sh/) for myself, and deploying it with Canine and been really happy with it so I figured it was worth a shot sharing it.\n\nI’ve had a hard time communicating the value of this relative to other stuff out there like Coolify, Dokku, etc, to others in the past.

You could go managed but it's much more expensive and I wouldn't do that unless it was for business purposes.\n\n> Environment Configuration: When moving to production, should I maintain the development setup and create separate Docker environments for production, or should I replace the development configuration (e.g., .env files, build flags, service settings) with production-specific instances?  \n\nDev and production should ideally be as close to eachother as possible, but for dev you will obviously need extra tooling.  You probably want separate containers for production.  \n\n> if there are standard tools or platforms you'd recommend (e.g., Docker Compose for production, reverse proxy setup with Nginx or Traefik, SSL configuration, CI/CD pipelines, etc.), I’d love your input on those as well.  \n\nUse Cloudflare for an initial reverse proxy.  They have a lot of nice services.  For further reverse proxying inside your own network I would say Caddy is the easiest to use at the cost of throughput.  \n\nGitlab has CICD built-in so if you're able to switch it may be helpful.  \n\nDocker-compse is fine for prod on a small scale like yours seems to be.  No need to complicate it.",

The main requirements are: client booking management, invoice issuance and tracking, pending payment control, and basic performance statistics for the employees using the system.\n\nI've got web dev knowledge, so I could totally build this from scratch using any of the popular stacks. But honestly, that would eat up a ton of time and cost, making the project unfeasible right now.\n\nI've been doing some research, and my current options are:\n\n* **Strapi** for the backend, then building the frontend from scratch.\n* **WordPress** with some plugins + customization.\n* **Odoo** (I don't quite grasp what it does, so I'm unsure about this option).\n\nMy big question is, does anyone know of a platform that covers most of these needs natively, or are there robust options out there that allow for good customization and extension with custom modules? I'm really looking for something that can grow with the company.\n\nAny recommendations based on your experience? All input is super appreciated!",

You don’t necessarily need to write PHP, but it’s helpful if you want more control. Plus obviously it offers hosting \n\nIf you're considering using another technology that would need a CMS like Strapi or a similar headless CMS, the setup is a bit different. For example, with Strapi, the content is typically managed by developers, whereas WordPress allows non-developers to edit content more easily. Also, keep in mind that Strapi doesn’t include hosting — it’s just the CMS backend.\n\nIf you’re looking for something that handles both the CMS and hosting, **Payload CMS** is a solid alternative.

        "author": "koevh",
        "id": "1f8yotn",
        "selftext": "Hey all, I've been a frontend freelancer on and off for the past 3 years now, but I still feel like a junior. I couldn't land a job anywhere, so I tried freelancing in the meantime.\n\nI started co-working with one guy who has a company (let's call him S), but is totally tech clueless. No experience in anything IT or web dev. But he has good sale skills and was able to find me (us) clients. Ofc, he moves part of the income to his company. There's no contract or anything between us, it's purely on a trust base (I'm that desperate). It's working pretty much. Until it's not.\n\nWe landed this client who wanted a job platform. Of course I knew it will take a lot, but the scope creep is insane. Being the junior that I am, I don't know how to organize, prepare, even do basic research. The graphic designer (another freelancer who attached to this guy) - also a junior, did a half-assed, but pretty enough design (enough for the company owner to approve it) that was hard to convert to code (inconsistent fonts, margins, paddings, no grid layouts, my blood still boils thinking about it). No mobile version as well. NOTHING about research or data model that I found out immediately that I need.\n\nIn the meantime, I found out about Payload and that's been a godsend. It does a lot of the heavy-lifting backend-wise and has good enough out of the box authentication. I worked day and night (a few times haven't slept more than 30 hours). In the meantime the client pressures us to deliver. We're now 4 months after the promised deadline by S. IT'S ONLY ME and S keeps promising and bullshitting them that we're a team at 'our' company and that 'we' are working on it. I can't handle the meetings when I'm the only one talking really, S has no clue about the project he's trying to sell, and I'm screaming internally when he tries to suck up to the client by promising more features. I ALWAYS discuss it with him later that 'who do you think is going to have to do this?'. But I can't stand for myself really or probably I'm not communicating well enough, because so far I always ended up doing more stuff than what was initially planned. And here's the problem - pretty much nothing was set in stone from the beginning.\n\nNow finally, when the web is somewhat functional, the client decided to start testing it. And of course it breaks on many places, because I didn't have the time to test it. I'm currently working on a payment solution, which would mean that I need to set up some logic with orders/memberships/organizations and jobs, write custom hooks to manage all of that, then improve job creation. I can do it. I already did so much, but I'm tired.\n\nThe kicker? I'm getting 1600 EUR for that. For more than 4 months of my time. I was kind of motivated before to finish it, but now I'm the mood to absolutely say 'fuck this' and just not deliver. Fuck S and \\*slightly\\* fuck off to the client. This is not my first client ofc and I've had worse. And I've had better, but once every few months. This one is quite reasonable all things considered, but I'm just tired.\n\nWould you (rage) quit or you'd finish it? Is this what it's like to work in web dev? I dreamed of being a freelancer, but now I think I prefer 9 to 5...\n\nBtw, if you're curious, here's a beta version: [https://schooljob-beta.coolify.koev.cz/](https://schooljob-beta.coolify.koev.cz/) you can register and check it out (also need to find a way to implement registration confirmation tokens). It's in Czech, I have the English version set up with i18n, but need to find a way how to impement the routing for it. A lot of basic features are still missing, so be kind please. Or not. :D",

With the expected behavior of a job platform - each organization creates and manages jobs, and can manage applications to those jobs by registered candidates or anonymous applicants. The feature for creating a job was my personal hell - integrating Zod + Lexical Editor and React Hook Form. I don't want to do this again. :D\n\n- Email functionality (a lot of events are covered) with email templates that the admin can edit\n\n- Internalization\n\n- Subscription management, paywall and newsletter\n\nAnd really many, many more stuff around those same points. While it should make sense to the final user, the amount of research on HOW the platform should work that I had to do was quite a lot (and took quite a lot of time from my time for development). I had half of that in the design, but I had no provided plan. The client of course didn't know what they wanted as well, unless they 'see it'. Which means that everything now is biting me in the ass, because NOW they're deciding to test it and ask for changes. There were random texts in the footer in the design, just to fill space, random stuff everywhere that lead to nowhere. The mobile responsiveness was done purely in code and just 'whatever looks best' with what I could do.\n\nSomething I'm quite proud of that I got to learn how it's done, is using SSG + ISR. Every job and organization page is a static page and updates on-demand if the organization or admin updates it. This makes the website go brrr.\n\nThere's a lot more stuff to do as well. There's been essentially no testing done, I don't feel confident about emails and authentication. No security checks anywhere.

For me it's important to show dedication to learn and some sort of progression curve of what you've been through. Like thing you've picked up on. If I see you learn quickly and have done a few projects (be it professionally or personally) where you pick a couple of points like: ran into edge cases that you solved, or, ran into a problem and solved it in a certain way.

        "selftext": "Hey, \n\nInitially we created our own auth solution but have been meaning to move over to a 3rd party provider for a while now. And I've just started looking more seriously at Auth0. Initially I really liked it but I'm starting to realise that they might want to charge us in the range of $3-$5k a month which is a bit too expensive I think. So I'm curious what other alternatives we should consider.\n\nOur current setup is a React frontend that registers and authenticates through a Kotlin/Java Backend that we control. We are in the 10-100k MAU user range which will hopefully continue to grow other the next few years. And we are in an area that deals with relatively sensitive data (As well as some fraud) so having an Auth provider that helps us combat that would be nice. \n\nSome thing that I liked from Auth0 That would be good to have in an alternative:\n\n* Ability to do a trickle migration of existing users (when a new user logs in Auth0 would send a request to our old auth service and then from there take over that user on subsequent logins)\n\n* Handles Duplicate users logging in (e.g if a User has both an Email and Facebook account under same email it would handle merging them.)\n\n* 2FA And login/suspicious behaviour protection. \n\n* Support for B2B single sign on things like Okta etc. \n\n* Seems like a pretty good dashboard to manage users, manage role based access controls, multiple different projects etc. \n\nIn addition to all the obvious things of hopefully having a pretty straight forward integration, good documentation, likely to be future proof in terms of upcoming features, supporting misc social platforms etc. \n\nOur servers are hosted on GCP so I think AWS Cognito is out. I see Firebase has some connection to Google so that might be worth considering haven't dug that deep into it but it seems to be slightly more hands off than Auth0? (or maybe Firebase is part of a bigger stack integrated into other different features, not just handling Auth?) \n\nAnyway theres a bunch of different providers but it feels hard to evaluate how well each of them fit to our specific use case, so any input is much appreciated.",

It may not provide all the features like trickle migration or B2B SSO out of the box, but there are a lot of resources/docs for that. Should work well with your existing GCP infrastructure. This would be my first option I take a closer look into.  \n\n\nOkta looks great as well and seams to fit your needs, but the pricing is pretty crazy at first glance ($3 per user per month?). \n\nMore flexible (but probably more complicated to setup) would be Hydra ([https://www.ory.sh/hydra/](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/)). Hydra is an open-source OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect server that can be integrated with your existing identity provider. It is designed to handle complex authentication and authorization scenarios.   \n\n\nAlso check out Keycloak, FusionAuth and Okta.   \nIt's hard to say what's the most fure proof, firebase is backed by google and okta is a giant company as well so I'd say they are most likely the most future proof, but who knows.",

We decided to work around some of the security features we would have liked to use, due to the pricing exploding if we would have used it (e.g. M2M token pricing is crazy expensive if used intensively).\n\nWe are much happier with Keycloak, but you become responsible for upgrading and maintaining it. On the other hand, you upgrade when you want, not when Auth0 decides you need to, which can be an advantage as well. If you deploy it on a containerized environment with a managed database, the management is quite low.

Then add in the ability to negotiate sla’s and potentially some level of liability in your vendor contracts and it really makes sense to put it on a third party.",

So I built Socialaize to:\n\n* **Repost & transform content** across Instagram, Threads, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and more (without everything breaking).\n* **Automate scheduling & engagement** so you don’t have to manually post at the \"perfect time.\"\n* **Simplify workflows** to make handling multiple platforms actually manageable.\n\nI know social media automation isn’t a new concept, but I wanted something that actually *worked* smoothly without overcomplicating things. It’s been a long journey getting this live, and I’d love to hear your thoughts!\n\nHave you ever struggled with managing multiple accounts? What’s your biggest frustration when it comes to social media automation?\n\nIf you’re curious, you can check it out here: [Socialaize.com](https://socialaize.com).

I had a phase where Hootsuite and Buffer were my go-to, but I always felt like I was juggling more than I should. The biggest frustration for me was scheduling tweets in advance without them losing relevance due to delays in getting creative. That's where something like XBeast, which auto-generates tweets using AI, can be a game-changer—especially if you're focusing heavily on Twitter. Your tool, Socialaize, sounds like a lifesaver, offering solutions to multiple platform management. What's been the biggest surprise for you during your development journey?",

No agency wants to pay their developers to copy something when they could just pay a very low $X fee for a subscription, and that's the reality of this industry.\n\nBest of luck on your projects and job search.",

I’m tasked with managing their online visual rebrand / website dev - I’m planning to use Wordpress for this project along with mass customizations :)\n\nClient inherited the online ordering/point of sale system from the previous restaurant owner on the Toast platform. (doesn’t appear to have any Wordpress integrations)\n\nI suspect my client may have inherited something that’s simply not great.\n\nClient’s restaurant is smaller and local, offering only online ordering for pick-up / not delivery, and in-person dining.\n\nWhile i can integrate the current Toast system through a simple link/button/cta on the site for now, my question is, what other online/point of sale systems or other options suited for small-scale restaurants are worth checking out? \n\ni don't want to recommend investing in Toast integrations if there's a better long-term solution.  The client does want to be hands-on with managing the menu/pricing/etc & i'd like to include the menu dynamically in the site at some point.\n\nTIA! xx\n\n",

        "selftext": "I have a platform I built for music artists where we integrate our Google Adsense account on their custom profiles to generate income for them. Manually creating the profiles and payouts has been the biggest issue to scale so I reached out for quotes on developing the website. At it's simplest form it's a sign up page, a custom profile with 5-10 pieces of info and a dashboard for the artists to see their page views and withdraw earnings. So far HubSpot and their recommended developer quoted me at $18k. Google Cloud and their developer quoted me at $12k+$600/mo for servers+$650/mo for maintenance. Although I don't know much about developing, the project seems very simple to me. Am I getting overcharged? Is there a better place for me to go?\n\nEdit: Here are the scope of services I received  \n  \n**Scope of Services** Developer will provide the following services. The project will include the following features:\n\n* **Artist Profile Management:**\n   * Artists can sign up and create profiles.  \n   * Artists can upload images, links to social media, and other promotional materials.  \n   * Artists can withdraw their earnings.  \n* **Google AdSense Integration:**\n   * Integrate Google AdSense into artist profiles to generate revenue.  \n   * Automatically calculate and distribute earnings between Music HQ and the artist.  \n* **Payment Gateway Integration:**\n   * Integrate with Stripe or a similar payment gateway for secure transactions.  ",

So it could only mean 30-40 hours to build a simple app plus a few hours a month to maintain it. \n\nAlso you said you're not familiar with software projects which means you need more hand holding and the scope of the project is more likely to get out of control.

I have clients with complex websites that need monthly platform and package updates and it's generally about an hour a month unless there is a major breaking change.\n\n\nAs far as servers go, my firm owns servers in a data center and we host the majority of our clients, and our dedicated server is $200/month.  The only downside is that you don't get redundancy for that cost - if the server goes down then it's down until it's back up. For some clients any downtime is unacceptable and so they have a backup server which then doubles the cost. For most clients a minor outage is fine. In fact, the majority of our clients are on a shared server and they pay I think $20 a month.\n\n\n\nAs far as the development costs, it's hard to say without more information and actually looking at designs, but that doesn't necessarily seem outlandish. I'd actually hesitate to trust anyone who tells you you're paying too much or too little just based on the info you've provided, because as in everything else, in software engineering the devil is in the details. \n\n\nBut just *prima facie*, we're talking a few pages, a payment processor integration, and an AdSense integration, and so 12k-18k is not crazy by any stretch. \n\n\nAt my billing rate, that's about 105 hours on the high end. Let's subtract 15% for project management, 10% for deployments and QA, 30 hours for the front facing pages, and that leaves us 40ish hours for the integrations.\n\n\nAgain, totally detail dependant but that's not nuts. \n\n\nFeel free to shoot me a PM if you'd like to set up a more thorough discussion and get another quote. My firm has been in business for 20+ years and our clients run the gammut from the local humane society to nationally known food brands (Tito's Vodka, Kettle Chips, General Mills), to government agencies (NASA), and we even have some exposure in the music space, having developed a special event ticketing system for an American Express venture.",

        "author": "aeshaeshaesh",
        "id": "1km93fv",
        "selftext": "Hey r/webdev,\n\nCame across this open-source project called **Locawise** today and thought it was worth sharing, especially for those of us juggling multilingual web apps. It looks like a pretty smart solution for automating the often painful process of translating language files (like `.json` or `.properties`).\n\n**What it seems to do:**\n\nFrom what I gather, Locawise uses AI (you can point it to OpenAI or Google VertexAI) to automatically translate new or changed strings in your source language files. The cool part is it seems to be context-aware – the docs mention you can set up a project context, a glossary for specific terms, and even a desired tone through a YAML config file. This could be huge for getting more relevant translations than just basic machine translation.\n\nThere are two main parts:\n\n1. `locawise` **(Python CLI tool):** This is the engine that does the change detection and translation. Seems like you'd run this locally or in scripts if you wanted to.\n2. `locawise-action` **(GitHub Action):** This is what really caught my eye for web dev workflows. You can apparently set this up in your GitHub CI/CD, and when you push updates to your main language file (say, `en.json`), it automatically translates the new bits into your other languages and then *creates a Pull Request* with all the updated files. That sounds like a massive time-saver!\n\n**Why this looks useful for web devs:**\n\n* **Automates Tedious Stuff:** No more manually tracking every new string and copy-pasting translations for all your `xx.json` files.\n* **CI/CD Friendly:** The GitHub Action creating PRs means it slots right into a modern Git workflow. Keeps your language files in sync with your codebase with less fuss.\n* **Handles Common Formats:** Supports `.json` (which tons of frontend frameworks and i18n libraries like `react-i18next`, `vue-i18n` etc., use) and `.properties` (which might be relevant for some backends, like Java/Spring).\n* **AI with Control:** Using AI for translations is neat, but being able to guide it with context and a glossary seems like it would lead to much better quality than just throwing it at a generic translator.\n* **Free & Open Source:** Always a big plus! You'd only pay for whatever your chosen LLM provider charges for the API calls.\n\nLooks like it could be a really solid option if you're looking to internationalize a web app without wanting to pay for expensive platforms or spend ages on manual translation management.\n\nHas anyone else seen this or tried it out? Seems promising for streamlining how we handle multiple languages.\n\nHere are the links if you want to dig in:\n\n* **Locawise-Action (GitHub Action - this looks like the main thing for easy integration):**[https://github.com/aemresafak/locawise-action](https://github.com/aemresafak/locawise-action)\n* **Locawise (the core Python tool - for under-the-hood details):**[https://github.com/aemresafak/locawise](https://github.com/aemresafak/locawise)\n* **Looks like there's a quick tutorial too:**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b\\_Dz68115lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Dz68115lg)\n\n# Curious to hear what you all think!",

I spend a lot of time trying to figure out the best team, looking at stats, guessing who's gonna be good at which track...\n\nI had this idea for a website/tool that could help make those decisions a bit easier\n\nImagine a place where you could see:\n\nHow drivers actually perform on different types of tracks\n\nSome cool historical stats presented nicely.\n\n Maybe even some basic insights into potential points or price changes? (Not sure how feasible this part is!)\n \nMostly to view de performance of a team or a driver on a track.\n\n Quick look at the weather for the race weekend.\n\nBasically, a dashboard.\n\nI have basically zero coding knowledge. Like, nada. I wouldn't know where to start writing actual code\n\nBUT... I've been doing some digging!\n\n I actually found this cool API called HypRace on RapidAPI that seems to have tons of historical F1 data (results, drivers, tracks, standings - back to the dinosaurs, almost!). So getting the raw F1 data might be possible without scraping tons of tables myself. \n\n\nThis got me thinking about No-Code / Low-Code tools. I've heard names like Bubble, Softr, etc. Could these actually let someone like me build something like this visually?\n\nMy Big Questions :\n\n Is this idea even doable with No-Code tools?\n\nThe API has race results, but not the actual prices from the official F1 Fantasy game. How could I possibly get those updated prices onto my site without coding/scraping (which sounds super hard)? Has anyone managed something like this?\n\nHow would No-Code handle things like calculating potential points or suggesting optimized teams? Can you even build that kind of logic visually, or does it get crazy complicated?\n\nAny tool recommendations? If you've used No-Code for data-heavy sites or API stuff, which platforms felt intuitive for a beginner but were still powerful?\n\nJust looking for a reality check, any advice, tips, or maybe just to hear if anyone else has going down a similar path!",

It's an area that often lacks transparency, dominated by proprietary cloud services or outdated open-source solutions.\n\n**What is Garlic-Hub?**\n\nGarlic-Hub is a self-hosted, open-source digital signage content management system (CMS). A complete digital signage setup typically involves two main components:\n\n* **Garlic-Hub (the CMS):** This is a modern CMS built with a contemporary tech stack for ease of use and deployment. Here's a quick look at its core:\n   * **PHP 8.3** with the **Slim 4 framework**\n   * **Docker** for simple, portable deployment\n   * **SMIL** (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) as an open standard for playlists\n   * Modern **vanilla JavaScript and HTML5** on the frontend to keep dependencies minimal\n* **Player:** I've already developed a dedicated media player called **Garlic-Player**, which is designed to run on a variety of platforms including Linux, Windows, macOS (Intel + Arm), and Android.\n\nI'm really keen to get the webdev community's input on this.\n\n# Ways to Contribute / Feedback Welcome On:\n\n* What key features would you expect to see in a robust digital signage CMS?\n* Would you be interested in testing or using Garlic-Hub in your projects?\n\nI’d be really happy if you could star the repo to show your support:  \n[https://github.com/sagiadinos/garlic-hub](https://github.com/sagiadinos/garlic-hub)  \nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback!\n\n**Docker images** available (x86 + ARM64):  \n[https://hub.docker.com/r/sagiadinos/garlic-hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sagiadinos/garlic-hub)",

        "selftext": "AI enabled coding with is a huge speedup. I can crank out a cool new feature demo in minutes. But I'd end up burning loads of tokens on [bolt.new](http://bolt.new/) or [lovablel.dev](http://lovablel.dev/) just to get a basic user context working reliably, when what I *really* wanted was to demo a new feature.\n\nTesting, flattening, cleaning out spaghetti, code duplication, race conditions, unnecessary complication, fixing tight coupling between components? That eats up the clock like crazy. And burns tokens like you wouldn't believe.\n\nI started building myself an app framework that I could reuse. I figure this is a typical problem, why not share my work with others? Here's what I've got:\n\nPrebuilt auth, database, subscriptions, AI chat\n\n* Supabase auth\n* Supabase db\n* Stripe subscriptions\n* ChatGPT components\n\nAI Chat\n\n* ChatGPT implemented\n* Designed in abstract to support multiple providers\n   * We'll set up Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Deepseek, etc too\n* Saves user history\n* Users can continue conversations\n\nLayered API structure\n\n* Supabase edge functions backend\n* Zustand store state management\n* Stateless RESTful API client\n* Decoupled front end\n\nMonorepo for multi platform - one backend, one store, one API\n\n* Web app: React, HTML, Tailwind web app\n* Windows desktop: Tauri / Rust installer w/ web app frontend\n* Android: react-native (not ready yet)\n* iOS: react-native (not ready yet)\n* pnpm\n\nUser management & analytics (Fresh today, NOT FULLY TESTED YET!)\n\n* Google G4\n* Chatwoot\n* User signup email lists (Still needs a hook built)\n   * Abstract method\n   * Designed to support most existing email automation platforms\n   * Implemented with Kit (formerly ConvertKit)\n\nTesting & Integration\n\n* Essentially all features & functions unit and integration tested\n* Deno tests on backend\n* Vitest for API and web frontend\n\nDatabase and Deploy\n\n* Supabase edge functions good to go\n* Supabase config file should set your hooks & functions automatically\n* Supabase migration files ready to run\n* Ready to deploy on Netlify\n* Netlify config file set up\n\nThis was all pretty much built with Bolt, Lovable, and Cursor.\n\nRight now it's not running in bolt or lovable (they use npm) but we're working on fixing that. We might have to drop the monorepo and npm to do that. :/\n\nA few cool things - Stripe products update automatically. We see new products in Stripe, populate your database, and the frontend generates a card to display to users. If you remove or archive a product, it'll do the same in reverse.\n\nI'm getting that set up for AI providers now so their model updates happens automatically too. And new users should add to Kit automatically.\n\nMost everything is set up with .env so you can just modify one file to customize the deployment for your own accounts. Get your Stripe keys & webhooks, your OpenAI keys, etc., plop them into your .env, and there ya go. Put in Google Analytics, Chatwoot, Mixpanel, and Kit and you should be rolling.\n\nYou can throw it right into Cursor and have most everything you need working, reliable, and tested.\n\nWhen you're ready, hop over to Netlify, connect to your Github, connect to your Supabase, slap a domain on it, and watch your app slide out live in prod fully ready for use!\n\nThis thing will save you around 25 million tokens getting a basic user environment in place, ignoring what it takes to build and pass unit and integration tests and handle all the edge function and webhook sync.\n\nI think we're at probably around $100 value in saved tokens - and a lot more in saved time and stress - but I'll give away copies to the first people who sign up and start giving me feedback.\n\nSee it running at [paynless.app](http://paynless.app/), fork it at [Github](https://github.com/tsylvester/paynless-framework). I'd love to get your feedback!\n\n**NOTE: Provided AS-IS, no warrantees or guarantees explicit or implied. We made it work, but some things aren't done yet, might have been missed, or only work \"for us\". We have no idea what you're going to do with it.**",

        "selftext": "We have a backend application built with AWS services. We're using AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) and Prisma for our database.  \nI need to integrate some data from files stored on our private FTP server. For this purpose, I won't be using AWS since the AWS implementation for the main infrasturcture was done by an outsourced developer. I'm just adding the new FTP functionality separately (using Node + TypeScript). What are my options? Here are all the details:  \nThe application is an internal platform built for a company that manages the data of a lot of musical artists. Admins can register new artists on the platform. Upon new artist registration, the artist's streaming data should be fetched from different digital sound platforms like Apple Music, Deezer, etc. (referred to as DSP hereon) stored as files on the FTP server. We have 6 DSPs on the server, so I'm planning to create a separate service for each platform. After the data is transformed and parsed from the files (which are in different formats like gz, zip, etc.), they should be put in the RDS database under the artist's streaming data field.\n\nI also need a daily crawler for all the platforms since they update daily. Please note that each file on the server is deleted after 30 days automatically. Here was the original architecture proposed by the outsourced developer:  \n**Crawler (runs daily):**\n\n1. Crawl FTP server\n2. Retrieve files from server\n3. Perform any transformation required based on platform and file type\n4. Store the transformed file in S3 bucket\n5. Maintain a pointer for last crawl\n\n**Processor (per Platform)**:\n\n1. Triggered by new files uploaded by Crawler in S3\n2. Obtain stream information from the files\n3. Store Stream information in database\n4. Delete file from S3\n\nSince I won't be using AWS and hence S3, how should I go with building it? What libraries can I use to make the process easier (like ftp crawler packages, etc.). Thanks in advance!  \n",

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nThis might sound as a rant, but I'll try to avoid those feelings\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found out about them when searching for freelance platforms. I saw \"hiring the top 3%\" so I figured that it was some hard screening process involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI applied to \"see what happens\" and scheduled my first call with a \"communication specialist\" where I talked about me, my work and expectations.\n\nAfter that, I received a online test with a deadline of 105 minutes since the start of the test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was a test with 4 tasks that were basically katas that you can find anywhere. The difficulty increased with every task. - the thing that bothered me is that the platform they are using gave you the task and a series of test values but not all test values. Behind the scenes they were running extra tests on your code and you end up getting a 75% when all your tests were green and not giving you a chance to revise your work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I then scheduled my next call with a technical screener where I also talked a bit about myself and my projects. After that I had to pass a few tasks that represented me doing some algorithms to solve some problems like \"how many of each coin you would receive as a change when paying for something with a larger bill\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI chose to do it in javascript and got stuck because of how numbers work in js (3.4 was represented as 3.3999999) so I end up using 10 out of the max of 15 minutes trying to figure that out. The technical screener failed me and said I could reapply in 1 month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter 1 month I scheduled again the technical call and got assigned a different screener. This time I passed both  algorithmic tasks and he said that I will be receiving the final task that is a web app that I should make with a deadline of 2 weeks.\n\nA bit about the tasks: First one I had a deadline of 10 minutes and the second one, more difficult, a deadline of 20 minutes. This time constraint is very nerve wrecking especially when trying to figure out the correct algorithm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow back to the web app: I received an invitation to their internal git and a mail with the web app requirements: A travel web app where a user can manage their trips:\n\n\\- user can authenticate\n\n\\- user can add / edit / delete trips\n\n\\- user can have 3 roles - so a user can be basic, manager or admin\n\n\\- trip has destination, start date, end date and comment\n\n\\- on display, trip should have countdown to start date\n\n\\- user can filter through trips\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd other talk about ui/ux, bonus for unit tests, etc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, here is where I decided to write them an email about me dropping out.\n\nFirst, I have 8+ years of experience\n\nSecond, I have worked on projects that are now in production; one of them was built by only me from scratch\n\nThird, this kind of task was received by a friend of mine with less than a year of experience\n\nFinal, I won't to any unpaid work for nothing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I cannot feel anything but offended and mocked. I went along with the algorithm part because I figured it was good practice. But if they choose to ignore my experience and give any candidate a junior-level 2-week task without any compensation I am not sure how they can market themselves as hiring the \"top 3%\". More like \"top 3% juniors\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I hope this will help some of you not waste valuable time",

Again your code is wrong, it was not javascript but you failing a second junior-level task.\n3. About the final task it may take as long as you want, they do not define every small detail ( and do not demand unit tests ).  So you could even do a simple version in a few days.\n4. About the number of steps or the general flow, all of it is described in details in their page, so you you knew what to expect and evaluate whether it was worth or not for you to take part in it.\n5.

Beyond that, as you are a sole proprietor, it's absurd to give you this much unpaid work, just to decide if you're allowed to advertise on the site. \n\nFrankly, I hope sites like this and Codeable get shut down in glorious fashion by the Department of Labor...",

The digital marketing space is moving fast and things like live chat, a/b testing, integration with ad platforms, etc.. are becoming table stakes.  Do some research and pick a platform:  Wix, Hubspot, Squarepace, and just use their WYSIG tools.  They usually have hooks into their source code for custom code if you really need it.  \n  \nDISCLAIMER:  I do not work for marketing platforms.  I needed a website and started where you started from.  I did some research learned what the state-of-the-union of website building is.   The state of the union is that the WYSIG tools are pretty good and the website should be integrated into the larger marketing tech stack - which plenty of good platforms do for a reasonable price, hosting included.",

After years of research and academic validations, we ended up coding a new approach that eliminates having any single 'master key'- effectively removing the greatest hacker target.\n\nWe've made this because:\n\n* We've seen too many breaches by no fault of the web tech (rogue admins, supply chain attacks, etc)\n* Traditional IAM systems sit at the center of all security with catastrophic outcomes when breached\n* We were after an approach where even when breached, there's nothing to steal\n* Certification and SLA are great - but ability to **verify** in realtime should be the only guarantee\n\nBasically, what it does:\n\n* It's a small extension of the open-source [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) IAM that plugs into our decentralized \"cybersecurity fabric\". We call it TideCloak.\n* Users' identities are generated and operated as keys across the decentralized fabric, with no single node having access to any key.\n* The result: no one, not the users, an attacker, an admin or or even us can ever get the keys.\n\nWho this helps?\n\n* Admins never need to manage or rotate complex keys, or worry about the ID loss of a breach.\n* Users get \"self-sovereignty\" over their identity. No one can impersonate them.\n* When building a multi-tenant SaaS platform, you (the dev) don't need to worry about a breach of user credentials because not even you have access to it.\n\nGive it a shot:\n\n* The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tide-foundation/tidecloak-client-nextJS) with a README that explain all you need to **get it up and running in minutes**.\n* A short Next.js example will demo how to integrate it to any sign-in/sign-up flow.\n* For the curious inquisitors, [here's](https://tide.org/blog/rethinking-cybersecurity-for-developers) a link to a series of posts describing the why and how in great detail. If you're really keen, our publications are available too.\n\nFeel free to poke around and ask questions. We're genuinely interested in hearing from you. For those interested in more than passively trying on their own, we've opened up a closed (free) alpha program and will be happy to engage on your project directly.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow devs,\n\nI'm a LatAm-based freelance developer with 8 years of experience across several global talent platforms including Toptal and other Toptal alternatives. On platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, the challenge is real, especially with Asian talents offering rates backed by their low living costs. Not to mention, many clients there tend to undervalue your expertise, making long-term, quality gigs a rarity.\n\nFor someone with my experience, platforms like Cloud Devs and other Toptal alternatives for niche talents stand out. They focus more on quality, value the talent, and offer a space where developers aren't constantly undercut.\n\n## Leading Toptal Alternatives for Developers in 2024:\n\n\nBest Toptal alternatives:\n\n# [CloudDevs](https://clouddevs.com/)\n\nAlthough they’ve been around only for a few years, they have really made their mark in the industry. Just do a simple google search for ‘hire Latam developers’, and they’ll be the first on your organic search results.\n\nHaving worked with them for the better part of the last two years, my experience has been nothing short of fantastic. Their client charge is just a transparent 20% fee (same as Upwork) except they provide fully vetted talent at that cost so the clients are getting a great deal unlike with Toptal which keeps between 50% to 100% margins. In addition, working with their small team makes you feel like a real person, not just a nameless pawn in a multinational company that will forget you exist at any given moment.\n\nTheir clients are primarily based in the US. This is their reason for hiring Latin Am talent, as they are the closest to the time zone of their clients. If you’re a senior developer with 5+ years of experience, confident in your tech stack, and have excellent English communication skills, I highly recommend applying through the Clouddevs site. Although they conduct extensive vetting with live coding challenges, language assessments and problem-solving assessments, their interview process feels very personal at each stage as there are no automated interviews.\n\nThe best part about working for CD is that the platform matches you up with the clients they feel are the best choices for you. So you don’t get stuck on projects beyond your expertise or interest, nor do you have to look through open positions and send out proposals to individual clients. CD manages all project technicalities, deadlines, payments etc., so again, none of it falls on your shoulders. As an added bonus, Cloud allows clients to buy you out of their platform if they love working with you, so you can directly work with a client you like as a full-time employee.\n\nAs a senior dev working full-time for Cloud Devs, I easily take home USD 100K+ per year. And unlike Toptal and other Toptal alternatives which generally offer short-term staffing gigs, Cloud Devs focuses on long-term contracts that are on average at least a year (or more) so I get solid work throughout the year.\n\nSo overall, I highly recommend working for Clouddevs if you think your talent fits the requirements.\n\n# [Unicorn.Dev](https://www.unicorn.dev/)\n\nNow if you’re a senior dev from a location other than the LatAms, Cloud has launched an international talent platform that you can join. Unicorn.Dev follows the same talent vetting and screening system as CloudDevs and sticks to identical standards and guidelines as it’s managed by the same folks.\n\nSo you do not have to worry about being left to fend for yourself. They’ll ensure you get continuous work and long-term projects to sign up for. And similar to CD, Unicorn.Dev will handle all your payments, oversee project management and coordinate with the clients.\n\nAnd the best part about this Toptal alternative is the price point they offer their clients. Due to the very low commissions they keep, Unicorn Dev is able to offer devs at 35USD per hour for their customers which make the platform extremely attractive for young startups and bootstrappers. Hence you’ll always manage to find work within the platform and you can expect to work with some fascinating new entrepreneurs!\n\nThe final platform I have some experience with is Bairesdev.\n\n# [Bairesdev](https://www.bairesdev.com/)\n\nI joined Bairesdev because marketing fooled me into thinking it's a recognized dev platform offering Latin American talent high quality clients. They conducted a strict vetting and screening process with multiple interviews with very robotic recruiters who didn’t seem to have a care in the world about who you are and what you did. But before you actually get to the interviewers, Baires is notorious for setting up numerous automated tests that all of us have to undergo. Let’s say all that is fine coz their intention is to get good talent? But what sort of senior talents would want to work for the crappy pay they end up offering?\n\nDuring the mere months I was there, the majority of projects that came my way were short-term gigs and at a pay that is way below average. I’ve heard fellow devs refer to Baires as a dev sweatshop, shouldn’t be a surprise why. So in my opinion Baires is the worst Toptal alternative out there.\n\nWhile a fresher may make some headway getting their feet wet in the industry through working for Bairesdev, it is unlikely that the senior dev talent is going to appreciate the work and payments that are on offer (I for one lasted only 3 months here).\n\n\nWhen it comes to all available alternatives, I choose CloudDevs as the finest toptal alternative. After many years of testing out other developer platforms, I found CD to be the most efficient in finding quality clients while paying you well.\n",

It sounded great. I am a web developer with 13+ years experience so I thought i'd be able to get a position there.\n\nMan was I wrong. I bombed out of the technical TEST twice. The first time i got a 34% and was told to spend a month on LeetCode and take the test again. Ok, done. But wait, what do these LeetCode algorthms have to do with me building wordpress and custom websites for clients?\n\nTest 3 2: failed with a 14%. Toptal's response: \"Please don't reapply for at least 2 years.\" Yeah ok. Not going to reapply at all as the 'tests' did not in any way test me for my 13 years experience.\n\nThat being said, I very quickly found a full time job as a senior web dev at a small agency earning more than TopTal had promised. PLUS I took on freelance projects independently ALSO earning more than I would have with TopTal, and from the sounds of OP's description, I am getting much more regular work from my freelance client than I would have with TopTal. Glad I dodged that bullet, inadvertantly.\n\nI do wish I'd known about CloudDevs at the time. But I'm guessing they have similar interview requirements and I would have bombed those too.",

Unfortunately, with Toptal it was a rip off coz they were literally minting money through our hard work and we weren’t even getting sufficient gigs.\n Complete opposite experience with Clouddevs for me. It’s a peace of mind to have them coordinate with clients and just send me the best gigs for my skills. As for their testing, I can assure its nothing ludicrous like toptal’s. Yes, they screen you, but it’s not some generic screening that everyone has to go through, it’s based on what you’re signing up to do.

I'm saying this because in parallel to applying for jobs on Toptal I am also actively scanning for projects independently and some other platforms as well, and the symptoms are the same everywhere. That being said, the \"competitive rate\" suggestion on Toptal is two fold: on one hand it helps you too to not to apply to something that is clearly out of your rate you'd be comfortable with - since you would not be accepted anyhow if you are over the client's budget. On the other hand it is also true that in general it incentivizes talents to aim lower and compete with each other with their rates - but the mechanics of bidding with your rates and getting accepted hasn't changed, clients back in the more lucrative days would still chose someone that could meet their budget, and from identical candidates they were choosing the one with the lower rates always, regardless whether toptal showed you a suggested competitive rate or not.  \nIf it would be only for the rate suggestion itself, it would be clear it is only toptal pushing rates down while potentially keeping the client facing rate the same and thus increasing their profit.

That means the design of the sites lives in templates on the server, and the blog entries are in a database of some kind, and the pages are generated on the fly by the server whenever they are called. There’s usually a management portion of the site, behind a login, that works the other way, to allow the author to edit the blog entries.\n\nWordpress and tools like it give an out-of-box solution for building this kind of site, but you still have to do some techie setup, particularly if you want your own domain.",

                "body": "> Let’s say a simple MERN project with a team of 10 members. \n\nI have to address a couple issues first. I'm not sure how, or why, MERN has taken over as the stack of choice for web dev courses, but my tinfoil hat tells me the organization behind MongoDB has a lot to do with it, and Node/Express were chosen to keep the scope of classes narrowed down to \"JavaScript\". The problem is, it doesn't reflect the real world.  \n\nI suppose it would be a little rhetorical to say Mongo doesn't exist in the professional world, because it does, but it's probably among the least common database choices out in the wild. The only people reaching for Mongo, it seems, are the ones who were trained on it, and don't have much experience in anything else. \n\nLarge corporations tend to lean on _every other kind of database_ for their solutions. The \"why\" is probably outside the scope of this comment, but it boils down to licensing, managed services and the fact that MongoDBs performance and support doesn't warrant the compromises you have to make.\n\nThe reason picking apart the stack for this question is because the scenario really doesn't exist. A project that requires 10 people isn't simple, and by extension your \"stack\" wouldn't be as simple as MERN. \n\nWith that, for everything else you're asking the right questions, but the answers vary wildly depending on the company. \n\n> Team Composition\n\nThis is usually for an engineering director to decide. It takes experience to understand how to match objectives with personnel. A director would decide \"who,\" not just in title, but in detail in regard to skill set, and the ability to hire the right people for those roles. \n\n> The approach of the project from start to finish? \n\nDepends heavily on the current state of the project (and the company). Is this a greenfield (new) project for a startup, or a brownfield (mature) project for a large tech company? In the former its not uncommon to spend a couple months in an exploration and planning phase before a single line of code is written. \n\nIn the latter, to simplify for the sake of a comment, a product manager will usually outline the high level requirements acquired from customer feedback, a business analyst will handle the translation of requirements into plan of action, an engineering manager will handle the nitty gritty of specific technical details and standards, and a project manager will handle the day-to-day operations of making sure the \"paperwork\" is kept in tact. \n\nOf course, again, this varies wildly by company and its resources. Many companies, especially smaller or less tech focused companies will often combine these roles and blur the lines between each role. \n\n> Communication and Collaboration: \n\nSlack or some variation. Project management software which is often Jira, but some competitors are making headway. And don't forget Zoom/Google Meet or some variation for \"face to face\".\n\n> Testing\n\nThis is a rabbit hole topic that even experienced, mature teams are constantly refining. In a very oversimplified nutshell, you have tests that run locally before pushing to PR (pull request), sometimes commit hooks are used to enforce this. More tests that are run on the PR itself before its allowed to be merged, then tests run again after the PR is merged before its deployed anywhere. \n\nGenerally, the engineers are responsible for automated testing. There is a lot of debate and varying philosophies when it comes to dedicated QA (Quality Assurance) people, ranging from \"it's the engineer's job and we don't have a QA team because the engineers need to test their fookin' code,\" to \"our QA team is as big as our engineering team because one time a mistake was pushed to production and now we need to constantly run 1,000 manual checks every time a new commit is made.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that, as much as you see the \"importance of unit/integration/e2e\" testing parroted in the industry, very few companies actually have a truly thorough and robust testing foundation. Most companies are focused on feature delivery, not testing, so when it comes time to cut corners to deliver on a timeline, the tests are the first thing to be cut; they're the least visible. \n\n> Deployment and DevOps.\n\nProbably even a bigger rabbit hole than testing. Again, for the sake of a reddit comment, it's largely broken down into two strategies: the more generic \"Branch Strategy,\" and \"Trunk Based Development\" \n\nBranch Strategy largely consists of long running branches: dev, stage and prod. About once a sprint (about two weeks), new features will be released by merging everything in dev into stage, then into prod, which gets checked at each stage and pushed to production if it passes QA.\n\nThis process is popualar because it can be implemented on any codebase and doesn't require any additional team discipline. But its not ideal. It creates \"merge hell\" scenarios.\n\nTrunk Based Development is constantly committing and pushing code to your main branch, or pulling code cosntantly from PRs. This is ideal because it avoid merge hell, along with an assortment of other issues, but requires ancillary support in the form diligent and robust automated testing and proper usage of feature flags. \n\nHowever, this is tougher to implement and generally requires strong leadership to implement properly. It's not a perfect system, no system is, and it's always tempting to resort back to Branch Strategy the first time a problem in produciton is experienced. \n\n> Common Challenges and Solutions\n\nThat's quite broad. If you had to narrow it down, the biggest challenges often fall under \"tech debt.\" All rojects inevitably acquire a \"known issues\" backlog that doesn't begin to capture the known problems \"under the hood.\" Unoptimized code, legacy experiments that were shut down and now only exist to confuse new comers to the code, and lack of documentation. \n\nIt's usually the result of the endless pursuit of new features, which must be completed before an arbitrary deadline centered around some kind of stakeholder event; which can be as mundane as \"quarterly goals.\"\n\nThe solution is usually to convince management that taking a break from feature sprints to address the issues would increase velocity, but its usually a tough sell. Companies that understand the importance of a well-oiled code base and workflow don't often have the need to present this kind of thing to management in the first place.",

Team composition will be 1 team lead, 1 product owner 1 dedicated QA and 5 full stack devs, we also have a dedicated UI person for the project, but to hit 10 people we would say 2 teams are working on this project. Both teams have other projects they're working on at the same time so while the lead + PO  + QAwould be working on every project, the fullstack devs may bounce in and out on a sprint to sprint basis.\n2. We use agile, and would have an epic fully refined, and the stories in order of priority + blocking\n   1. Each sprint we know how many story points we're allocating to this epic to hit our release date, so we'd grab that many story points out of the epic. The team lead will coordinate with the other team lead to make sure any dependencies from their epic will be handled to not block us and vice versa\n   2. The UI mocks are all completed by the UI team before refining is finished, however changes do happen all the time, and can happen even while the item is being worked on. Usually the dev will make some tweaks based on feedback or change some design decisions if something like a date picker component doesn't behave how the mock has it, and we missed that during refinement\n3. For communication + collaboration we are 100% remote so everything happens via Zoom, Slack, Jira and github\n4. We do code review, test, and product review, along with unit tests. Some products have integration testing, but not all. Testing has to be completed within the sprint\n5. We have Azure Pipelines setup so we get our release approved by the ELT and then we just have a single button deploy, however some other products require manual intervention.

Sometimes you'll see a couple of designers working alongside say, 10 developers, sometimes you'll see a bunch of management folks included there, like a project manager or team lead, and sometimes the devs also have to design the product too.\n\nBased on my personal experience, a 10 person team would usually have:\n\n* 1 or 2 designers\n* 1 or 2 QAs (in large companies)\n* 4-5 developers\n* 1 team lead\n\nAnd maybe a stakeholder said lead would report to.\n\nAs for the types of devs... it depends on the company and project. Sometimes everyone will be full stack and work on everything, sometimes you'll have frontend and backend devs working on different parts of the system, and sometimes one or the other gets outsourced to an agency or replaced by a third party system/product.\n\nProject workflow depends on how the company wants to manage things, ranging from the chaotic (no plan at all) to very traditional (waterfall setup where each stage goes in a strict order) to agile workflows based on sprints and tickets (more common nowadays).\n\nHonestly, project management is a whole field in of itself, and one which is often questionable in its implementation, so it's hard to go into much detail there.\n\nGit is used for version control in like 80% of projects now, likely more. Occasionally some more old fashioned ones will use Subversion or SourceSafe or Fossil or something else, but I've not seen that for years.\n\nProject management often involves something like Jira, and communication something like Slack or (unfortunately) Teams.\n\nHow testing is integrated depends on the way the project is managed. For agile workflows it's usually part of each ticket, where the dev implements automated tests first, goes through a PR process second, and (maybe) humans test it third. For old fashioned waterfall ones, you had a testing phase on its own.\n\nDeployment and DevOps are again, very company/team dependent. Some have a proper build process and pipeline, some just stick the finished product up via SSH or FTP. If the company's process is \"we work directly on PROD\", consider a new job.\n\nCommon challenges vary as much as the teams do. Sadly, a fairly common one (for less well managed companies) is \"the client/stakeholders have no idea what they want and keep changing their mind\".",

Depending on the project, you may need a DevOps to keep it from crashing your whole platform.\n\nThe numbers of each kind of dev depend on the extent of the BE and FE work. and the deadline. You will normally have 1 or 2 QA handling the project, and 1 or 2 (if it's really big) Design. Ops / Sales numbers depend on the extent of usage of the output, and maybe 1 DevOps / SysAdmin / Platform Ops.\n\n2. You start with PO gathering functional requirements from stakeholders. Then those get broken into tasks by the devs (or just a Tech Lead, maybe with a Staff Engineer for big ones). Once you have the business logic (BE), then you go to Design and finally FE. I worked at one place where they signed a contract for a specific FE. There was no way to get the resources CRUD complete and the company was tied to the contract. It was a nightmare, and I left after 2 days. Always start with BE.\n\n3. Communication and Collaboration are a BIG issue. I have a 10-part series on LinkedIn about it, five more articles planned, and then might really finish scratching the surface.\n\n4. Testing: You start with TDD or BDD development, building unit tests with the code. Then, deploy to a staging server where QA runs its functional end-to-end and UX tests. Then get approval from PO to ensure requirements were implemented correctly, maybe run load tests, and deploy to production.\n\nI can do the other 2 tomorrow",

You need not consolidate the payments, each was a seperate transaction.\n\nIf you want to validate your idea, build it and put it in the market.  With customer feedback, when consolidation becomes a requirement, create users and have a table of user/posts generate known user payments prior to standard reoccurring- only issue is to remove the strip reoccurrence when they go into consolidation mode.  Future problem.\n\nBuild it as simple as possible.  Use payment reference id to map to the post ids.\n\n— disclaimer: this is a generic pattern, not exactly meant as a step by step guide.  You will need to adopt this thought pattern for your application.",

Current situation: managing multiple clients, each with their own requirements gathering, tech stack discussions, GitHub access setup, deployment processes, etc.\n\nCurrent pain points:\n\n* No standardized way to collect technical requirements\n* Project setup varies per client (some need AWS access, others use their own infrastructure)\n* Managing access to different tools/platforms for each client\n* Tracking where each project is in the setup phase\n* Juggling different communication channels (Slack/Discord/email)\n\nI've looked at general freelance tools (Dubsado, HoneyBook), but they seem more geared towards creative freelancers. What I really want is something where I can:\n\n* Create custom workflow templates (e.g., different flows for web apps vs APIs)\n* Automate repetitive tasks (repo setup, project board creation, etc.)\n* Track technical requirements and dependencies\n* Handle contracts and payments\n* Give clients visibility into the technical setup process\n\nRight now I'm cobbling together Notion + Jira + various docs, but it feels inefficient. Wondering if there's a more dev-focused solution out there?\n\nIf not, would you use something specifically built for managing development clients? What features would you want to see?\n\nCurious to hear how other dev freelancers are handling this. Are you using any specific tools or just going with the flow?",

It can do Stripe subscriptions if that's the agreement (I try to encourage this, only 4 so far), and shows me all relevant info.   I don't directly integrate from the app into any clients repo other than to ping back some diagnostic info.  Instead, I have an SSH setup where I'm just a few keypresses away from being in any clients server / repo, whether that's a Wordpress shared server or a Digital Ocean droplet.  I have to copy this over to new machines whenever I switch, but it really is just a lot of copy / pasting.\n\nAlso as part of my work app, I made my own system to make a notepad for each client, just plaintext, which is on a URL (behind a login).  So I can access it from any device.  To give an idea, I have about 30 notepads between clients and myself, so I can't remember the last day that I didn't use it..

One of the goals is to create a platform in which subscribed writers can publish serialized stories divided into chapters, similar to Wattpad, Royal Road, or AO3—but with a much cleaner, simpler design.\n\nThe catch? I’m a philologist by training, not a web developer. I currently own a [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) site with unlimited hosting space, so I’m wondering: Could my idea be achieved with existing plugins? For example, a plugin to manage user submissions, chapter organization, and a minimalist reading interface.\n\nI've already tried using PublishPress Series, which is, as far as my knowledge goes, the closest thing there is to the plugin I'm looking for. However, everything happens in the backend, and doesn't really seem intuitive for new subscribers. \n\nShould I reconsider PublishPress Series? Are there other plugins? Should I go for a completely different route? \n\nThanks in advance! :)",

The other user did mention some workarounds, which is a great idea, but I really don’t think users would put in so much effort every time they need to publish a new post. Even at a smaller scale, like 50 posts per day, it would take hours of manual work to download and upload data.\n\nSince you mentioned your budget is tight, I’d suggest halting this project for now. WordPress will limit your idea, you need something custom. The best approach would be to save up a significant amount and later invest in building the project properly. Also, don’t invest in it if it’s your only savings; it creates unnecessary pressure. I’ve personally seen clients who wanted to invest everything they had into projects like this, but I turned them down because I understood the stress they’d face while the project was in development.\n\nIf you understand that tech projects are risky and may not have the growth you expect, you will be stress-free. Understand that it’s a long-term game, and every effort you put in today will contribute to future growth.\n\nAt last, I’ll repeat again, don’t work on such projects if the investment is your only savings. You need some financial backup, as tech projects are risky and may take significant time to grow.",

I'd go for 308 if I were you.

I was thinking of using a headless CMS like Strapi since it seems that it fully integrate with Next.js, what do you think?\n3. Does NextAuth makes workiing with Cognito easier or is there another identity provider recommended that works great with NextAuth?\n4. Can Next.js API Routes replace AWS Lambdas. I know that API Routes get deployed as lambdas, but I think API Routes and Vercel are much more expensive than AWS Lambdas & Amplify or Fargate\n5. Any other tools, platforms, etc...that I can/should use that will make my life easier? E-commerce platforms that have all these and is well documented and not crazy expensive?\n6.

        "selftext": "I was hoping I could get some thoughts and observations about my current position and role. It doesn't make sense to me that my company is run this way, but here I am.\n\nWe are an e-Commerce company (with a couple physical retail locations) that does about $15m a year through our Shopify website. We also do almost that much through Amazon. We have maybe 110 employees, most of which are in product development and fulfillment.\n\nI am the sole developer in the company. We have 1 IT guy, who helps run Netsuite as well as all IT functions. We have a Director of Technology who just started and is the 3rd one we've had in a year, who will mostly own Netsuite. I seldom speak with these people as our roles don't overlap.\n\nI do *everything* regarding the website. I am a Front End Dev by training with 18 years experience (both in agencies and ecommerce). So, obviously I manage the functionality and look/feel of our site. I also build & launch all of our products in Shopify (800+ SKUs), as well as maintain all of their information/images. I build all of the themes to swap for different site changes, promos or product launches. I build all of the discounts and promotions and upsells.  I own probably 25 of the 3rd party apps we have installed in our store to add functionality, meaning I am the point of contact if any of them have an issue. Search, cart, bundles, reviews, subscriptions, Klaviyo, etc.\n\nOur Shopify store was built by an agency 2 years ago, yet somehow I was not involved in that process. I was tasked with keeping our previous store running. The agency customized a ton of code because the our people involved *had* to have this or that functionality (most of which are no longer with the company anyway). There are no code comments or documentation of what they did or changed. This is my first Shopify experience, and I am trying to pick up Liquid as I go.\n\nSpeaking of customized solutions... we are also running both a B2B and D2C solution off of the same platform that was NOT designed to do that natively. We have custom scripts running to calculate prices and shipping rules that don't play nice with other things we try to accomplish.\n\nI am also the point of contact for all of our employees for any issue with Shopify via Slack. I am 2nd layer support for any of our customers who have store issues our CS team cannot solve.\n\nI report to the marketing manager. She is not very technical. I make just over 90k. I work remote from home. Luckily, I don't touch anything order related, nor Amazon or Netsuite.\n\nI have to ask... This isn't normal, right?\n\nI am barely keeping my head above water. I don't have any actual QA. I don't have any technical support (beyond Shopify support). I don't have any back up. I work on a non-technical marketing team. We are in the depths of holiday, and as you can imagine, it is unbelievably crazy.\n\nDo other $30m a year companies run like this?\n\nI often get approached from our VP of marketing with some idea that GAP or Sephora are doing on their website. Sure, that's a cool feature. I'm going to assume those places don't have a single developer who spends half his day context-switching.\n\nI've been here 6 years. When I started, we had 3 back end devs and myself. Slowly, they left and were never replaced. Which was why we went to Shopify. I guess this has been a 'slowly boil the frog' situation.\n\nI know I should probably find another job, but I live in a place that doesn't have a ton of jobs, and every remote job listing I see has 100+ applicants before I've even read it. I'm burnt out, looking for a sanity check.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "\nTL;DR junior dev had a vision of him jumping off a building to end it all because of stress from a relatively small project. Decided to give up on career instead.\n\n\nI gave up on programming after 1 year of getting a developer job. This is a long pure  rant, on how I gave up on myself after I had visions of me trying to self-harm for the first time in my life. \n\nI just freshly graduated in 2017. My final university project was a VR game made with unity. The project landed me a job at a company, and I was put to work on an unity app the company was contracted to do. This was a fringe project, nothing near their main projects, and most of it could be done in no more than 3-5 weeks but I spent 6 months on it because…well I had presented myself as a unity dev to my boss, and they had no other unity project, so I was just stuck there in limbo, maintaining and adding small features here and there for the client. Part of me was naive in waiting for one of my boss to come guide me, as I was still very new, but that part of me slowly understood. \n\nAfter 6 months, I felt extremely lost, lonely, deserted and felt like I have not learn anything coming to this company. My friend that had entered the company with me had moved on to another project. Before she moved on, she had done a back-office web for one of the company’s main project. Finally knowing that no senior is coming, I took the initiative to become the sole maintainer of this back-office after her to expand my skillsets and show that I am capable of learning and doing webdev. At this point, I have about 4 months of completely self taught frontend development from my previous internship in angularjs. I added features and maintained the back-office aimlessly for 2 months.\n\nAfter 2 months of maintaining the back office, I took the initiative again, and this time I was given an important job on the main project. At this point, I was super happy, the project however created so much stress for me that it would become my last. \n\nThe task was simple, there is already a main mobile app to this project, which is a chat-story / short story sharing platform. All of it is user generated content, and while the readers were having a great time reading it on their phone, the writers wanted a way to write their stories on their computers. So they tasked me with creating an text-editor on the web. All the apis were already all written, I just had to do the frontend, it sounded challenging but quite manageable.\n\nAt this point I had 4 months of front end experience + 2 months of nodejs / react from maintaining the back-office. The website was already up and running using .net core, with all the api already written, and some webpages using HTML engine. I figured the best thing to do is just  learn a bit of .net core, HTML rendering engine and get working on the frontend. \n\nI had initially projected to complete the project in 5-6 weeks, but I was deep 12 weeks into it and I was only 70-80% done. I don’t remember the details but I had spent a huge amount of time doing json parsing and trying to match the editor output from the web with the phone. I was completely stressed out, and remembered that one time the CTO came to me asking for my progress to speed things up and we had a small argument as I told him I couldn’t figure out one particular issue I was facing. He was basically asking why are you taking so long with this project. \n\nThe pressure keeps piling up as I am super late based on my earlier estimate. Then one day, 12 weeks after I have started, the company brought in 4 web developers and I knew right away one of their first job is to finish this web editor. \n\nI was stressed, writing about this is giving me migraine, and I had reached a breaking point. It was the first time I experienced migraines while programming / staring at the screen as I was trying so hard to get things done and learn the project. I was under high stress for more than 10 weeks without realizing, and I didn’t know I was pushing my limit. One day, I wanted to finish the project so bad I pushed myself to think of what is left and try to plan it out before I go to sleep. That night, the feeling of being a failure, the stress and migraine all came crashing and I had a dream of trying to jump of a building so that it would all go away. \n\nI knew at that moment that was the end of this journey for me. The next morning, I gave my boss a 2 weeks notice, not having a job lined up, and not telling anyone except my girlfriend.\n\n I picked up coding again 1 month after that, writing a website with contentful and gatsby but I couldn’t finish. \n\nThen again trying to do react native app… about 1 month after that but not finished. \n\nAll in all I have about 4 months a angular, 2 months of node/react, 3 months of vanilla js, 1 months of gatsby, and 2 weeks of react native.\n\nTo a total of almost 1 year of frontend development. And I barely remember any of it… and I have absolutely almost zero knowledge of any other stuff about webdev. Looking back, I never got project from start to finish and this is one of the worst things to repeat.\n\nAlways finish what you started, but also take care of your stress. Work is not stress. Work can be fun, exciting and full of meaning. Learning is also important. Fundamentals is also very important. A Very expensive lesson.",

Then being heckled about deadlines when trying to understand concepts such as parsing etc.  \n\n\nYou've been hopping around frameworks, probably with eyes glued to stack overflow - that doesn't teach someone how to program, only how to copy and paste.   \n\n\nMy honest advice here is to do a hard reset. Find a boring job with enough money to support yourself - and find your passion again. Start from the ground up by completing guided courses and complete some projects. Your experience in the industry is common, but not at all standard.   \n\n\nLook for junior roles when the time is right, find one with a solid support structure in. You've not done anything wrong here - you've just been pushed off a cliff without knowing how to fly. Don't be so harsh on yourself.  \n\n\nDon't let your bad run ruin what many of us find to be an amazing career.

You should have had a senior engineer as a buffer and guiding you to failure. Yes i say failure because your first year is usually going to be met with 99% failure. Its okay, it happens because of the exact problems you described which are underestimating and over reaching. It is a skill that takes time as a developer to hone. Even after you become good as time estimation and balancing work you will still miss deadlines every now and then. \n\nYou will learn manay languages, frameworks, paradigms and designs throughout your career. They amount to basically norhing bc you will not retain them all. There is a usual 15-30% time estimation added when taking on a new project written in a different language or hardware for re-learning.\n\nWhat you are suppose to actual learn as a jr. Dev is stress/time management, time estimation, and foundational habits like commenting and documenting. \n\nThe company could have been a bad fit but learning your boundaries and capabilities are what you need to focus on. This is all takes time and is the point of having a sr. Dev to act as a buffer. A sr. Dev knows how to keep tasks on track and how to not get stressed in front of management or team members. \n\nYou are going to fail all the time as a developer.

They know they are going to be dealing with outsourced projects no one else wanted to do and ruthless expectations to hit difficult timelines and budgetary requirements.

Something they put their own brand name on and support. Ideally a company that's been around the block a bit. Avoid \"startups\" - they might make sense later, but right now you want to join a proven team.

There's a lot of that throughout your resume and I guess could be buzz worthy for a recruiter that doesn't know the job, but if anyone technical reviews this they'd probably just pass as it feels like a bunch of buzz words.\n\nI however am no resume expert and is just my 2 cents.",

If you’re part of a web dev agency or have experience in this field, I’d love to hear your insights!\n\nWhen a client wants to make a change to their website after it’s been delivered, what’s the process like? Do they usually call you, send an email, or submit a ticket through some system?\n\nI’ve heard from a few people that email is a common way clients send change requests, but it seems pretty inefficient to me. It’s easy to lose track of details, there’s no clear priority system, and managing multiple requests can quickly become overwhelming.\n\nIf your agency uses a ticketing system, I’m curious about:\n\nHow does the ticketing process work for you?\n\nIs it something your clients find easy to use?\n\nDoes it help streamline communication and avoid back-and-forth emails?\n\nAre there any tools or platforms you’d recommend for managing client requests efficiently?\n\nI’d love to know what’s worked well for you or what hasn’t when it comes to managing change requests.\n\nThanks in advance for your insights!

        "author": "troubleBreathin",
        "id": "1hby622",
        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI’m building a SaaS platform and considering whether to use a microservices architecture or stick to a monolithic approach for the initial release. The platform involves several domains, such as user accounts, profiles, search, bookings, notifications, and payments, each of which could theoretically be its own service.\n\n**The Challenge:**  \nI’m working with a tight budget, and I also plan to set up multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production), meaning hosting costs will multiply for databases and services. Additionally, I’m currently a solo developer, so while I see microservices as a great learning opportunity, I recognize they might not be strictly necessary for my initial launch.\n\nFor context, I expect the launch period to handle no more than 10000 users, and that's if things go absurdly well. I’m not sure at what scale microservices actually make sense in terms of benefits outweighing the added complexity.\n\nOne idea I’m exploring is using a single shared database backing domain-based services split into an ECS cluster. This could help me reduce hosting costs while still giving me a microservices-style structure. However, I want to avoid building myself into a corner where a future refactor to full microservices becomes unnecessarily painful.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is a monolithic architecture a better starting point for a SaaS project with budget constraints and modest user expectations?\n2. If I go with a single database backing multiple services, are there pitfalls I should watch out for?\n3. If full microservices are worth pursuing, what are the most cost-effective options for hosting databases for each service?\n   * Managed cloud databases like AWS RDS or Cloud SQL seem ideal but expensive for multiple services.\n4. Are there any platforms or tools that can help simplify managing a hybrid or microservices-based architecture while keeping costs low, especially for someone working solo?\n\nIf you’ve faced similar trade-offs or have insights on balancing cost, complexity, and scalability, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",

It's harder than most people realize. Most people learn how to optimize the hard way (e.g. after catastrophic and repeated crashing or performance issues).\n\n> If full microservices are worth pursuing,\n\nWhat do you think microservice design provides? \n\n> what are the most cost-effective options for hosting databases for each service? \n\nThat depends entirely on your use cases and specific app requirements.\n\n> Are there any platforms or tools that can help simplify managing a hybrid or microservices-based architecture while keeping costs low\n\nNo. Microservices are inherently complicated. Any attempt to add an abstraction layer is going to remove control, which is a central point to going that route to begin with. \n\n> especially for someone working solo? \n\nMicroservices are entirely pointless for a solo endeavor. I'd highly recommend reading more about the design pattern to understand what it's about. It's not a buzz word or magic scalability sauce. It's a solution for large corporations that have the resources to handle the added complexity and overhead in exchange for operational benefits.",

If you run into performance problems, you can always pay for faster VMs, add caching, or start improving your slow performance, but every approach is a lot simpler with a single service.\n\n10k users is _not a lot_ for well-made software. People used to have single servers in a closet for that number of users.

        "author": "kibe_kibe",
        "id": "1jh1fte",
        "selftext": "Heys!\n\nI built an AI-powered platform that lets real estate agents create virtually staged property photos in seconds. I wanted to share my journey building this from concept to launch in just 3 days, along with the technical challenges I faced and how I solved them.\n\n**The Problem I Solved**\n\nReal estate agents pay $25-35 per image for virtual staging, which gets expensive fast. I built a platform that does it for as little as a few cents per image using AI, while making it dead simple to use.\n\nTech Stack & Architecture\n\n•\tSystem: Ruby on Rails 8 with Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)\n\n•\tDatabase: Self-hosted PostgreSQL\n\n•\tAI Integration: Gemini with custom prompt engineering\n\n•\tImage Processing: Active Storage with Cloudflare R2\n\n•\tPayment Processing: Stripe\n\n•\tDeployment: Self-hosted on a cloud VPS\n\nNote: I did use an existing Rails boilerplate that I've been using for years, so it was quicker for me to put all things together in a few days - I didn't have to start from auth, core payments system and such, it was just the business logic for this idea that I concentrated on\n\n**Key Technical Challenges & Solutions**\n\n**1. Real-time Progress Updates**\n\nProblem: AI image generation takes about 10 seconds, sometimes more, and users need feedback.\n\nSolution: Implemented a status tracking system with WebSockets (ActionCable) that updates the UI in real-time as images process through different stages. Turbo docs are quite scanty on this so I had to dig for a while to fix issues\n\n**2. Prompt Engineering for Consistent Results**\n\nProblem: Generic prompts produced inconsistent staging quality, while overly specific prompts completely produced bogus outputs, outdoing even the generic prompts. Took me a while to figure this out.\n\nSolution: Created a hierarchical data model with room-type specific furniture requirements combined with staging theme style guidelines.\n\n**3. Handling High-Volume Processing**\n\nProblem: Multiple users uploading images simultaneously could overwhelm the system.\n\nSolution: Built a job queue system with SolidQueue that manages concurrent processing while providing real-time status updates.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n1. Start with core value first: I focused on making one thing work first before going on to the next, and built the working MVP in 3 phases(simply called them phase 1,2 and 3), I did this.bottom-up though, i.e start from payments to sign up to virtual staging. Knowing what I know know, I should have started from top-bottom, starting with virtual staging and working my way down. This way I would've solved the important problems first\n2. UI feedback is critical: Users need simple clear indication of background processes, but do not spend too much time making it fancy, simple is best\n3. Manually test your prompts: I learnt more by manually prompting Gemini and looking at the results. It took a while to figure out what works best but had I not spent time on Gemini, I would've taken even longer to get good results\n\n**What's Next**\n\nI'm working on supporting multiple file uploads - I want realtors to just upload all the photos once and sit back as they wait for the results while we do the hard work. The platform is live at [REVirtualStaging.com](https://www.revirtualstaging.com) if you want to check it out.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the build process or technical decisions!",

        "author": "Ready-Essay-5108",
        "id": "1gphqfq",
        "selftext": "Here’s a look at the top web development trends for 2025, each offering unique advantages and examples of real-world applications.\n\n**1. AI-Driven Development**  \nIn 2025, AI tools are transforming web development, simplifying complex processes and speeding up coding. **Tools like GitHub Copilot** assist developers by handling repetitive coding tasks, fixing errors, and suggesting improvements. This not only saves time but also lets developers focus on solving higher-level issues, making AI a key player in efficient, personalized web experiences.\n\n**2. Low-Code and No-Code Platforms**  \nLow-code and no-code platforms have made it easy for anyone, even without coding skills, to build websites by simply dragging and dropping elements. **Platforms like Webflow** let designers create responsive websites without deep technical knowledge, allowing businesses to launch faster. This trend enables businesses to keep pace with frequent updates without needing to rely solely on development teams.\n\n**3. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**  \nPWAs are bridging the gap between websites and native apps, providing app-like experiences directly through the browser. For instance, **Starbucks**’ PWA lets users order and receive notifications without an app download. Offline functionality is a standout feature, allowing users to interact with apps even without internet connectivity, making it ideal for consistent user engagement.\n\n**4. Voice Search Optimization and Voice UI**  \nWith more people using voice-activated devices, optimizing websites for voice search is essential. Platforms are now integrating natural language processing and schema markup, making it easier for voice assistants like **Siri and Alexa** to interpret content. This trend improves accessibility and offers a hands-free experience, aligning with how users search and interact today.\n\n**5. Serverless Architecture**  \nServerless architecture is transforming how developers manage infrastructure. With services like **AWS Lambda**, **Netflix** efficiently handles vast traffic loads, scaling resources automatically as demand changes. This architecture supports high-traffic applications, eliminates downtime, and reduces costs by charging only for the resources used.\n\n**6. Cybersecurity and Privacy**  \nIn a world of increasing cyber threats, cybersecurity remains a priority. Advanced encryption, two-factor authentication, and compliance with privacy regulations like **GDPR** ensure user data remains safe. As cyber-attacks increase, developers are integrating robust security measures to protect users and businesses alike.\n\n**7. Web 3.0 and Decentralized Applications (dApps)**  \nWeb 3.0 emphasizes decentralized applications that provide secure, user-controlled data storage. **dApps** use blockchain to prevent data centralization, enhancing security and reliability by removing the risks of a central server. This shift empowers users, offering control and privacy.\n\n**8. Augmented and Virtual Reality**  \nAR and VR are making websites interactive and immersive. **IKEA uses AR** to help customers visualize products in their space, while VR is helping real estate platforms offer virtual tours, creating more engaging customer experiences.\n\n**9. Dark Mode and UI Design Trends**  \nDark mode, along with design elements like 3D visuals and micro-animations, enhances user experience by improving visibility and aesthetics. **Twitter** and **Google Chrome** offer dark modes, which reduce eye strain and conserve battery, making it a user-preferred feature.\n\n**10. Advanced API Integrations**  \nAPIs are essential in modern web development for connecting multiple platforms. **Zapier’s API** integrations allow apps to communicate and automate workflows, while payment APIs enable seamless, secure transactions. APIs are key to building interactive, data-driven applications that enhance user engagement.\n\nThese trends are reshaping how websites are developed, with each trend addressing specific user needs for efficiency, personalization, and engagement.\n\n*Check here for the* [*Resource*](https://deftsoft.com/blog/web-development-trends-to-watch-in-2025/)*!*",

The interface connects seamlessly to MongoDB, enabling smooth read/write operations with no issues. It also generates PDF reports efficiently.\n\nWhile some coworkers were initially hesitant to adopt the digital platform I designed and deployed, I managed to convince many of them by emphasizing ecological benefits—specifically, the need to reduce paper consumption.\n\nNext month will be a crucial test for the system, with an expected volume of about 100 read/write operations in a single day. \n\nThe server is hosted on our intranet and runs on a standard desktop with Ubuntu 20.04, 32GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The app is developed in HTML, CSS and JS. The package.json file is as follows:\n\n `{{\"dependencies\": { \"body-parser\": \"^1.20.3\", \"cors\": \"^2.8.5\", \"dotenv\": \"^16.4.5\", \"express\": \"^4.21.0\", \"mongoose\": \"^8.6.3\", \"multer\": \"^1.4.5-lts.1\"},`\n\n `\"devDependencies\": {\"nodemon\": \"^3.1.6\", \"webpack\": \"^5.95.0\", \"webpack-cli\": \"^5.1.4\" },`\n\n  `\"scripts\": { \"start\": \"node server.js\", \"dev\": \"nodemon server.js\", \"build\": \"webpack --mode production\"}}`\n\nGiven this setup, I'd like to know if my current configuration can handle this level of traffic reliably. My professional reputation depends on its performance during this trial period. Do you recommend any other stuff I need to know about? Thanks a lot\n\n*P.S.: The work I did will not promote my career at our organization. I'm simply an eco-friendly guy, passionate about sustainability and forest conservation!*",

This tool can run checks during your pre-commit or pre-push Git hooks, or as part of your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nThe tool intelligently detects hardcoded secrets in your code and prompts you to either remove or sync them with the platform. You’ll also have the option to configure which files to ignore, set up custom scanning rules, and more. Of course you can assume the model is private and running on something like AWS bedrock (not sending data to OpenAI, lol). \n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Would you use a tool like this?\n* How important is it that the tool is intelligent and customizable?\n* What are your thoughts on running scans before committing or pushing your code?\n* Any features you’d love to add?\n\nLooking forward to your feedback!

        "selftext": "**TL;DR: When to know when to cut your losses on a new ricocheting client?**\n\nSomeone I knew tangentially from a business transaction was struggling to make ends meet with her new business, so I offered to help with my skills and interests, some of which I was learning.\n\nThings were progressing nicely, though she struggled understanding some necessary things with marketing and management. I can't call myself a pro with those things but I knew enough tangentially to make things work. I offered the services free to a certain point because I wanted the project on my portfolio and we got along well.\n\nHowever, when it came down to images, I mentioned that I'm not a designer. She didn't like that answer, and said the previous team (which she said she couldn't afford) did that. I offered to do the free parts and they could send me the images. She didn't want separate entities working on the project. I later learned they also wrote all of the content, and a lot of it looked AI-generated. I generally don't write content, though AI makes things easier, which she at least understood.\n\nMaybe this is the point where I should have cut ties: she said she has no money to spend, but insisted on a professional designer. Since I saw her just pay for something necessary for business management (not a big expense), I couldn't tell if she was being hyperbolic or not. I said, look, I don't know everything, but I'm offering you free marketing recommended by the hosting platform that the pros you paid didn't try. She kept going back and forth, eventually left on a \"let me talk to the other team\" note, and I figured why not see if I could just make the free marketing work.\n\nShe texted me some time later, saying she really needed bookings (she didn't have a scheduler set up, oddly), and I tried what I could, but after suggesting some shortcuts, she removed my access to the marketing page and ignored my texts.\n\nSo, while I learned some things about the tech/marketing stack, ultimately I couldn't even try what looked like would work quickly and cheaply for her situation.\n\n**Anyway, is it better to be more skeptical than this with new clients?** I'm sort of new at consulting in the wild world myself, and I don't want to insult anyone or lose good leads, but the ping-ponging and apparent mixed messaging surprised me near the end.

I think it can definitely scratch an itch, though you'll have to make sure that it isn't just an extra step to copy pasting components from other websites like tailwind ui. If there is a unique selling point there besides the convenience, it wasn't immediately obvious from your landing page.\n\nThe video shows I can edit text, I miss a display of similarly fast-prototype related features in the video, globally changing fonts/colors would be a bonus. I see I can add classes, but it'd be nice if the basics were offered through the UI so I can quickly test things out, rather than offering me what is basically a code editor, which I'd assume most people are trying to avoid at that stage in the project.\n\nIn that same vein, you advertise 'production-ready' code. But I wonder if that is a, true, and b, what your target audience is looking for. That's up to you to figure out!\n\nYour landing page could use a few tweaks, especially considering the target audience.\n\n\\- Contrast of text and borders, some places its too harsh, other places text lacks a bit of contrast.\n\n\\- Your pricing cards have a different border radius than the container below it. Their border color is also really bright, I know you're probably drawing attention, but you're drawing attention to the border, which is not your intention I believe.\n\n\\- Your background is pure black (0,0,0). This is almost never a good idea. In your case, there is color in your overall palette, I would advise to use a very dark background in that same palette. Attached screenshot shows an example of adding some more color.\n\n\\- There's some awkward line heights, paddings and typography, nothing terrible, but as an example, I've touched up your 3 steps a bit to illustrate the difference, the same thing happens in a few places.\n\n\\- Typo: \"*UiBun gives you* ***THE*** *ability to import*\"\n\n\\- Typo: \"*Try all features fo free.*\"\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/rPF02Cj](https://imgur.com/a/rPF02Cj)\n\n\\^ These are for illustrative purposes and quickly done through dev tools!\n\n  \nedit: One last thing, your copy often reeds like you couldn't get it out there quick enough and were more concerned with how many lines it was to fit your design than whether it brings the point across or entices customers to act. Give it the attention it deserves.\n\nSteve Krug's \"Don't make me think\" is a great little book to pick up about effective design and copy, here's a bit from it that is relevant to my last remark: [https://blog.codinghorror.com/happy-talk-must-die/](https://blog.codinghorror.com/happy-talk-must-die/)\n\nDon't tell me I'll save time or be happy using your service, explain to me *how* you will do that.

        "selftext": "But perhaps I'm overcomplicating things.\n\nWarning: noob here. \\~5 min read time. Thank you in advance.\n\n\n\n# Good evening fellow developers 👋\n\n**TLDR: I need highly memory efficient backend solutions.**\n\nI have a small \"business?\" that doesn't generate enough revenue yet for me to be able to afford pricey cloud providers. After days of research, I've decided to go with a Hetzner Cloud VPS because I like self-hosting. Their cheapest one is CX22 (Intel 2 Core, 4GB RAM, 40GB SSD) for 4.51€/m.\n\nNow, I come from the C++ world so I'm overly obsessed with memory usage & performance, and I don't have much experience in web dev.\n\n\n\n# Current situation\n\n**(1)** I have a simple [Discord bot](https://fut.red/zip) (NodeJS) that stays online via a self-hosted GitHub actions runner & pm2 on an M1 MBP next to me, plugged into a power source 24/7. I know, this isn't a viable solution. On idle, the bot consumes over **100MB of RAM**, which is wild to me.\n\n**(2)** Next, I plan to create a blog with [GhostCMS](https://ghost.org) and a digital asset store with [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/). Both are super compelling because they are easy to set up and come with features out of the box that I don't have to code (analytics, email newsletter, text editor, integrations with platforms, etc). **The problem is that these tools alone need at least 2GB of RAM for running (in a docker container).**\n\nTotal: \\~2.1 GB.\n\n\n\n# My ideas\n\nYou see where this is going. After countless hours of looking in forums, watching YouTube tutorials, analyzing RAM usage graphs, I've decided to come to Reddit as a last resort. Here are the possible solutions that I went through.\n\n* Kotlin (+ ktor?). I like Kotlin, but I've read that it's a bit memory hungry (ktor, micronaut). Would honestly love to use it though! 🥇\n* Swift (+ Vapor?). Also a solid option. But do people even use that on the server side? I'm on macOS, so it would be beneficial to transfer that knowledge over when writing apps. 🥈\n* C++ (+ drogon?). The language I spent the most time with, so I'm a bit biased. Not sure if it's the right tool for the job, but definitely ticks all of the boxes except great DX. 🥉\n* Go. Good DX because it comes with all the tools needed for web dev. Don't like it due to it's syntax. Variable names are one letter. No semicolons. I heard error handling is a pain too.\n* Rust (+ actix?). Honestly considering it. But I heard it's hard to set up for web compared to Go.\n\nAlso:\n\n* HTMX for front-end. It has a different approach and gets combined with Go. I like its simplicity.\n* [Coolify](https://coolify.io) to tie it all together. Super compelling Vercel alternative for managing auto-deployments in a GUI. Pro: I never have to touch docker. Con: you guessed it, it needs an even more powerful VPS. Does that mean I'll need to learn K8S for auto deploying from GitHub?\n* SQLLite. Are there other (managed OSS) databases you'd recommend?\n\n\n\nBesides that, I have used NextJS but I think it gets hyped a lot on YouTube? There are countless tutorials on it. They introduce a breaking change every year. App dir? Src dir? Where is pages? And now caching is broken? Edge wasn't real? Turbopack is better than webpack?\n\nBecause of this, I chose Astro + Cloudflare pages to host the frontend for my blog back then. Simple, lightweight.\n\n\n\n# So, what's the problem? You'll be fine with a memory usage of under 3GB with your current situation. That's true, but:\n\nFirstly, I'd like to drop in other services as well in the future — I've heard Grafana and Prometheus are good for monitoring, so they'll eat up even more resources. Also, I heard about New Relic that I'd like to try it out. I haven't even decided on a database. Maybe put a mail server there as well? Oh, and what about Sentry for error logging? (they recommend 16 GB 🤯)\n\nSecondly, I believe in minimizing footprint before upgrading hardware. It's easy to scale and call it a day. But in my opinion, we should be mindful of our resource consumption and try to solve things on the software-level first, by choosing the right tools. Just because you have access to so much RAM, doesn't mean you should be wasting all of this precious hardware. Simplicity over complexity.\n\n\n\n# Bottom line\n\nSo, what should I do? Code a CMS with any of the mentioned languages by myself? Not sure if I have the time for that. [My current blog](https://news.futureblur.com) uses [Astro starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), but non-devs can't add to it because there is no visual editor. It's just .md files in the GitHub repo. No CMS system. And as mentioned, I'll also need to rewrite the Discord bot in a more efficient language.\n\n\n\nI'm not learning to get a job, so I don't really care whether that particular solution is widely adopted in the industry. Is it time for me to move over to Framer? I'm a just 3D artist with some web dev needs.\n\nAnd does anyone else have experience with similar requirements to mine, or am I the only one who thinks about this? Are there any language + framework combinations that I have missed, which could be very well optimized to be incredibly low on the memory?\n\nI would really, really appreciate if anyone with experience could give me some guidance. Thank you!",

How much of it is Discord’s libraries (and their dependencies) vs your code? If you need help understanding how to profile Node and learn JS performance optimization tricks, I highly recommend two courses on Frontend Masters: [Blazingly Fast JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/blazingly-fast-js/) by ThePrimeagen and [Bare Metal JavaScript: The JavaScript Virtual Machine](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-cpu-vm/) by Miško Hevery.\n\nThere are lots of successful businesses built with Laravel (PHP) running on $5 Digital Ocean instances. So I think your assessment and concerns around memory usage are unfounded based on your needs.\n\nPersonally, I would start with whatever technologies get you up and running the fastest. Then you can observe your service in the real world and migrate hotspots to more optimal implementations.\n\nWrt CMS, have you looked at Netlify CMS / Decap CMS? It’s free, git based, easy to hook up, and provides a UI. https://decapcms.org/docs/intro/",

                "body": "Here are my general thoughts.  \n\n* All the out-of-the-box solutions are usually resource wasteful.  \n* Writing your own discord bot from scratch that takes basically no resources is definitely within the realm of things you can do in any language with a good websocket library. That does not mean it is the best way for you to spend your time.  \n* Writing your own CMS is a lot harder and more time consuming. This is almost certainly not worth your time to make.  \n* Pretty much all languages can be used in a light-weight manner. It is mostly the stack of libraries people throw on top where the bloat comes from. I would personally recommend Go, because the DX is just great. Go's position on syntax is also actually amazing. Because Go's position is '*syntax doesn't matter, here's a formatter so everyone's code looks the same*\". Error handling is not hard, in fact it is much easier than languages that use throw exceptions, but people don't like it because there is some repetition involved.\n* Regarding database choice, SQLite is fine and lightweight. It works well unless you have thousands of concurrent users (you don't). The obvious alternative would be postgres.  \n* Do you actually need a CMS? Or could you arrive at a decent solution with something like a simple static site generator? \n* Regarding your last question if anyone has similar requirements. We don't actually know. You have told us very little about the problem you're trying to solve, but a lot about how you're trying to solve it. You could very well be having an [XY problem](https://xyproblem.info/).",

I highly doubt many of the downvoters are experienced full stack devs in leadership roles. I recently spoke to a senior engineer at a large enterprise SaaS that said they're rebuilding their admin apps entirely in low code, because the savings is so high.\n\nYou want a profitable business, you gotta focus on customers, not how pretty your admin app tables are.\n\nUI Bakery isn't as feature rich as Retool, although they are moving at a crazy pace. I like it better mainly out of preference, but you should compare them, Retool, and others based on what features are most important to you. E.g. UI Bakery just very recently added cursor based pagination; it has been a bit of extra work up to now without it, Retool had them beat on that.",

I told them I thought that was steep, only because the system is already built out, they just need to customize it. \n\nI wanted to see what a custom-built site like this would run... I know it'd be more expensive than that, but I have told them that their service might be better suited to a custom build than just a plugin. \n\nIf you were presented a job like this, what would be the price quote and time requirement? You can go over with a time estimate too. The current site is now wordpress, they haven't started a community, so there's no transferring over, and there is an option to make it a separate domain, where the users login to their custom learning platform. They are currently building the course out, writing and recording content, so nothing is finalized. Marketing is within HighLevel and would need to be integrated, along with their email marketing to trigger specific actions (sign up, check out, forgot password, event reminders, etc). \n\nFeel free to ask any questions - I look forward to your perspectives!",

        "author": "bunzelburner",
        "id": "1ij858a",
        "selftext": "My extended family owns and operates a grocery/meat/deli/catering business in the United States. They have about 100 employees and do quite a bit of volume through both the meat market and catering portion of the business. They have for a long time been using Quickbooks as their invoicing system and then basterdizing it so to speak to work as a catering management system as well. The one real issue they have with it is that Quickbooks truncates details of an invoice so really the only way they can share the information with different departments is printing it out.\n\nThree of my uncles are heavily involved in the business, one of them being the outright owner. Another manages the kitchens, another handles invoicing and scheduling catering. The one who handles invoicing decided to take it upon himself to find an alternative to using Quickbooks. Without apparently doing much or any due diligence he decided to have an application custom built that would function as a replacement for Quickbooks and also collect customer payments and serve as a catering management application. Furthermore, he is having it built using AppSheet (Google's no-code app platform). The desired functionality goes beyond what AppSheet is really capable of so it is being extended using Google Apps Scripts. On top of all of this it is being built by 2-3 developers in Argentina. I should add in here that this uncle has no experience with development of any kind. About $20k have been spent developing it so far and basically no one at the business has seen it, tested it, or been consulted on how it should work.\n\nI do not work for the business, but as a computer engineer and full stack developer, my other two uncles have asked me to weigh in on what's going on. I met with all three of them earlier this week, and without even bringing up the possibility of abandoning it, he already started to get his back up and made comments along the lines that \"we're not going back\", \"we're doing a custom application\", \"everyone is doing custom applications at companies these days\", and \"it's written in a common language, AppSheet, so any developer could easily support it.\"\n\nThe only positive outcome of the meeting is that he agreed to allow me to \"help\" with the development so as to gain access to the code and take a deeper look.\n\nI have already expressed to my other 2 uncles that I do not think this is a wise approach. Some concerns that have been identified by myself and them include:\n\n* It is largely untested and because of that there remains to be a significant period of testing and troubleshooting\n* Building off of that, this is a system that is intended to replace everything (invoicing software, scheduling software, payment portals, customer ordering) - if it goes down, even for a little bit on the wrong day - they're fucked\n* AppSheet does not handle large volumes of data quickly (it natively uses a google spreadsheet as a database). I threw together a payment portal for him for it and fetching data from it took anywhere from 8-20 seconds.\n* There is no support system in place. The uncle doing all of this seems convinced we can just find a local guy to help maintain it. I assured them that would likely not be cheap and they are then looking at exposing their entire system including payment processing and customer info to whoever that is.\n* From a liability standpoint, if it goes down, I feel like they might be screwed. Generally businesses who have a loss of business will get insurance reimbursement if it was outside of their control (power company fucks up as opposed to faulty wiring in the building). This I feel would not be outside of their control\n* General maintenance and support. They have started to switch some of the database data to an SQL database instead - but he isn't even aware of where that SQL database is. I told him that while that's great, it adds another layer that needs to be monitored and maintained.\n\n**What I'm hoping to get from anyone here is additional concerns you see with all of this that I can take to them.** It's a sticky situation being family and we can't just pull the rug out from under him. We're trying to find a way to ease him into the idea that this is not a good idea. Unfortunately it will probably end badly owing to the fact he acts like he knows way more than he actually does. I've already resigned myself to the fact I probably won't be going to family Christmas anymore after the dust settles and I'm okay with that.\n\nI feel like they will be making their lives way more difficult than it needs to be given the numerous solutions out there. Of course if you think I'm wrong, please share as well.",

        "author": "giantskyman",
        "id": "1iblpzq",
        "selftext": "Hi r/webdev\n\nTLDR: If you're looking to escape triangle company and are frustrated with AWS console, try out https://www.thunder.so\n\nI run a web app shop and I have built hundreds of web apps for clients with React/Next.js, Astro and Vue/Nuxt. My go-to choice has been Vercel and AWS Amplify for the last few years for deployments.\n\nWhile I adore triangle company for their UX, their pricing has left me and my clients frustrated. I have sites that cost $1000+/month to run which are basically static server pre-rendered pages. The bandwidth, the image optimization, etc. end up costing a lot at scale.\n\nSo I ended up transferring a lot of sites to Amplify, which reduces costs by between 60 and 70%, but it introduced an array of issues: poor UX, slow builds and a whole bunch of things I don't need getting in the way. Configuring and fine-tuning an app across a bunch of AWS products is extremely time consuming. The DevOps work ends up costing more than the monies saved.\n\nAnd as always, managing multiple teams, multiple accounts and multiple zones in AWS console remained a frustration.\n\nI started a home-grown CDK stack that:\n- hosts static resources in an S3 bucket, \n- serve the site using CloudFront CDN, \n- git push triggers a build pipeline (with CodeBuild and CodePipeline) and invalidates CDN cache.\n\nThe code can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/thunder-so/cdk-spa\n\nYou can drop a TS file in your project with 10 lines of code and you have hosting sorted.\n\nAbout a year ago, I started to build an interface using Vue/Nuxt + tRPC and the TS AWS SDK. \n\nThe purpose of this project is to provide the smooth UX of Vercel for modern web application developers who are on the AWS platform. Fine tuned for cost savings, performance and security. The best of both worlds.\n\nI believe an open web requires an open source PaaS that instead of fleecing its customers by reselling AWS, helps them save money instead. \n\nToday, I am launching the MVP. Core features:\n\n- Manage multiple AWS accounts\n- Deploy any app / environment in any region\n- Thorough integration with Github \n- Manage environment variables\n- Manage redirects and rewrites at the edge \n- Manage domains and certificates with Route53 and ACM \n\nAs of today, I have tested:\n\n- React +  Vite\n- Vue + Vite\n- Svelte + Vite\n- Preact + Vite, \n- Astro SSG\n- Next.js Static export\n\nAlso works with any JS/TS static site generator (SSG) like Gatsby, VuePress, VitePress, Docusaurus etc. The MVP supports SPA/SSG sites only at the moment.\n\nNext, I will ship support for SSR (with streaming) from Lambda. I am currently working on a 3-Lambda architecture for Nuxt, Astro (and probably even Next.js) which will handle image optimizations, middlewares, edge functions.\n\nGradually, the product aims to replicate Vercel's core functionality using open source CDK/SDK constructs.\n\nThe product is in beta and I have been dogfooding for about a month and things seem stable enough for a public announcement. \n\nCheck it out: https://www.thunder.so\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you try out the app. Feedback, bug reports and contributions most appreciated.",

If you are <50 employees and websites are not your core business, you should probably be looking at some internal organizational tools within an existing service. You could do what you are describing with the google office suite and a PM tool like Trello on its free tier. Or lots of other scheduling tools and quite few other PM tools some of which might even exist in an industry specific fashion. Meaning there may be project management software specifically for manufacturing and that would be worth looking into. \n\nBut don't try and add a layer of complexity to document storage and basic communications. That's a boondoggle with no happy ending for you or anybody else. There's a reason the word \"intranet\" doesn't show up as much as it used to. Except for a few specific use cases in large orgs, an internal website is both overkill and underkill - meaning it is too hard to maintain and does not deliver the same value as external services and known tools.",

Filtering, sorting, merchandising, and marketing all become much easier and more powerful when every color variant is its own product (assuming your customers shop by color - if not color, replace this with the variant option that drives the purchase decision). \n\nAdditionally, because so many people shop on their phones and just endlessly scroll, you’re enabling collection/PLP pages to show every single color variant, which increases conversion. \n\nThe downside is that you have to heavily customize the PDP/product page experience. \n\nWhen variants are products, if you want a high-converting PDP, you need to recreate the product-with-variants UX on the PDP, so that all the possible options for a product style are together on one PDP (in our case, color and size).\n\nIdeally, you want to do this with state management, so that you’re not reloading the page or navigating to a new page when “variants” are clicked. This is complex to build and maintain, but if you examine very high-performing retail e-commerce sites, especially in apparel, they are almost all organized this way.",

With this, a big challenge I foresee is how the PM/sales people like Strapi because they can stick data into it before any UI is built in a reasonably simple (albeit ugly) way. They obviously don't care about the code or suffering that Strapi causes, because so long as \"it works\" it's fine.\n\nSo I'm trying to find a tool, platform, preferebly self hosted, I can give an ORM artifact (don't care if it's a prisma file, .ts with decorators, .proto or whatever), and it can auto generated a somewhat \"sane\" Crud Web portal to allow data management.\n\nI'm fully aware of: \n- this is not a simple problem, and it's asking allot\n- Strapi has a kinda ORM-esque thing with their json content-type\n- I can build Crud APIs super quick with nest\n- any tool, regardless of the ORM, will not be able to infer custom validation logic that actual code may enforce\n- I could use a low-code tool like base row, app smith, nocodb and so forth to build UI reasonably quickly, this being their general domain \n- I could give a lesson in dbeaver or robo3t (or whatever it's been renamed to)\n\nThank you for all the help. \n\n*Note:* before anyone asks, tried Strapi 5, didn't solve my pain points with 4, and though as a CRM it's fine, I personally don't enjoy using it as a base for anything really, and if I ever get the mental capacity and courage to put myself out there I might do a write up one day of my list of grievances with it",

        "author": "stormthulu",

        "selftext": "I've been using Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet as my primary AI assistant. It's far from perfect, which is true of all of the AI tools. However, it is more useful than just the bog standard ChatGPT or Claude chat without the 'context' of projects. \n\nIf you haven't used it yet, I think the main benefit is that you can upload project knowledge (i.e. files) to the project, and then reference them during your chats. It's quite useful. \n\nTo get the most out of it, what I've been doing is keeping a simple markdown file that is a complete summary of my project. It is honestly a very useful tool even if I wasn't using an AI, because it's a solid tracker for all of my thoughts, current state of project, etc. \n\nHere are the sections in my current project document, for example:\n\n* Notes to the AI--things like 'stop apologizing when you make mistakes', 'don't edit this document', 'don't try and print the full contents of this document when I tell you to read it', 'reminder, I use fish shell, kitty, and yarn, so when you give me CLI instructions, use those tools'; basically, stuff that I noticed it was doing on the regular\n* Summary of Project (features, definition of terms, system functionality summary)\n* Architecture Overview\n* Epics & Features, broken down by platform (i.e. user platform, administration platform, marketing website)\n* Key Decisions\n* Completed Tasks\n* To-Do / Next Steps\n* Outstanding Questions / Issues / Concerns\n* Dev Tooling (frontend frameworks and packages, backend frameworks and packages, unit/integration/e2e testing, dev environment, hosting / production / devops, project management tools\n* Database Tables (outline of each table--its purpose, outstanding questions, and list of columns)\n* Database Structure\n   * A database seeding plan--i.e. a list of what should go into each table in a seed file, so that the seed file creates a fully representative database, in terms of platform functionality\n   * Database Table Structures--each table, the column in each table, the type of data in that column (consistent with the database I'm using--in my case, sqlite), the default value for the column, whether the column is required or optional, and other notes about the column--date/time format, uniqueness, stuff like that\n   * Indexes, Triggers, Row Level Security, and Policies--what it says on the tin, a list of all additional indexes that need to be created, triggers for things like the updated\\_at column, row level security, and policies regarding which type of user can access which types of data, and what they can do with it (read, write, delete, update)\n* Project Directory Tree / Structure; this is useful for the AI to see what the current file/folder structure is, what files already exist, etc. \n\nAnyway--what I found was, whenever I started a new chat, even within the Claude Projects structure, the AI would lose knowledge of our previous chat. So, this document allows me to provide that. I simply keep timestamps when I update the document, and then every time I update it, I delete the old copy, upload the new copy.\n\nThen, when I start a new chat in the project (you can't run a single long chat, it starts to consume your usage faster, the longer a chat gets), the first paragraph of the chat is me telling Claude to review the document, and if I need it to pay attention to a particular section, I point that section out. \n\nI don't know if this is useful to anyone or not, but I've found it to be incredibly useful. It also has helped me to formulate my thoughts and decisions in a more formal manner than just \"going at it\" and building out the project, because it means I have to think about what I want to do, and write it down, instead of just winging it.

The latter is not even possible on Squarespace—when you upload a 12 MP photo to a gallery, it gets downsampled to 1-2 MP and there's no way to view the original-resolution file. Nor can I link the original resolution file to that gallery preview. \n\nI need a platform where I can control the entire website structure (individual HTML pages and media), ideally with local file system access via FTP or similar. My goal is to use Python scripts to automate tasks like generating new galleries/web pages, uploading images, and linking previews inside a gallery to full-resolution files (Squarespace forcibly downsamples images and the full-res versions are inaccessible to the end user).\n\nWhat platforms would you recommend for this level of customization? Note that I do prefer a WYSIWYG editor so that I'm not spending hours setting stuff up from scratch, but when I need to do more powerful things like change sections across all my photo galleries, I want the option for stuff like multi-file regex replacements across all my galleries' HTML files. \n\nI’m considering WordPress with a hosting company but would love to hear your thoughts, since I'm fairly new to non-WYSIWYG web development tools.

The favicon, logo, CSS files, fonts, images, directly downloadable files, etc. are all files inside this website’s folder and any webpage that uses that file will link to it internally (e.g. `path/to/photo.png`). Unless they’re being linked externally, in which case it doesn’t need to be saved and can be linked directly to `example.com/photo.png`. \n\nTo my knowledge *any* website builder is just helping you to create the HTML files and upload the images more easily without having to directly write the HTML/CSS code or interact directly with the file system and upload photos, no matter if it’s WP, Squarespace, or something else. And some editors like Squarespace don’t allow you to see those HTML files, only certain assets like uploaded photos and the favicon, whereas some like WP allow a lot more freedom and do allow you to see the entire file system (?). \n\nAt least this is all stuff I am basing off of what learned almost a decade ago when learning about HTML. Also whenever I save a webpage in Safari or Google chrome, that websites or web pages have that structure as well, so it seems to add up. \n\nIs my idea of a website outdated?

Has anyone implemented similar setups, or can recommend a tech stack or library that might best meet these requirements?\n\nAny insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Connected accounts should be able to manage their payments (e.g., issuing refunds) through the platform, and ideally, the sellers will cover the Stripe fees.\n\nI’ve configured the following settings:\n\n* **Hosted onboarding**\n* **None** (for allowing connected accounts to manage their payments and account details)\n* **Direct charge type**\n* **Connected accounts pay fees**\n\nI’m fairly confident these settings are correct. However, I’m a bit confused about one thing: in the Stripe dashboard, the payment status shows as “paused soon,” and it requires sellers to upload documents for verification.

        "selftext": "As the title suggests, Im looking for a way to easily host web apps.  \nThis setup is not a requirement of the app, simply I want to practice coding in an environment like this. Please do not suggest a 'simpler' architecture.  \nI could (and have) used AWS with Terraform to create all resources I need with EC2 or EKS or ECS and all that. While this was great practice on the DevOps side, I am not looking for all that complexity on every web app where I want to try something out.\n\nWhat I'm trying to achieve: \n\n* Hosting a full stack multi-container web app that requires minimal infrastructure effort and is relatively low cost. It is a Java Spring Boot API and a React frontend and they're different Docker containers.\n* SSL certificate and a publicly available domain where the app is reachable.\n* Some sort of reverse proxy to route traffic to the containers.\n* Monitoring, logging, secret management.\n* Easy deployments.\n\nSooo basically everything other than the app logic itself.\n\nWhat I've tried so far and why it did not work out for me.\n\n* AWS(GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean etc..) : As I mentioned, it is quite cumbersome to set up and maintain. More complexity then what I am looking for. I've done it this way so I do understand the principles, but not what I want to spend my time on now.\n* [Fly.io](http://Fly.io), Render, Heroku etc.. : These are almost there but still not quite. They all lack one of the functionalities mentioned above and found them not to be a very good fit for this type of apps.\n* [MightyMoud](https://github.com/MightyMoud)/[**sidekick**](https://github.com/MightyMoud/sidekick) : This comes really close. I love that you can run it on any VPS and ticks almost all boxes, except it's for single container apps :(\n\nWhat would you suggest?  \nI have a fear that this architecture is just complex enough that I either do it all myself on AWS or make it simpler in order to be easy to host on the other platforms. But I can also imagine that there is something I don't see and you can help me out.  \nCheers 👋 ",

        "author": "PowerShellGenius",
        "id": "1evoqn5",
        "selftext": "Passkeys are supposed to be a universal standard.  It's not on the website to worry about how they are stored.  There are 3 equally legitimate ways to use them.\n\nIt's legitimate to require a higher security (non-synced) method for high security needs, and block lower security methods - that is not what I'm fussing about.  There are legitimate use cases (admin rights to a cloud tenant, etc) where it's legit for a dev to only support Passkeys on external FIDO2 security keys, for example, and not support passkeys saved in a Google/Apple account.\n\nThe other way around, however, is ridiculous - there is no reason to ever *exclusively* support insecure passkey storage and block the most secure methods.  Nor do I think web devs intentionally do this.  However, many don't understand passkeys/WebAuthn well, and inadvertently do just this.\n\nOnly platform authenticators, handled in software by the browser or OS of the device on which the user is logging in - the least secure variety of passkey, while still far better than passwords - can be completely *silently enumerated* with any degree of reliability.  \"Conditional UI\" means these are the only ones that are usable.\n\nUsing a phone passkey on your PC requires your PC to know, under no uncertain terms, \"prompt the user for a passkey\" - since when it finds no passkey, it needs to bother the user to present the QR code to pair a phone & check there for passkeys.  *The user needed to be able to make your site try WebAuthn unconditionally for this to happen.*\n\nIf using a hardware security key, you need to use your PIN and tap your security key before it will even let you enumerate its contents, so the PC also needs to know, under no uncertain terms, \"we're trying to use a passkey\" so it prompts the user to do so, if their passkey is stored on a YubiKey or similar device (*the most secure means of passkey storage that exists)*.\n\nWhen you use **Conditional UI,** and present no button to force Modal UI, **what you are doing is instructing the user's browser \"only try WebAuthn if you can already know for sure, without bugging the user, that you have a passkey for this site\".**  *With 2 of the 3 passkey methods, the browser* ***can never know this***, because passkeys on hardware tokens & on other devices can't be enumerated without user interaction.\n\n**If you are implementing passkeys, please ensure there is a way in which your user can cause the** ***modal*** **WebAuthn UI during sign-in.  This will ensure all passkeys, including the most secure type of passkeys, are usable.**\n\nIt should also be noted that **Google has ulterior motives** for \"encouraging\" devs to use Conditional UI.  There is no bulk migration of passkeys between platforms without logging into every service and creating new ones. However, within the Google ecosystem, they sync to your next Android just fine.  Within the Apple ecosystem, they sync to your next iPhone/iPad just fine.  Only if they are on a third party password manager or a hardware security key do you own them *when you leave your current device platform*.\n\n**Conditional UI presses users to utilize** ***platform*** **passkeys** (in their Apple or Google account) only, which is the less secure type of passkey compared to hardware keys, but unlike hardware keys, it helps Google and Apple increase platform lock-in among their respective users.  Modal UI means all passkeys a user possesses, in any valid form, are usable.\n\nTL;DR there are bona fide reasons NOT to use \"Conditional UI\" exclusively.  Using it is fine, but also provide a \"sign in with a passkey\" button that kicks off the \"modal\" process when users who have passkeys registered on your site are signing in.  If their passkey is stored external to the device, they can't use it in autofill and need to be able to make their browser prompt for an external passkey.",

It adds nothing to your UI and just instructs the browser \"if you have a passkey for this site, present it like a password in your native AutoFill UI\".\n\nThat's great at the username step.  Keeps new things out of non-passkey-users' face, while letting some of the most common passkey providers still provide usernameless and passwordless auth via an AutoFill-like UI.\n\nBut it doesn't work for using passkeys the browser can't silently enumerate.  If no passkey for the site is present **on-device** or otherwise already known to the browser, Conditional UI gives the user no chance to use their passkey, whereas modal UI gives them a prompt to pair a phone or use a USB security key that has a passkey.\n\nRegardless of whether you support Conditional UI on the username screen, modal UI should be invokeable by a button on your password prompt screen if the username entered has passkeys registered.  If you want to be more pushy about using passkeys, you can invoke it upon submission of a username with no more clicks if the user logged in with a passkey last time (like Microsoft does).",

For a large share of users, they are 100% the best option.\n\nI'm saying that an open standard meant to be agnostic to how you store passkeys should not be modified based on assumptions that no one needs to store their passkey on an external device.  Open standards mean nothing if implementers are going to assume parts of it really aren't needed.  Cross-device use of passkeys from external devices is a core part of the standard aimed at ensuring passkeys are workable in every scenario.\n\nIn fact- by implementing in a way that breaks this, you indirectly ARE harming security.  If passkeys don't work for (as an example) my first sign-in on a new computer - via the \"use a passkey from another device\" QR code flow & my phone - ***that means passkeys don't really replace passwords and I still need a password-based login method.***  Only when passkeys are implemented in such a way you can depend on them for every login do they mean you can kill off weaker auth methods and really be more secure.

It's not really talking about the ability to migrate between systems. Otherwise we could claim that any vendor-specific commercial (paid) system is insecure because you lose access to it if you stop paying for it. Which obviously doesn't make sense.\n\n> I still need a password-based login method\n\nYou don't. You just need a magic link to login and set up a passkey on a new device. This is nothing new, magic links are an extremely popular form of account auth/recovery today and they work fairly well and minimize phishing attacks too (if done right, obviously).\n\nIn practice you are not really locked in by using passkeys with conditional UI, because all realistic account services offer a way to recover your account based on email or something similar.",

Look at NIST standards; platform passkeys are not the top assurance level, regardless of whether I, you, or anyone else on Reddit thinks the attacks on them are not realistic.  SOME places will always want hardware.\n\nThere is, on the other hand, NO reason to require a lower assurance level.  So you would think a person who has some accounts places that require a higher level, would be able to just put all their passkeys on the higher level authenticator (security key) if they want to keep things together.\n\nBut no, for no reason other than convenience, some sites won't cooperate with that.  Because god forbid we need space for a \"use your passkey\" button... stick with conditional UI to save a square inch of space, and block 2/3 of the legitimate standard ways to use passkeys (\"from another device\" and \"security key\") because you assume everyone uses the other 1 (\"on this device\") only.\n\nThe entire reason WebAuthn is a standard is so that you don't have to worry about things like this.  The one thing you can count on that never fails is for various large companies to butcher any interoperable standard until it's unrecognizable as one at all.  The purpose of a standard isn't for those implementing it to say \"here is what we think is a normal use of this standard, we are only implementing that\".

I'm also looking for a platform that allows for custom code or third-party integrations if needed.\n* **Scalability:** Since the business may grow, I want a CMS that can handle a large number of products, users, and transactions without significant performance issues.\n* **Community & Support:** A strong community and good support are crucial for troubleshooting and keeping the site running smoothly.\n* **Budget:** While I’m willing to invest in quality, cost-effectiveness is still a factor. A platform with reasonable licensing fees and add-on costs would be ideal.\n\nThanks in advance.",

If you were to host on AWS then you could utilize the different services (S3, EC2, RDS/DynamoDB) to contain it all within that ecosystem, but again, not necessary if you're already more comfortable with the other options you've listed. Just a few options for differentiated services are Vercel/Netlify for frontend + static assets, Railway/Render for backend, and Supabase/PlanetScale/Render for database.\n\nThe free tier for AWS lasts an entire year, and if it doesn't drive corporate-level traffic, the prices after the free tier expires should be manageable. Knowing various AWS services is definitely a great skill to have, but it can be counterintuitive at times. If it's more convenient to you because you already know some of these PaaS platforms, just go with them. If you want to learn how to use AWS/don't mind the learning curve and value containing all of your infrastructure in one service, go with that (Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, and DigitalOcean can act as alternatives for a single-provider solution).",

For this, I would recommend an object storage service like S3, Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean, or Backblaze as they all have solutions for object storage, and you can store the object metadata efficiently in your database should you choose. You can choose to self-host with NGINX/Apache, but unless you need a secure self-hosted environment and want to avoid cloud solutions at any cost, it's more management and work than it's worth. I would personally choose a VPS solution for this. Again, whether that VPS serves all your infrastructure needs is still up to you.",

        "author": "Born-Log1624",
        "id": "1htdegf",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nA friend and I from Germany/Switzerland are brainstorming an idea for a niche marketplace platform for collective orders. The platform would connect customers with sellers, offering features like dynamic pricing (not as complex as real-time changes like on the stock market, but adjusted based on the total order volume in the batch—e.g., three pricing tiers for low, medium, and high order quantities).\n\nOrders are triggered at different intervals depending on the product. For example, Product A might have weekly order batches, while Product B is processed every two weeks. Each order requires at least one customer to initiate it before others can join. As more customers add to the batch, the price decreases based on pre-negotiated pricing tiers, which are clearly displayed and available to all customers in advance.\n\nWe don't have any programming or web development experience (or know exactly what's needed for this kind of project). It's a unique idea within our niche, and we’re trying to figure out the best way to approach its development.\n\n**Some key features we envision:**\n\n* Different user accounts: Buyers and sellers (with verification) and admins (only us, managing the platform). Sellers should be able to define their offer (different products) and price scales.\n* A product catalog with filtering and sorting options (there will not be hundreds of products to start with, but rather around 20 that will be offered on the platform in total - but the platform should be expandable)\n* Automatic calculation of commissions (for us, the platform owners) with a clear overview provided for sellers about their transactions and earnings.\n* Basic communication tools (notifications, messaging for queries).\n* Potential for sustainability features in the future (e.g., tracking CO₂ footprints depending on the ordered products - the calculations are quite simple).\n* It would be great if it would be possible to replicate the concept/platform to other sectors without building everything from scratch again.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. How much would it typically cost to develop a platform like this (minimum viable product)?\n2. Would you recommend finding a freelancer, partnering with someone who has the skills, or hiring a development company? How complex is what we ask for?\n3. What should we keep in mind when planning such a project (e.g., potential challenges, scaling, etc.)?\n\nWe'd greatly appreciate your insights and recommendations!\n\nThanks in advance for helping two non-tech folks 😊",

I will try to help based on my knowledge.\n\nIf you want to keep things simple, and launch as fast as possible a MVP and then build forward, I suggest you to start from an existing open source project. Something that comes into my mind that has some sort of built-in shop front end and backoffice for managing orders, users, etc it's [https://sylius.com/](https://sylius.com/) . It's open soruce, it's based on PHP (the best language for such projects in my opinion) and has a lot of Symfony components in it. \n\nRegarding the hiring, it really depends on what you're aiming for. Think about the fact that after launch you will still need someone to maintain and develop new features. \n\nOn the long term, having your own small team of developers would be the best (and cheapest) solution.   \nIt's hard to build a team from zero if it's just the two of you and you are not backed by any investors or another company, so maybe starting with an outsourcing company would be the choice. I usually don't recommend people to hire solo freelancers because they tend to write code just for theirselves, and when someone must pick up where they left, it's 90 percent of the times a mess.  \n  \nMy suggestion is that you should try to well define your MVP first. Write the overall idea and then split it into smaller tasks / parts / modules, whatever you call it. Then, I suggest you to negociate in particular each task / module / part of it, rather than agreeing to a price/estimate \"as a whole\".\n\nRegarding the estimation of the process / project, I've just launched a software estimation tool exactly for non technical people so that they won't get double crossed when starting out new projects. Once you start the project, I think it will help you a lot. \n\nIf you want to know more about the tool or have any in-depth questions, feel free to DM me. \n\nI wish you both good luck !",

We are planning to apply for funding and need to provide an approximate figure for the platform’s development.\n\nThanks again for your time and input – it’s super helpful! 😊",

I'd really appreciate your insights on the following:\n\n1. What does maintenance typically include? Is it just ensuring the platform stays up and running, or does it also involve adding new features, making changes, and upgrading the UI?\n2. How do payment terms work for maintenance? Do clients usually pay upfront for a year of maintenance, trusting that the developers will take care of everything? Or is it a monthly payment structure?\n3. Have any of you encountered situations where clients haven't paid for ongoing maintenance? How did you handle that?",

I've been silently working on MyPodify, a unified podcasting platform that I started building out of frustration with having to juggle multiple tools for podcast production.\n\n**The Problem:**\nCurrently, podcasters need to use different platforms for:\n- Planning (notion/sheets)\n- Recording (Zencastr/Riverside)\n- Editing (Descript/Audacity)\n- Distribution (Anchor/PodBean)\n- Analytics (Chartable/various platforms)\n\n**What my vision for MyPodify is:**\nA single platform that handles the entire podcast lifecycle:\n\n1. 📝 Planning & Content Management\n   - Episode idea bank\n   - Content calendar\n   - AI-powered topic suggestions\n   - Collaborative planning\n\n2. 🎙️ Production Suite\n   - Script writing with AI assistance\n   - Recording studio (local & remote)\n   - Multi-track editing\n   - Built-in sound library\n\n3. 📊 Post-Production & Distribution\n   - One-click multi-platform publishing\n   - Audiogram generation\n   - Cross-platform analytics\n   - Monetization tools\n\n**Current Status:**\n- ✅ Planning module (80% MVP complete)\n- 🔨 Working on pre-production features\n- 📋 Production & distribution modules planned\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- Next.js\n- Firebase\n- FastAPI for BE and Google Pub/Sub\n- Various integrations planned, such as Google Calendar, Spotify and Apple Podcasts to start with\n\nI'm building this because I believe podcast creation should be more streamlined. While there are great tools like Descript and Spotify for Podcasters, they each solve only part of the puzzle.\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n1. When do you think would be a good time to release MVP? Since it's supposed to be an All-in-one platform, I don't want it to be unusable as is when released as MVP.\n2. What features would make you switch from your current tools?\n\n**3. Any podcast creators here interested in early testing?**\n\nWill keep posting updates as I make progress.\n\nAny feedback, feature suggestions, or general thoughts would be super helpful!",

But by then I already had a network, clients willing to be referrals and clients who would send leads my way because they knew other people who needed a website with a CMS.\n\nIf you’re working alone, try reaching out to local agencies and offer freelance services. Reach out to local businesses - but do your research first - let them know what you have experience with and how you can help them. When I first started out WP was just another tool, I also worked on Joomla, Drupal and Mambo sites in addition to still working on static sites - it didn’t matter much, all were built on the same tech stack so I could decently navigate them all even if they worked slightly differently. Also involve yourself in your local WP community if there is one, or in one close by.\n\nThe contracts I work on now are mostly for larger orgs, sometimes they have an old website (WordPress or other) they need to rebuild, or they have a public tender out (we have people at the company scouring for tenders and responding to those that fits our company).",

        "selftext": "TL:DR\nI lost $60 in project fees and 3 days of work for nothing.\nI decided to stop working with him because he asked me to do something that was technically not feasible and wasn’t cooperative.\nThe worst part? Freelancer platform doesn’t pay you back for project fees you have to pay upfront when starting. FULL STORY 👇\n\nFor some context, I was running an experiment on Freelancer for my new app called okupdate, it’s an app helping clients and developers share project updates and generate reports automatically to avoid work disruptions, endless calls, meetings and back-and-forth messages.\n\nI built this for myself because I realized clients and devs are not speaking the same language, clients can be non technical and devs can struggle to explain complex stuff in simple language, so I was looking for a way to bridge the gap between the two and started to build a simple app in 10 minutes, posted on Reddit and my post got some decent traction so I thought it was a good idea but only started development months later because I was busy with other work.\n\nAs a second time founder you know how bad your product and distribution was on your first attempt so you’re thinking about the distribution first before building anything. When you scratch you own itches usually other people have the same problem so I thought about something I read in a book about platforms, one good way to build a new platform is to make something existing platforms don’t have and find a way to sneak your product in the platform in order to hijack their users. \n\nTo verify my theory I decided to run an experiment on Freelancer, and hire devs to not only test my app but help them get more clients by doing so. It’s simple, before sending a proposal to a project, a freelancer will also create a project on okupdate and share an invitation link to this project\n\nThe hypothesis (which happened to be true in my case) is that regardless of the freelancer’s profile strength, they could increase their chances of winning a job by providing a detailed project breakdown as a lead magnet from within their proposal. The experiment is still running and I’m always looking for participants so if you’re interested, reply to this thread and I will contact you. I will publish the results from this experiment once I have sufficient data to determine if this app has potential or not but for now let’s talk about this stupid client who ruined my entire week.\n\nI used to work on Upwork and Fiverr but Freelancer is better for this experiment because there’s more transparency so while running the experiment with other devs, I decided to be part of the experiment myself, after all, this is a way for me to test both the client and dev side of the platform. So I searched for jobs and bid on few projects until I found one who was French like me and was looking for a French dev specifically.\n\nI knew I had good chances since after checking the existing proposals I saw no French guy in the list but I still included my invitation link (lead magnet) in my proposal and sponsored it just in case. Fast forward next day the client reaches out to me and says good things upfront about the okupdate tool and joined the platform, we talked the whole morning about the requirements and eventually I optimized my time estimate to 5 days/1 week for project completion.\n\nWe get started, all good (so far), project setup, database schema, homepage. For all these tasks I use okupdate to automatically update the client about the project progress. Every time I push a task, completion circle increases as shown in the image. That’s the only feature working for now since I’m looking to verify if freelancers can get new clients (and new clients for me) before I dive into more development and useless features.\n\nThe client provided me with some code that was completed at 90% for the next task (remember this for the end of the story).\nI got started and eventually I ran into a problem. We used an API to fetch data from new crypto ETH tokens, the client wanted to retrieve the wallet of the user creating the token and the wallet from the first transaction.\n\nThe problem faced was that from one request to another, we couldn’t with 100% accuracy get reliable data to show on the app. Sometimes data was missing, sometimes data was found, but at different unpredictable positions in the data array. I got stuck checking back and forth with crypto exchanges to see whether the address was matching or not and wasted the whole day. To fix this problem and advance further in the project with reliable data to work with, I made a proposition to the client. It was simply to add an edit button on the wallet to check manually if the data fetched was actually reliable or not before saving it in the database. For me that was a measure of precaution because even if the data fetched is reliable, you can never expect 100% accuracy, stuff breaks sometimes. \n\nThe client refused categorically, saying that it was useless if he had to do check himself, yeah like it takes literally 3 seconds. Bro didn’t want to use his own app lmao. Anyway I realized this client made no concession whatsoever, starting from the price, I was being generous because I wanted some feedback on my app on the client side but I decided it was not worth it to continue working with people like that who have no respect for you and treat you like a slave.\n\nYou might ask what was horrible? The fact that he was constantly sending messages and interrupting me like a micro-managing manager who can’t help but inspect every detail of your work, making comments but without having a clue of what you’re doing. Despite the fact that I provided him with a tool to track my progress, it looks like that wasn’t enough for him, bro can’t help bossing around, I say this because I heard his voice over Telegram and I swear it was the voice of a self-satisfied and insufferable person. \n\nMoral of the story: Not only you pay for what you get when hiring freelancers but you also never get hired by cheap clients, they are literally the worse clients to work with because they will ask you so much for pretty much nothing in return.\n\nIf you are a freelancer developer looking for clients and want to participate in the okupdate experiment, reply below and I’ll contact you in DM with the step-by-step process to help you get started as a freelance developer or get more clients if you’re already an established freelancer but struggle to secure deals because of high competition and difficult economic time",

I would like to know if there is another better alternative to [WordPress.org](https://Wordpress.org), so I won t be forced to move later (like I am doing right now with WIX).\n\nB.  In my research, I found out about DreamHost, BlueHost and SiteGround. I didn t have any interaction with DreamHost, so I ll talk about the other two:\n\nBlueHost has insanely low prices, but the 36 months term they force upon myself scare me. They also don t offer \"Free domain privacy\" unless you purchase the more expensive plan of theirs. Although, I don t think I need it, because I am from Europe and GDPR. I also don t quite understand the difference between \"WordPress Hosting\" and \"Managed WordPress Hosting.\" The customer care representative told me that the \"Managed\" one is for traffic heavy sites.\n\nSiteGround I like more. I like their site better and the overall impression they gave me, but the prices are a little too steep and I do not know if they are worth it. I saw dozens of reviews that say it s the best choice for a [WordPress.org](https://WordPress.org) site.\n\nI would like to have full control over my website and be able to migrate it if I feel like it. Although friendly and pretty, WIX is so closed in and slow. They customer care is not that great, even tho they helped with everything I needed (except one time when they removed my Google SEO Token without my consent). WIX also charges a lot (290 euros for a premium plan, a mailbox and I didn t put in the site domain).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you decide to let my topic stay, thank you for your help!

I had some good reasons for this:\n\n1. you cant unsend  an email, this creates a lot of stress about making mistakes I rather  not deal with\n2. email HTML is (used to be?) a complete nightmare\n3. having to deal with spam blocking and making sure the mail is actually  delivered is a tricky topic, as well.\n4. I rather not store any emails (sensitive data) in the CMS and rather not deal with consent.\n\nNow  I have a client who is looking for an automatically generated email solution and I thought maybe it's a good time to take another look at this. They're tired of copy-pasting from the cms to mailchimp.\n\nThey want to compose their own emails from content taken from the existing website CMS. It's in three separate languages and also with a segmented list.\n\n1. can be solved with the client authoring their own emails.\n2. can be solved with  something like [https://mjml.io/faq](https://mjml.io/faq)\n3. can be solved by using a transactional email  provider, such as mailjet or mandrill\n4. (& 5)  I'm not sure - it would be great if the mails can stay in mailchimp/campaign monitor, etc. That would mean I have to tie myself to one solution, and this is something I'm hoping to avoid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat  experiences and recommendations do you have with this? I'm using  processwire (php) as backend since many years. Every now and then I look  for alternatives, but so far I don't have a better alternative.\n\nHow do you go about authoring? Would you build a preview function yourself?\n\nHow  do you deal with list management? For example, if you have a segmented  list in mailchimp, I suppose there must be a way to send to these  segments, for example?\n\nFor a  newsletter, is it better to use Mailchimp templates and programmatically  fill them, than to build your own templates? The drawback is that I tie  myself to them, this is something I hope to avoid.\n\nThis  is all a bit new to me so I'm not sure I'm even asking the right  questions, but I suppose for my particular case I have in front of me,  it would be something in between a regular mailchimp newsletter and a  transactional email.\n\nthanks!",

The thing is many of those sites being built on those platforms I have noticed (say on WordPress), they are not that good or offer any quality structure options, also they can get quite complex.\n\nSo, I was wondering does custom coded CMS has any demand? How much would you pay for it?\n\nI perfectly understand that developing a CMS with pure code from scratch is quite difficult and takes a lot of time (possibly even more than a month), since I have coded my own CMS lately. But I am still curious, just conducting some small market research here.\n\nDo you find that service of any value and what's a reasonable price, you would spend for a decent, custom to your needs, CMS platform.\n\nDecent meaning: You can update and edit certain sections of the website without code. Database to store data,  User Authentication, Dashboard with website & page info, posts, views, likes, analytics and statistics, geographical user data. Blog-post editor, users board, settings. You can have schedule posts. etc.\n\nEdit: A website builder and CMS are different things. In this case, I am not talking about building websites with a CMS, just modify the content with it. Platforms like WordPress are CMS & Website builders. The idea here is: you hire someone to build you a website, and on top of it they build you a dashboard to control the content in your uniquely designed website. The architecture, structure, layout of the website will never change. You will only be able to modify the content presented on certain parts, see analytics and other stuff. No building.",

The only issue being that Indian clients, especially at the startup stages are less paying than the normal market standards. My first ever client which I got from an Indian startup subreddit was for a meagre 25 USD. I'm not complaining as I had only 2-3 sites on my portfolio at that time, and he did give me referral to a client from which I charged around 40 USD. These offered me a good stepping stones for my next client (charged around 95 usd) and now I'm charging over 100 dollars and got immensely better at this thing. But because of my \"high\" rates in the Indian ecosystems, I have very few frequency of the clients coming in and also some do not end up publishing the site because the tech stack that I use i.e Framer, costs monthly plans which are sometimes unaffordable for my clients. I have decided to skip Indian clients and focus on international clients.\nTried Fiverr and Upwork, but the hyper competitive landscape there is killing me. I apply to a job every month on upwork through the monthly free connects that I get, but I manage to get no responses so far. I do think that my portfolio is decent and the websites I make are also pretty decent looking but ofcourse, I strive to make it better and upskill myself. I also tried cold emailing a few companies with their website revamps but got no reply. I also find this process to be unproductive as you're spending your time for revamping someone's website who might not need a revamp for a bunch of reasons, also it's unnecessary expenditure for them as most people think in the terms of \"it's okay as long as it's functioning\" and give lesser regards to design and ux. It's also hard to determine what they actually need or what their vision with the website is without even talking to them. Plus it's also difficult to determine if they would be willing to change their current tech stack.\nI have tried several different ways to find clients but have been unsuccessful in a lot of them so far.\n\nSo how and where do I actually find clients?",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow developers,\n\nI’ve been working with Astro for creating websites and love its performance benefits and DX. However, I'm facing challenges with the client handoff process, especially when compared to more integrated platforms like Webflow, Framer, or WordPress.\n\n**Here’s the scenario:** When building websites with platforms like WordPress, Webflow,  etc., the handoff is straightforward — I simply transfer the project to the client's account, and they have everything in one place to manage and make updates as needed. **HOWEVER**, with Astro and most likely other modern frameworks, the process seems fragmented and potentially overwhelming for clients, especially small to medium-sized businesses.\n\nFor instance, to fully hand over a project:\n\n* Clients need a GitHub account for version control.\n* A Netlify/Vercel account for hosting.\n* An account for where the self-hosted CMS is (I am considering options like Directus or Payload to avoid monthly fees for my clients).\n* An account for the CMS itself to log in and make changes to the website.\n\nThis setup feels complex, particularly for clients who prefer owning their site without ongoing maintenance fees. They may find managing multiple accounts and interfaces daunting.\n\n**My questions to the community are:**\n\n1. Have you encountered similar challenges with modern frameworks like Astro?\n2. How do you simplify the handoff process while maintaining the autonomy and cost-effectiveness that clients desire?\n3. Are there tools or strategies that can integrate these services more seamlessly?\n4. If you've implemented custom solutions or found effective workarounds, could you share your experiences?\n\nAny insights, experiences, or advice on managing client handoffs in this context would be greatly appreciated. I'm particularly interested in solutions that could apply not only to Astro but also to other modern front-end frameworks facing similar issues.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

It eats into the developer budget to make something that the client is able to navigate. And for what? So the client can literally tinker with the site. They don't know what they're doing. We're the website experts that they are relying on for guidance.\n\nIf I make something that is easy and pleasant for me to maintain, then they won't have to pay as much for updates.

Putting an entire CMS and some other back system for a site. A client maybe is going to change one or two times a year. It's just more work than necessary, and it also means security risks as time goes.\n\nLet's face it, somebody could set up a WordPress site for a client and hand it off and be done with it, then. The client is barely touching it, but also not updating the back end when those updates pop up, and then all of a sudden you get a call a year later that their entire site got hacked and the client is angry.\n\nThe only time I ever recommend any CMS is when I know the client needs to change their content regularly. Maybe they are blogging, maybe they are doing e-commerce, or something. On top of that, I try to think about a system that this client can use. I've seen so many people set up these WordPress sites that are so complicated with plugins and other things to make the content happen, and then the client is basically bewildered on what they're supposed to do when they want to make a little change.\n\nIt's great we have all these wonderful systems out there, but I often feel in the end the web designer building something for a small or medium-sized business has to think about the end user and how they are going to be able to maintain this site. If that means you can't do every little thing you would love to do, then that's life. The big robust amazing looking websites usually have dedicated people taking care of them.",

That’s why they, for example, they still have people paying $300 a year for SSL certificates when they’ve been free for the better part of a decade (I saw this with a new client recently).\n\nThere is no shortage of articles, blog posts, social media posts outlining all of the issues with GoDaddy. I’m not the first to point it out, I won’t be the last.\n\nAnd if their business ethics isn’t enough to deter one from using GoDaddy, their founder and CEO (at the time), whose wealth is tied to Godaddy’s success was photographed trophy hunting rare animals in Africa like a psychopath about 10 years ago.

That means you are stuck with whatever design that comes from the author who created the theme. It might also come with bloated free plugins included from  the theme work just to work. \n\nThe second solution is using the modern WordPress native solution which is called full site editing. As the name says. You build your whole website on your edit. \n\nI haven't personally player around so much with it, but based on I have read on the internet, it's a bit Janky and not working as expected. It's kinda early release you could say. \n\nThe third solution is to use native WordPress Gutenberg blocks. The Gutenberg blocks is not intended to look 100% in the back end (where you edit your pages and posts) as in front end (when you publish your posts/pages) pixel perfect, but rather proof of concept which is fine. The Gutenberg Block had been around quite some time and its stable vs the full site editing which is not. You can always try and download different third party Gutenberg blocks to play around and see how it goes. Just be aware those blocks are \"generic\", so you won't get a custom/specialized block based on your needs. That requires you need to develop your own blocks, but you can overwrite the block CSS though. \n\nThe fourth solution is to use page builders such elementor, divi builder, oxygen whatever exist out there. It's not native Gutenberg blocks or full site editing, but rather their own solution that kinda have the same functionality as the Gutenberg blocks and full site Editing you could say. \n\nThe fifth solution is an old school approach where you use something called advanced custom fields where you can create custom fields and custom templates to arrange your website where you can build your own website, but It's not very intuitive to use if you aren't the person who developed the solution. \n\nPlugins or themes is required to install in order to use Elementor for example. For the native WordPress solutions, you don't need to install anything unless you want to use some kind third party Gutenberg blocks.\n\nEdit: this might be overwhelming with lots of options to choose. If you want the easiest solution, then I recommend either use Elementor or Gutenberg Blocks",

Here are the things I need:\n\n***1) User management on backend + frontend login page*** (my small business will require clients to login to a page where they will have customized content tailored to them, e.g. their quarterly invoice, statements, etc).\n\n***2) Simple form to contact me*** (that's ideally hardened somewhat against spammers)\n\n***3) Ability for my assistant who is not technically capable to use a simple web interface to upload documents*** like invoices for each of the clients quarterly for the clients to download. Rest of the website will remain pretty static so no need for a fancy WYSIWIG editor since I'm technically capable and have working knowledge of HTML/CSS (but nice to have nontheless if I need to make quick edits).\n\n***4) The CMS/SSG also generates iOS/Android compatible mobile websites*** so that if someone browses the website on mobile, they can login and see the same theme.\n\n***5) Has a decent collection of off the shelf, ready made company websites*** I can work off of. I don't mind using a blog template or something and customizing it to look more like a company website if that's easy to do.\n\n***6) Free, but willing to pay a little to buy a decent theme if needed or for certain modules on a one-time basis***\n\n\nWhich of the CMS/SSGs I mentioned above best fits these requirements?",

I'm a visual designer of about 10 years, turned UX designer about 4 years ago. One of my referrals sounds pretty easy: making small changes to their website by moving a photo of the new owner to the top of the company's \"about me\" page. I've worked with enough content management systems to figure this out, but she might need more intensive web development next year. My skills definitely lean more towards the design side, but I have done a number of web edits and CMS training over the years at other jobs. Their site looks like it's only 6 pages and I could easily contract out some assistance from other devs if I really need to. I'm hoping to offer web development through Webflow, Wordpress, and Shopify down the road once I get reacquaint myself with those platforms, so this seems like a good opportunity.\n\nI'm thinking to charge $75/hour for basic site changes since that seems to be a pretty common average number. Does that sound reasonable? I'm in the Seattle area.\n\nAnd for pricing larger projects like an entire website, I know the general rule of thumb is to price based on how long you think it would take to complete the work. My secret hourly rate for design/web/UX work is about $160/hour, but I'm a bit unsure how long it would take me to create a 6 page website. My plan so far is to create some other fake projects to get experience.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: thanks for the silver! <3  \nEdit edit: SHE SAID YES TO THE WEB EDITS!!

Stick with hourly until you have a better sense of how long it takes to do the work and what might potentially go wrong along the way.\n\nThe \"secret hourly rate\" happens when you figure out how to charge more for work that takes you less time.

But billing a fixed fee for a fixed amount of work can definitely be more lucrative than billing hourly if you know what you're doing.",

        "author": "TheWingless1",
        "id": "jmo38w",
        "selftext": " \n\n[Early wireframe work on the Inventory Shell Menu for Wasteland 3 \\(PC, Console - inXile, Microsoft\\)](https://preview.redd.it/909ogt194uw51.jpg?width=1958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0618f4832c99122eb459f33bc833c75bfa0bb459)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh hello there, you big beautiful nerd, you! My name is John Burnett, a 20-year UI UX Designer, Art Director and 1-on-1 remote Mentor in the video game industry. **One of the most common questions students ask me is how to start a career in video game UI UX Design**. In this age of wanting to give back generously, I figured I’d take my notes from my bootcamp and compile a quick guide and a few shorthand rules for all of you with Hoop Dreams™. I’ve also taken the liberty of editing those notes into a Q & A format for easy reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Game Portfolio Design, Structure and Standards\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What’s the bare minimum I need to start applying as a game UI UX Designer?\n\n**A:** The 3 keys to the kingdom are: Marketable Projects, A Portfolio to showcase those Projects, and a Resume.\n\nMarketable Projects are the obvious must-haves to start applying, and their quality and relevancy will be *the* overriding factor in folding you in. Notice I said marketable: tonally and artistically relevant to The Company you’re applying to. We’ll talk about that a little later.\n\nYou’ll also need a way to showcase your designs to The Company. A website all your own is an expense, to be sure, but it’s also an incredible platform for any modern Designer to build upon… if your bank account allows.\n\nA Resume is an ancient holdover from the Old World, used to progress through online applications (barely more than a truckstop bathroom key at this point).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** How big should I make my game UI UX Portfolio?\n\n**A:** I always recommend 6-12 pieces with 4-6 media apiece; media meaning a potpourri of final art, icon arrays, sketches, wireframes, video - anything that *enshrines* your designs and provides authentic proof of a process. I also recommend a paragraph or two for project details and a sentence for project duties (conceptualization, wireframing, iconography, art assets, implementation through Unity/Unreal/Scaleform, etc.).\n\nIf this all sounds remarkably lean (but muh War & Peace-long case studies!) it’s supposed to be. Think about it from our perspective: no Art Director is there to hire a writer, and we’ll leapfrog to your images out of necessity or frustration; and you’d better design around the former to stave-off the latter. The dirty truth is most Art Directors have made up their minds about your skills by the time your website loads. No need to belabor the point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q**: Will non-game related Projects hurt my chances at a game Company?\n\n**A**: Just make sure there is enough variety in your portfolio for a team to make a judgement call on your shapeshifting abilities. My portfolio that got me into Midway Games was more about the presentation of my Projects, less the Projects themselves, but it worked. My Portfolio that got me into EA and id Software was much more elaborate and stylized, but still showcased a menagerie of work, not just game art - and that seemed to work too.\n\nIrrelevancy won’t hurt their opinion of you, because the idea of your chances being bent by tangential work don’t really exist. You can make a Lovecraftian portfolio that screams, “I’m unhirable, ahhh!” - absolutely. But you can also do everything right and still not get the call. My little Loves, that’s called *life*.\n\nThe truth is that a game company will hire you for one of two reasons. Either your work is hauntingly similar to the project they’re working on now - or they’re looking for a strong generalist with a kaleidoscopic body of work. That being said, your ability to work print, corporate design and websites is incidental to your ability to create game wireframes, game artwork, and implement in a popular engine. Or simply put, make sure the beer you’re pouring isn’t all foam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Applying and Interviewing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What does the UI UX Design interview process at a Game Company look like?\n\n**A:** Abandon all Hope, ye who enter here. There are 4 Gates before the burning Hells: The Frontliner, The Art Director, The Test and finally The Team.\n\nThe Frontliner can be any number of people: a recruiter, associate producer, outsource manager - their job is to vet if you’re crazy or a liar at a very early stage, as well as field details like salary expectations (you do have an answer for this, right?).\n\nThe Second Harrowing is the Art Director who will ask you far more salient questions - mostly about process and past experiences. These are generally soft-ball questions, as most game Art Directors do not specialize in UI UX Design. Unless your process is ruinously bad, you’re likely off to the next round because it’s the only part that counts in the eyes of The Company: The Test.\n\nThe Third Labor is the bane of all creatives great and small: the Art Test. Art Tests come in a rainbow-variety of forms and intensities. My Art Test for id Software was a week long and I got marauded by the flu by day 2. Got food poisoning during the interview, too - the point is, love it or loathe it, the Art Test is yet another potent way to vet if you’re crazy or a liar... and to see if your portfolio pieces are actually yours.\n\nIf you ice out anywhere, it will be after the Art Test.\n\nThe Fourth and Final Hell is… really perfunctory, to be honest. The last thing you’ll do is talk to the game team (or the small Strike Force you’ll be a part of). This is mostly to see if you and the team can acclimate for 30 minutes without somebody getting… oh, let’s call it *political*.\n\nBarring sudden-onset Tourette's, if you’re meeting with the team, it’s nothing but daylight between you and gainful nerdployment. (Though I do personally have a 1st-hand account of one gentleman who accepted a game job offer, quit our Company, moved out of his apartment and had the new Company immediately dissolve the position while the ink was still fresh and it STILL makes me laugh.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q**: It’s been a few days since I applied. How long should I wait before I move on?\n\n**A:** A week and some change. Game companies are flooded with applications all the time, the majority of which are of a… burgeoning... level of talent. When a Company receives a prospect even remotely qualified, they’ll move on it. Far too much money is at stake to wait for a Super-duper Senior when a whatever-level Designer will do.\n\nOh, and when a Company lists the job as remote-friendly but they want you to move eventually? That means they’re *only* hiring local. It’s a bold-ass, brazen-ass lie.\n\nFor your own sanity, you should gently ping The Company on the status of your application, if only to get a definitive no and move on psychologically. But if they want you, they won’t let a little thing like five workdays stop them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** I’m not even making it into the first round of talks with a Company! What am I doing wrong?\n\n**A:** Not going to lie to you, and I say this with all the gentle R&B-style love in the world: it’s all your ugly-ass projects; **they ugly!** Now, as soul-crushing as that is to hear, there are a few subtle differences between all-ugly and *mostly-ugly.*\n\nFirst, is your work modern? Can I see a blending of trends and modular improvements Industry-wide in your work? Do you know concepts like Masonry Menus, Faux-mouse interactions, and opt-in information design? Are you throwing bizarre web 1.0 photoshop filters over panels and adding glows everywhere? You don’t have to be as breathtakingly polished as the screens you drool over on Pinterest, but you know... act like you belong.\n\nSecondly, are you secretly showcasing that you’re actually a terrible engineer? An Art Director might not have an encyclopedic knowledge of what makes UX work, but they will have a jaw-dropping knowledge of technical game development. If they’re reminded of something functionally wrong, confusing, or in error (no button prompts, no back buttons, no highlight states, etc.) it sends a clear message *you’ve only been making Portfolio pieces and have* no *practical follow-through worth risking a project on*.\n\nLastly, the medium is the message. You are a part of a truly bizarre field where the presentation of information is slightly more important than the data itself. If you were a fashion designer, you better believe you wouldn’t rock acid wash jeans and an Nvidia shirt when applying to Banana Republic (apropos of nothing, my work portfolio shows nothing but blank thumbnails right now).\n\nAs a UI UX Designer in games, how you present yourself is a reflection of how you’ll present “their baby”. In this way, your Portfolio is the hidden, last Project, and, paradoxically, the first impression they will ever glimpse of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Networking, Skills and Growth\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** How should I network as a very Junior UI UX designer for games?\n\n**A:** Slowly. Networking is gardening: exceptionally few initial results with lots of maintenance which eventually blossoms into a plentiful harvest (that makes the initial investment *finally* worth it). The goal isn’t to amass the greatest numbers of followers, likes or resends. The goal is to be in front of a few people who will open doors, build bridges and otherwise sculpt the future with you.\n\nAn easy win for a new Designer is to network with other new Designers at around your skill level. You should also have treehouse-like interactions with other Creatives vying for the game industry but not in your specific field: concept, 3D, props, etc. Working on amateur projects with a real (albeit amateur) team is an amazing way to learn on-the-job skills and to imprint yourself on soon-to-be besties. Eventually your contacts will rise through the ranks, and one of them will take the rest of their friends with them on their meteoric rise. You should be that friend, if you can not flatly be that meteoric riser yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** Should I have a LinkedIn Profile?\n\n**A:** Oh my fu- YES! 3 of the 4 in-house jobs I’ve had (EA, id Software, Glu Mobile) were all the result of some wayfaring Recruiter on LinkedIn. Those were just the job offers that I took, there were dozens more because game UI UX Designers are ludicrously difficult to recruit. If you make it into the Industry, you are staffed like a unicorn; a triple-horned albino unicorn if you can evolve into a Senior. Why make it harder for people to give you a new job title and a 25% raise? In the words of the poet-laureate Tim Heidecker, “Psst… it’s free real estate.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What’s the best way to boost my skills while I wait?\n\n**A:** Make tons of personal projects. This is the method I used to build up my skills and portfolio, back in the 2000’s when we thought you had to save the life of a game designer to become one. Deconstruct okay-ish game screens you know and redesign them slightly better (or at least functionally different). Take an intellectual property that has no game and try to make one, capturing its mood and tone. Grab Unity or Unreal and learn implementation at the same time. Blog about your experiences - see one, do one, teach one. No matter what, just refuse to sit still and your skills will rise ambiently. Having them rise exponentially is… trickier (see: Mentorship below).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What books can I read to improve my UI UX skills specifically for game design?\n\n**A**: Nothing! Not a god-damn thing! There’s virtually nothing out there by way of standards, practices or process for formal video game interface design (aside from the material I’m writing since very few are volunteering). Naturally, there are resources on generic, over-the-counter UI UX Design for apps and websites. But those are blunted, padded affairs compared to the zero-point-of-failure *lethality* of video game development.\n\nIn fact, I would argue vanilla UI UX Design is like flying a cargo plane. Game UI UX is like flying an F-14 Tomcat. Maverick could *definitely* fly a cargo plane and keep it steady for hours. I seriously doubt a cargo plane pilot could hop into an F-14 and somehow just *make it happen.* Some skills translate - but not nearly enough to make you competitive, and definitely not enough to get your ass into Top Gun.\n\nGame UI UX Design is its own intense, unique thing. You absolutely must treat it as such.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What classes can I take to improve my skills?\n\n**A:** I haven’t taken any personally, and as such, I can’t in good conscience vouch for them. All my training is either self-taught or on-the-job… and that totally worked for me.\n\nThat being said, your time would be infinitely better spent with 1-on-1 over-the-shoulder mentorship than with something cold and distant - especially *these* days. Nobody is working under ideal circumstances anymore so, dear God, don’t go out in the middle of the eel-infested waters and try to do this alone. Get a damn swim-partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What kind of 1-on1 Mentorships can I take to improve my UI UX game design skills\n\n**A:** Okay now we’re talking. I broke into the game’s Industry through focus, commitment and sheer (lucking) will. But I would have much rather flourished with a warm and nurturing guide by my side. I would’ve adored some tapestry of, “No, not that red, try the maroon - it doesn’t clash with the navy background. Why not get rid of those three buttons on the side and fit them under one menu button? Your font has these razor thin lines, see? That’s going to disappear on mobile - big mistake.”\n\nFrankly, that would’ve been amazing.\n\nSo I highly recommend, in the absence of any real material on the subject, to learn from the people who are internalizing and redefining those materials every day. Grab a mentor and commit to a few months of lightspeed study. Come with project ideas, Industry questions and what you consider your own weaknesses. Independent mentors (cough cough) tend to be better in quality since they’re working professionals teaching practical skills for the love of the game, but larger mentorship programs (Springboard, IDF, RookieUp, etc.) are also chocked full of warm, generous people, too.\n\nIn the end, your Time is the only resource you will never, *ever* get back. A Mentorship, at its core, is a DeLorean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for making it *this* far in what hopefully hit the balance between a Cracked.com article and a TED talk. Like I said up top, nobody’s been writing about any of these things recently, so I’m doing my best. If you have a subject on the Industry you’d like to know more about, let me know. Love to hear what you all think. Stay safe and stay inspired.\n\n\\-John “[The Wingless](https://www.thewingless.com/)” Burnett",

My system then connects to this account via a GitHub App. From there, the client can modify content through the convenient interface of my system without ever needing to interact directly with GitHub. They can even add their colleagues, who might not have GitHub accounts at all.\n\nWhile the system is highly customizable, all the settings are embedded in the website code (template). Therefore, the client needs to input key values for integration with various other systems. This is why I aim to assist them in this process.",

                "body": "There are a few broad categories and you can pick the right choice for your, based upon expense, flexibility, ease of use, and your comfort with DIY. In broad strokes, you probably want some kind of a Content Management System (or CMS) that lets you focus on writing your content and handles the display of that content for you, based off your settings and choices.\n\nSquarespace is an example of a _hosted service_. They handle all the technical details and let you pick and choose what you want to write and how it's presented. You're limited by what they offer - and have no real ability to change it - but what they offer often happens to be pretty good for a lot of folks. Other examples are wix and wordpress.com (note the \".com\" part). Squarespace tends to be on the expensive end, but folks really seem to like using it.\n\nA little more DIY is _running your own blog_ on a hosting service. This can take a few different forms, but generally involves a very similar authoring experience, but with a corresponding increase in control over the site and responsibility to keep it running. It's often cheaper in terms of dollars, but with a lot more time involved. Also, you get to learn more about how things work. Wordpress is the largest for blogging in particular, but Ghost worth looking at, and you can also look at something like Jekyll, which reduces some of the maintenance but can require a bit of coding.\n\nLastly, you can _just create plain old html_. This is essentially free in terms of cost and infinitely flexible, but takes _a lot_ more time for most people's expectations. It also gives you the most opportunity to learn how things work. That's probably more DIY than you want from your description, but worth mentioning.\n\nIt's worth looking into all three a bit - and there are infinite variations of those three categories, as I'm sure others will point out - and figuring out works for you based upon your desire to write versus your desire to learn to build a website. There's no wrong answer!",

Unfortunately the system doesn't allow for this functionality so I am creating a custom Albums menu item that would exclude those specific albums (something that I am doing through a menu plugin). But I quite like the design feature that when you are in an album's page the album's link becomes bold in the Albums menubar. It just doesn't work with my custom album.

Now, it's been a long time since I've done anything in html and my knowledge of mathematics behind cryptography has rusted from the years since I've taken those courses.\n\nWhat I'd like to do:\n\n1. I'd like to be able to anonymously post content but be able to mathematically prove that I am the author. So I want to attach a public \"key\" while retaining a private key, and it can be easily confirmed by an external public entity that I am the only one capable of generating the public key attached to my content. (I don't think that's usually how public key/private key works so I recognize this is a bit different)\n\n2. I'd like to be able implement an extremely simple password system that controls which content a visitor can view. Simple example, being if I have 10 blog posts, each person I share my website with can only access certain posts depending on the password I give them.\n\n3. I'd like to have a way to timestamp my content. The simplest way I could think of was just to attach the blog post to a twitter account.\n\nNow, for actual questions:\n\n1. Can I realistically do this stuff on something simple like Bluehost with Wordpress?\n\n2. What is the easiest solution for my goals - are there free solutions that are readily available/modular/easily deployed that don't require much html work? I don't mind if my website looks like [https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/) in terms of aesthetics, I value just the content management functionality more than form.\n\n\\-\n\nIn case anyone is curious, my goal with this isn't anything suspicious, I just want to anonymously post predictions on future events without attaching my personal identity but I want to retain an enduring system of record for it so that at any time in the future I could mathematically prove I was the author of the content. (Which wouldn't be possible if someone were to hack the website because while they can change content to prove they have control, they can never \"solve\" the previous keys attached to posted content)\n\nI know this is a LOT of ask, and I am also trying to figure out the simplest possible way to do this.

To generate a signature on some content you need a public/private keypair. Step one is thus to generate such a keypair, you can then publish the public key and use the private key to generate a signature over your blogpost content. Anyone with the content and the signature can verify that the signature was created by the private key corresponding to the published public key.\n2. For this you just need some kind of access control. Basic accounts will do.\n3. What you need is the following: you want to prove that you created some content somewhere in the past without sharing the content itself. You can do this by using, for example, a hash function (a one way function), which will create a short “compressed” version of the blog post content. You can then post this hash on twitter (or even on a blockchain).\n\n1. For (1), this is possible to just post on whatever platform you like, a signature is just a string of characters. For (2) you can use any access control provided by the platform you are using (so for WordPress this is just the normal accounts). For (3) you can also post this on any platform you like.\n2. I think this might be doable for free with some WordPress plugins, you can look into WordProof which is used to post post content on a blockchain.\n\nGood luck!",

You'd have the landing page be a form where users can input the password and submit the form.

        "selftext": "Anyone else ever feel this way?\n\nMy first design job was about 60/40 graphic design/web design. Really small company, very mis-managed, I had to occasionally work as a project manager. I had a fun variety of work but no designer above me, and I was entry level so my non-designer boss would straight up just grab my mouse and change things to actively make my designs worse when he didn't like them. Also was way underpaid. Stayed there about 3 years.\n\nSecond job was predominantly web design, but I had more of a print background than most so I would occasionally help out on that end. Company was run really well, boss was incredibly supportive and most people I worked with were great. Unfortunately the subject matter was excruciatingly boring to the point where it was bad for my mental health - basically created a cycle of me not caring, having to force myself to do work, knowing it wasn't my best work because I didn't care, trying to force myself to do better and then feeling like I couldn't make a difference because our platform didn't allow for a lot of change or testing. Stayed there for 5 years. \n\nNow onto my third and current job... back to super creative work, smaller company but big enough that I can take time off without feeling guilty. Was supposed to have a senior title coming in and a lot more of an overall design focus including both web and print, but their needs changed and now I'm a web designer/dev again. It's a lot more dev focused and a lot less design focused even though I was supposed to be designing a lot more than I am. Have my boss telling me my work is great, but one of the other bosses is seemingly never happy with my design work and seems like I'm never doing enough on the dev front for him even though I'm teaching myself new skills on a practically weekly basis. Came in on false promises that promotion would be possible, now very aware that it probably isn't. Feeling super defeated. Also, we REALLY need a project manager and it's causing so many problems that we don't have one.\n\nI hate always having to feel like a mind reader when doing work, I hate never feeling like I get a solid win in, I hate wanting to be engaged with my work and then being too invested as a result. I hate how I feel like I need to do something creative to not have my soul sucked out of me 40 hours a week, and then feeling so crappy and uncertain of what I'm doing with my life as a result. \n\nDoes anyone have a job where they feel like things are well organized, people are consistently happy with the work they're doing, and they actually feel fulfilled? This industry feels so inconsistent and so unorganized and after about 9 years I'm not sure I'm cut out for it anymore. \n\nThanks for letting me vent and I'd love to hear if anyone can relate or has any advice.",

I have been building websites for about four years, but only recently transitioned away from wysiwyg platforms and am now using design programs like figma. \n\nA little background:\n\nI don’t think I’m bad at what I do, but I’m entirely self taught. My background was in marketing and I worked my way up from marketing assistant to creative manager at my marketing agency. Everything I learned was on my own and I’ve never had anybody above me with a mastery in web design, so I know that there are significant gaps in my knowledge. Especially since I haven’t gone to school for anything remotely like this. I have a basic grasp of illustrator and Indesign and also create all the graphics for our clients as well as well as our agency. So I have a strong understanding of design principles and the basics of UI/UX best practices. To be honest, because I’m the only person in my company who does this, I’m not really sure what level I’m at. This makes me insecure, but I figure the more jobs I take on, the better all get. And I’ve had solid feedback from clients. My agency sells the sites I design for between 10k and 25k (but this includes copywriting, strategy, dev, etc). Hopefully eventually I’ll have a better sense of what I’m worth.\n\nAll this to say, I’m always trying new things by jumping in the deep end. I recently took on a couple of jobs where I’ll be designing a learning platform on WordPress. I realize this isn’t the thread for WordPress, but my question is more about how to design a platform versus a website. I don’t really know where to start and I know that there’s a lot more to think about when it comes to creating a platform where people can interact with each other. \n\nThere’s a great deal of difference between a basic five page website and an online platform where you can sign in, look at your profile, interact with others, take courses, and upload files. Where would you direct me to learn more about designing a platform? Are the design principles I’m used to going to serve me here? Or do I need to learn new basics? I care a lot about meeting expectations, so I’m prepped to learn anything in need to. \n\nAny and all advice would be so appreciated.",

        "author": "Miuchik",
        "id": "nulo9f",
        "selftext": "I'll try to keep my description short, but there is a TL;DR on the bottom of the post in case if I write too much :D I really hope to get some feedback on my issue as I've already spent a lot of time on researching the right CMS and still cannot decide which one suits me best.\n\nSo I'm working on migrating a website from a now-dead and unsupported CMS and cannot choose a new CMS. I am currently looking at Drupal, Joomla, WordPress and Ghost. I am open to other CMS suggestions if there's anything else that fits my use case better, as long as the CMS is well-supported and is not going got die within the next 5-10 years.\n\nThe website is a hobby project, so I do not expect to purchase any plugins, or at least I don't want to purchase any expensive plugins (let's say that anything that costs more than $50 flat fee is expensive). I'm willing to code though, as long as I can find proper documentation and help online. I do data science for a living, hence I have a pretty basic knowledge of web development. Anything related to pure webdev scares me more than migrating a SQL database (at least at the current stage lol).\n\nSo let me describe the website first and then I'll tell what are my current likes and dislikes about each CMS. \n\nThe website is a hobby project. It's a community blogging platform. All users can create accounts and submit their posts (these mainly contain text and images, but also sometimes embedded YouTube videos and Instagram posts). They can also comment the posts, upvote/downvote posts and comments, bookmark posts and comments, and send private messages. Users can also friend/unfriend each other, but this is not too important or used much. \n\nFirst thing that I saw when I started researching is WordPress + Buddypress. I like that the initial installation is easy and fast, but I feel like WordPress was not initially made for multi-year platforms. User access management is weird. The main thing that bugs me is that for every tiny thing I need to search for a plugin. E.g., if I just want to restrict users to seeing only their own media library or disable the ability to edit somebody else's comment under their own posts, I need to either find a working plugin or hook up filters in functions.php. These are very basic permissions, why not supply them right out of the box? I've been also reading that buddypress and any other plugins that I'll put on top of the core to reach my end goal will significantly slow down the website.\n\nThe next thing that I tried was Ghost. I really like how minimalistic it is, but it still doesn't look like a good fit for my needs. In Ghost all authors are trusted users and thus are able to inject custom js. I definitely want to disable that for regular authors. Another issue is that there in no open registration for authors, they can only be invited by email. And no private messages.\n\nThen I watched some tutorials on Drupal. It looks really promising, and I like how customizable it is. The front end is not as sleek as ghost, which I'm willing to forego in exchange for better functionality. However, I cannot find a working module for private messages and reactions to posts, so maybe the only solution is coding. Also, if I start with Drupal 9 then some of the modules that are available for 8 won't be compatible. I've seen that there is OpenSocial for Drupal 8, but it's more like a private Facebook. I only need messages, blogs, likes, comments and favorites. I don't need user activity streams and status updates. I don't know if I can easily turn off all unnecessary functionality. I've read online that D9-compatible version of Open Social will be available in ~6 months or so. If anyone has had experience working with OpenSocial please let me know what you think!\n\nAs a conclusion to my search, I started researching Joomla as well. I can see that there is a free module called Blog Factory that might suit my needs, but I don't know yet how well maintained it is. I see that there is EasySocial, EasyBlog and Jomsocial, but I'm on a tight budget. In addition, I've been seeing complaints about security issues with Joomla, so I don't even know if I need to invest in it at all. \n\nSo, at the moment, I cannot decide between Drupal and Joomla. Which CMS should I choose?\n\n**TL;DR:** I am migrating a hobby project and cannot decide on a new CMS. The site is a blogging platform where users can register, submit blog post, comment, like, and bookmark posts and comments, and send private messages. So far I've test drived/researched WordPress (overwhelmed with plugins, website may be slow with buddypress & Co), Ghost (looks cool, but a lot of features are missing), Drupal (really customizable, but cannot find working modules for some features), and Joomla (not sure how good free modules are, also concerned about security issues). Right now I am deciding b/w Drupal and Joomla. Which one is better for my use case? I'm on a tight budget and would rather code than pay for add-ons. Open to other CMS suggestions! Please help, I feel like I've been stuck with choosing the right CMS for too long.",

I’d look to see if that’s a path that would make sense for you.\n\nOne thing to know is that UI and UX are NOT the same, although they get lumped together offer by hiring managers who know nothing about either. UI is how something looks and functions while UX is how It flows for the users. You can have a beautiful website with shit UX, or a boring one with great UX. My favorite book on the subject is Steve Krug - don’t make me think revisited.\n\nNow back to you: you know how to code already and if you can connect your coding skills to your UX thinking, that’s a solid base. I’d kill to work with engineer you can think about the UX while building out designs, when issues pop up. Try working on some personal side projects, help friends who are trying to build something, go to online conferences and make connections. Those projects will help you expand you portfolio and help make that switch. And finally remember that most listings are describing a dream candidate and are separated from the manager you’d be working for, so take the hard 3yr requirements with a grain of salt. Good luck!",

Most of it is WordPress, not my JAMstack dream job, but I’m the sole dev and can make more interesting things for clients in the future. It started off as a pretty easy-going gig until I had to dive into the previous developer’s websites.\n\nHoly shit. It’s like if you took the concept of spaghetti code and threw it all over the WordPress dashboard. Abstract bolt-on, try anything plugins with no support. 3 different page builders for a 5 page site. Hard-coded edits in the dashboard theme files mixed with shortcodes mixed with normal content. Conflicting CSS in the page builder, customizer, and inlined in content. And that’s if I’m lucky enough to still have valid credentials, because generally Captain Jackass changed the passwords (admin was assigned to his personal email address) and left the project. \n\nToday I’m doing a big redesign and I found that the 44 page website has almost no content in any pages. Nearly everything between the header and the footer is a non-descriptive widget 😦 I lost my mind. \n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the designs 🤦🏾‍♂️\n\nHave any of you had to deal with sloppy previous devs? How did you clean up and get organized? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

We pitched a ground-up rebuild to the client at a competitive rate, and showed him that the total cost of the rebuild would be less than the cost of maintaining the old platform for 11 months.

It's been 2 months since I started learning web development.now i am at intermediate level.. things will go tough when you start working and applying the knowledge you learn. So be perfect kn basics and core concepts of html5 and css. Then start using some css frame works like bootstarp, materialize, material ui which will make your development speed. You just have to understand their classes and syntaxes. Then mimic their components like navabar,carousel,cards,grid-system which will improve your development speed... First you learn html5,css3 with basic understanding of how the things work and then move to css frame works.. i personally use bootstarp as my css framework which has a huge community support... Once you learn html and css you can play with frame works which i am doing. Never hesitate to fix the issue and don't giveup on the making things right.. try to solve issues which will make you feel very confident and keeps alway motivated.. try to search solutions on internet but never giveup... Thats my suggestion buddie. After learning this things you will know what to do next... All the best ☺️",
