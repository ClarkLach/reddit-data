The most common way, which Google provides out of the box, is called Consent Mode, which you can read about here: [https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/concepts/consent-mode#consent-behavior](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/concepts/consent-mode#consent-behavior)\n\n>In general, when users grant consent, tags function normally.\n\n>When users deny consent for ad personalization or ad user data, tags or app SDKs can't use user data for ad targeting purposes.\n\n>When users deny consent \\[or before they consent\\] for storage, consent-aware tags or app SDKs do not store cookies (web) or device identifiers (apps). Instead, tags communicate consent state and user activity by sending cookieless pings (web), or signals (apps), to the Google server.\n\nGoogle Analytics has a feature called Behavioural Modelling that attempts to use that \"ping\" data to estimate or impute the data that wasn't able to be collected: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11161109](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11161109)\n\n>When users don't grant consent, events are not associated with a persistent user identifier. For example, if Analytics collects 10 page view events, it can‚Äôt observe and report whether that‚Äôs 10 users or 1 user. Instead, Analytics applies machine learning to estimate the behavior of those users based on the behavior of similar users who do accept analytics cookies or equivalent app identifiers.\n\nTheir argument from a GDPR perspective would be that because the data does not contain enough information to uniquely identify an individual person, it is not personal data. This argument does perhaps run into some issues, not least of which is that the user's IP address is still exposed to Google in the non-consent case, but some authorities have recommended enabling Consent Mode as a way to achieve compliance so the picture is not clear. Which may well have been Google's intention.\n\nIn your position, I would validate this by checking the cookies that are being left by the Google Analytics script, rather than looking at the `collect` calls.",

        "selftext": "I've received an email from one of our service providers who announced that they delivered a cookie-less tracking solution that eliminates the need to rely on Consent Mode.\n\nI appreciate that cookie consent is more a question of PECR. And if you don't use cookies, PECR is probably not relevant, however: the whole GDPR is about active consent and clarity as to what your PII is being used for and how it's collected. \n\nSo I think that this is an interesting legal question and potentially moral a moral one:\n\nAs far as I see it, \"Consent Mode\" is a reaction to GDPR, enshrined into UK law in the Data Protection Act of 2018, and Cookie laws (PECR). So to say that cookie-less tracking is a solution that circumvents Consent Mode, is a bit disingenious. Tantamount to saying: Google put up restrictions that make it a tad more challenging to ignore the GDPR, so let's use cookie-less tracking to ignrore the law...\n\nDon't get me wrong here, I am not calling the supplier out. I'm primarily interested in where you stand on the issue I describe? And more widely, why do you think this industry is so keen on flaunting the spirit of the law, if not the law itself? - I practically never see a website that has properly addressed GDPR and PECR in the way the regulation was written or what it was intended to do.\n\nThe Rule of Law should be important to all of us. Ignoring the law just furthers lawlessness. And lawlessness makes universal lawlessness a requirement. Businesses that flaunt to the law have an advantage over businesses that adhere to it, obviously. So it's not fair, you aren't competing if you don't break the law.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nAddendum:\nThank you for the replies. I too believe that if the data that's collected is personally identifiable, and since transaction logging is part of this, it almost certainly is PII.\nSo you circumvent cookies and require no consent here, but you still need consent for the tracking.\n\nI would like to know what everyone's opinions are regarding the digital industry's willingness to disregard the (spirit of the) law?",

But that's definitely something good! This is not a shady workaround, this is data minimization in action!\n\nHowever, such cookieless analytics must still address the question of GDPR legal basis. Either the argument is that no personal data is being processed for analytics purposes and thus no legal basis is necessary (usually wrong, even the act of anonymization is itself a data processing activity), or that the analytics processing can be based on a legitimate interest (a much more defensible argument, but not automatically true).\n\nMy personal opinion (mostly inspired by more hardline EU views such as those of the EDPB) is that it is very difficult to create truly cookieless analytics. PECR/ePrivacy is not solely about cookies, but about accessing *any* information stored on the user's device. This may include things as benign as retrieving the visitor's screen size. On the question of legal basis, I feel that if the analytics works on the level of (anonymous) page views, then it will be straightforward to pass a legitimate interest balancing test. But if the analytics solution creates GA-style visitor profiles (e.g. in order to distinguish new vs recurring visitors), or if invasive data is collected (e.g. mouse movements), then this LI balancing test becomes much more difficult.\n\nThe UK ICO, on the other hand, tends to be much more relaxed about such matters. Authorities in the UK and EU tend to be more focused on *advertising* than *analytics*. The line between those two is not always clear though, e.g. Google Analytics can be used with or without integration with the Google ads ecosystem.",

If the answer is a clear \"NO, it is and will be impossible\",  than that's anonymization.

Based on your example will assume here that the umbrella company does not provide any shared services to the sub-brands and that individuals who interact with the sub-brand do not enter into any kind of a relationship with the umbrella company when interacting with the sub-brand.\n\n**Scenario A:**\n\nIf there is no targeted advertising i.e. no personal data of customers or interested parties who have interacted with the sub-brand Halifix goes to Lloyds, then on the surface this is permitted because the advertising is context based. Not based on any personal data collected by Halifax.\n\n**Scenario B:**\n\nThis sitaution sounds like personal data is being shared from Halifax with Lloyds. So you need to know what Halifax data subjects have agreed to (because each sub-brand is an separate data controller); did they agree that their personal and financial data can be shared with Lloyds or not for marketing?  Ideally I would expect several opt-in checkboxes on Halifax webforms or contractual agreements with respect to data sharing for marketing purposes.  (1) to agree to marketing from Halifax; and (2) that personal and financial data can be shared for marketing purposes to the Lloyds for marketing purposes.  If financial data is being shared to the parent organization, I would review the contracts to make sure it's permissible to use the data for marketing - especially because the sub-brands are considered data controllers.",

The data subject must not suffer *detriment* for withrawing (or refusing) consent. But consent can still be incentivized. It is not always clear where the loss of incentive turns into detriment, but I think that the surge of consent-or-pay walls will soon lead to a lot of jurisprudence on the matter.\n\nIn their [2020 guidelines on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en), the EDPB discusses all facets of consent, but of course tries to avoid speculating.

You're paraphrasing Art 13(2) of the ePrivacy Directive, which has been implemented in national law by all EU members (and the UK):\n\n> Notwithstanding paragraph 1, where a natural or legal person obtains from its customers their electronic contact details for electronic mail, in the context of the sale of a product or a service, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, the same natural or legal person may use these electronic contact details for direct marketing of its own similar products or services provided that customers clearly and distinctly are given the opportunity to object, free of charge and in an easy manner, to such use of electronic contact details at the time of their collection and on the occasion of each message in case the customer has not initially refused such use.",

There is no ‚Äúpurity‚Äù requirement where a data subject must give consent solely out of the goodness of their own heart for consent to be valid, as alluded to in your other comment. Consent is inherently transactional by definition.  A data subject is allowing a controller to use data for a specific purpose with their agreement.  Often they will not do that unless they stand to gain some perceived benefit from doing so.  Consent to direct marketing -> receive emails containing info the data subject presumably wants to receive.  Consent to location data processing-> receive information based on specific location rather than more general information that may not be as relevant.  Etc.  The GDPR does not prohibit any of those things - what it prohibits is making giving consent to something that is not necessary a condition of receiving a service.  If your conception of consent as something purely altruistic was true, consent to receive a newsletter itself would not be valid, as the data subject is giving consent specifically so they can receive the newsletter in return",

Until then it's probably violating GDPR.

I don't see how that's enforceable. And I don't see how that's relevant: Most authorities already ruled that on a cookie wall if you have to make more efforts to say \"no\" than you have to say \"yes\" (e.g. because the \"no\" button is hidden in submenus but the \"yes\" button can be accessed on the initial menu and/or is very visible) then the cookie wall is illegal as the consent is not freely given. IMO that's exactly the same with that \"equivalent service/product on another website without pay-or-okay wall\": On the one hand the user can say \"yes\" in one click, but to say \"no\" they have to look for another website to **maybe** find one. And what are they supposed to do if they don't find any? File a complaint to the CNIL? How do we evaluate the ability of a specific internet user to find stuff on the web? For instance is it expected that an old person has the same ability to search the web than a teenager? Loopholes everywhere, which are to the detriment of privacy until an authority maybe does something, which could take years.\n\n>That's not a France thing.

If the **session\\_id** enables the association of the user with specific interactions on the site, it falls within this category and must comply with data protection regulations.\n\nThe key point is that **the GDPR requires prior and explicit consent for any data storage on the user's device that is not strictly necessary for the website's operation**. If your script is used for analytical purposes or any other function that is not essential for the user's experience, consent becomes mandatory. Additionally, the user must have full transparency regarding the collection and storage of this information and must be able to accept or refuse this collection before it occurs.\n\nTo ensure compliance with the GDPR, you would need to implement a mechanism that obtains the user's **free, informed, and unambiguous consent** before storing the **session\\_id** in localStorage. This consent must be recorded, and the user must have the possibility to revoke it at any time, meaning that there must also be a clear way to delete or disable this storage. Ideally, you should use a cookie banner that, in addition to informing the user about data collection, provides an option to accept or reject this practice before any data is stored.\n\nTherefore, contrary to the perception that merely storing information in localStorage does not constitute data processing, the GDPR considers that **the act of collecting and storing data is enough to require compliance with its guidelines**. If there is any possibility of identifying or tracking the user, even indirectly, prior consent must be obtained.",

                "body": "The ePrivacy Directive is commonly known as the \"cookie law\" and specifies when you're allowed to access or store data on the end user's device over a network (whether as cookies, LocalStorage, URL query parameters, or otherwise):\n\n* allowed if the user gave **consent**\n* allowed if the access or storage is **strictly necessary** for a service that they **explicitly requested**\n* **otherwise, forbidden**\n\nDetails and precise wording depend on the concrete EU member state you're in, as EU Directives must first be implemented as national laws.\n\nIf you are of the opinion that consent may not be required for particular client-side storage or data access, it falls upon you to make the argument that storing/accessing this information is indeed strictly necessary.\n\nFor example, storing a session ID is probably strictly necessary for a site that offers log-in functionality and when the user is logged in. CSRF tokens are probably strictly necessary. \"Personalization\" very likely is unecessary ‚Äì there core features of your site that the user explicitly requested will likely work without personalization. What is necessary must always be thought from the user's perspective.\n\nSo on to your concrete questions:\n\n> 1) Do I need to request consent for them through CMP?\n\nDepends on the exact purposes of the data storage/access under these categories. You would have to show that this access/storage is strictly necessary.\n\n> 2) If not through CMP - how do I request consent for those?\n\nStick with your consent management tool.\n\nHowever, in some cases, it can make sense to avoid asking for consent in a banner where users don't have the necessary context. Instead, it can be better to ask for consent \"just in time\" as the consent becomes necessary.\n\n> 3) Are these consents talk about storage in user browser? or anywhere at all?\n> what if I store on my server -> do I still need to request consent via popup question? \n\nThe ePrivcy consent rules are about client-side storage or data access. This is commonly called the \"cookie law\", but applies to any client-side storage. It also applies when the data in question is not personal data.\n\nThese ePrivacy consent rules do not apply to server-side data processing. That doesn't automatically mean all server-side storage is legal. You'd still have to consider GDPR if the data in question is personal data (it usually is). The GDPR expects that you have a \"legal basis\", but here \"consent\" isn't the only alternative.\n\nAlso, this isn't the loophole you might think it is. Server-side storage still typically requires some client-side storage (like a session ID cookie) in order to link the data. Also, accessing data on the user's device in order to send it to the server is also subject to ePrivacy.\n\nOne topic I'm passionate about is consent-free analytics. Analytics *generally* require consent because they involve setting cookies in order to track user sessions and recurring visitors. Some analytics solutions are cookie-free, but still use a bit of JavaScript that extracts data from the browser and sends it to an analytics server ‚Äì that too looks like \"accessing information over a network\" that's subject to the ePrivacy consent rules. Then, the only consent-free analytics approach would be purely server-side, e.g. doing classic 90s-style log file analysis.\n\n> I've read the google docs but they are extremely vague\n\nGoogle cannot give legal advice (and neither can I).\n\nBut you must understand Google's position as an ad network. All this documentation and features like \"consent mode\" primarily serve to insulate Google from liability. I think that the \"consent mode\" also isn't intended to help publishers with GDPR or ePrivacy compliance, but to protect Google when it comes to ad data sharing that is subject to the Digital Markets Act.",

Initially I verbally consented but had no written contracts or anything else signed that said I can't withdraw my consent at any time. Also the videos were posted on Instagram as well when I was only told it would be Youtube.\n\nI asked the creator at a later date to remove my image from the videos on Youtube / IG or take the videos down. He effectively said \"The posted content has too many views and would be too much work to remove\" so he's no help. I have very distinct tattoos and just don't want myself to be out there like that. I'm going to try and claim my tattoos are copyrighted work if the GDPR request fails.\n\nHas someone successfully removed content from IG of themselves in a similar context? I really believe I have a case to file GDPR with IG and Youtube but I'm still waiting to hear back from both of them.\n\n**To be clear, no payment was given to me, no contracts signed, and there were no verbal agreements that stopped me from withdrawing consent at any time.**",

You, a controller, are still sharing personal data (at minimum and unavoidably, that IP) with a 3rd party, Google.  Moving past that objection, and assuming that you haven't configured GA/gtm to set any first (or 3rd, which I don't know if they do by default) party cookies:\n\nYou still have an eprivacy problem.

Congrats!\n\nThe scheme involves a client ID or session ID or whatever, which is stored in the browser and is reused across multiple pages. Thus, this ID allows linking a user's activities over a certain time frame (e.g. a 12 hour window). A scheme that would want to minimize the application of the GDPR might want to eliminate this identifier, e.g. creating a random ID when transmitting each event, preventing any linking. Note that the [GA Consent Mode](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10000067?sjid=5886597897085787556-EU) always creates an ID, but only persists it once consent is given (when configured properly).\n\nRemoving the semi-persistent ID would reduce the remaining ePrivacy concerns, but access to other information on the user's device (e.g. screen and viewport dimensions) might still trigger a consent requirement, unless retrieving that information is strictly necessary for a service requested by the user.\n\nMy tip would be to do as much as you can server-side. You can potentially ingest custom data into GA via the Measurement Protocol. Consider whether you really need visitor-level information, or whether plain views would be good enough.\n\nIn any case, privacy-friendly first-party analytics are usually not an enforcement priority for data protection authorities.",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nThere was recently a public Facebook post about an individual, who was expelled from a boarding school in Norway, due to lying about their whereabouts one weekend, and then being forced to the vice rectors house (which is right next to the school - important to clarify), to write a written apology. They then decided to record this conversation, and the vice rector discovered this, and threatened to expel the student, which she did. I'll quote what happened here, just so we know the full context here: \"After the weekend trip incident, Vice Principal (name removed) ‚Äúinvited‚Äù me to her home. There, I was forced to write an explanation of what had happened. I was told I could not return to campus or my dorm until this was done in her living room. To protect myself, I recorded the conversation. When the vice principal discovered this, she became furious and said she would make sure I was expelled.\"\n\nNow, it came to my attention, that 1. Norway is a one-party consent country, so you can record a conversation that you are a part of, as long as you participate in the conversation. AFAIK, the student never shared this conversation. And 2. Norway is subject to the GDPR, if the data processing goes beyond the scope of \"purely personal or household activity\". Where I get a little confused, is if the GDPR is applicable in this case, and somehow supersedes Norwegian privacy law here, or what? This case is personal, but the boarding school is also an actor here, but this conversation was also recorded in someone's private residency, while the student was \"forced\" to write a written apology, regarding to the school's Code of Conduct, so I am a little confused as to how to interpret this.\n\nIf you could help me understand, then that'd be great. Thanks!\n\nEdit: and the reason the GDPR is being brought up in this case, is because someone said that the student was in the wrong because of recording the conversation without her consent because if the GDPR, and in spite of Norway's one-party consent laws, hence me making this post.",

However, that lawful basis does not have to be consent. This particular situation doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs really a GDPR issue; the student recording the conversation is essentially doing so for personal reasons and is therefore not covered by GDPR. That doesn‚Äôt mean the school can‚Äôt expel them though, it just means they‚Äôre not breaching GDPR. The school, as a controller, would likely need to have a lawful basis to record the conversation, but it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily need to be consent - it could be legitimate interests, for example.

I'm not a lawyer, but I wouldn't assume that a voice is personally identifiable.  \nBut let's assume it is for the sake of the argument, and we instead have two documents : a transcript of the conversation (with personal info removed), and another stating \"this conversation was done by the vice-principal\".  \n\nThe vice-rector identification falls under GDPR scope (which doesn't mean it's *forbidden* automatically. simply it's personally identifiable data), but the anonymous conversation transcript itself isn't.  \nNow, let's change the identification into \"this is a transcript of a conversation made with a member of the rectorate, recorded outside the school grounds\".  \n\nThe vice-rector would still complain. Because it's not about mishanding of his personal data, it's about an (imagined) breach of privacy while they were making a proof of statements they intended to stay off-the-record. (Plus that there is a proof that he forces students to come on his private house outside school hours...)  \n\n>  if the data processing goes beyond the scope of \"purely personal or household activity\"  \n\nYour remark is right : it's a purely personal activity (especially if it was never shared). It would be different depending on use (like, \"I'll use the statements in the recording to signup fake accounts\" or something)  \n\n> but this conversation was also recorded in someone's private residency  \n\nNothing to do with GDPR.

I am finding out that this doesn't work well, because many conversions outside the UK and EU are not being counted in Google Ads.\n\nMy original plan was to only show the consent banner in the UK and EU (and/or other regions where it's mandatory).  But because some conversions outside the UK and EU are not being counted in Google Ads, the only way to address this situation is to show the Cookie Script consent banner to all my customers around the world, and the consent banner also probably needs to cover most of the landing page, to force an \"Accept\" all cookies or \"Reject\" from the customer (hopefully I can get most customers to \"Accept\" the cookies).\n\nNow my questions is, after you put up a consent banner that took up most of the landing page to force an \"Accept\" all cookies or \"Reject\" it from the customers, how was your bounce rate on your landing page? Did the bounce rate on your landing page increase significantly after you put up a consent banner ? Or did the bounce rate only increase slightly and the consent banner didn't stop many customers from browsing your website?",

For example, it might be possible to use some analytics on an opt-out basis under a \"legitimate interest\", especially taking into account the GDPR's flexibility regarding processing personal data for statistical purposes. But I haven't seen this argument being made by any vendors.\n\nWhen reading the marketing of \"GDPR-compliant\" analytics services, it is also important to distinguish two aspects:\n\n* whether the *analytics service* is GDPR-compliant (typically yes, because they'd only act as a data processor)\n* whether *your use* of this analytics service is GDPR-compliant (much more complicated story)\n\nA lot of marketing lacks this important nuance.\n\nBut at the end of the day, if you're deciding between GA versus some other analytics solution that brands itself as \"privacy focused\", it is likely that it will be easier for you to use the non-Google solution in a compliant manner. Not necessarily because it's inherently better, but because you're circumventing the compliance minefield that is the Google Ads ecosystem, and because GA competitors tend to have fewer features that could cause problems.",

                "body": "I find those claims from Plausible to be very misleading. Plausible is a highly privacy-preserving analytics solution, but their misleading claims makes it unnecessarily difficult for Plausible customers to be GDPR compliant.\n\nThe data pipeline looks something like this:\n\nüìú analytics events  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚¨áÔ∏è  \n‚öôÔ∏è anonymization via hashing  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚¨áÔ∏è  \nüìú anonymous data  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚¨áÔ∏è  \n‚öôÔ∏è analytics\n\nSo the argument seems to be that there are no GDPR problems because the analytics processing is only performed on anonymous data.\n\n## Anonymization is processing of personal data\n\nMy first problem with this is that this ignores the anonymization processing. Clearly, this is processing of personal data such as IP addresses. Plausible may not be *storing* personal data, but using the Plausible service definitely involves *collecting* and *processing* it. So these claims in their \"DPA\" are factually wrong:\n\n> Even though the purpose of Plausible Analytics is to track the usage of a website, this can still be done without [‚Ä¶] collecting or storing any personal data [‚Ä¶].\n>\n> By using Plausible Analytics, all the site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously.\n\n## The GDPR concept of personal data\n\nMy second issue is whether that \"anonymized data\" is anonymous within the meaning of the GDPR, particularly Art 4(1) and Recital 26. Personal data is any information that relates to an identifiable person. Data is anonymous if there are no \"means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out\".\n\n1. In Plausible's design, identification remains trivially possible until the \"daily salt\" is discarded. Generating a semi-stable ID so that you can identify whether a visitor is new or recurring is the entire point of this exercise. As long as that salt is available, we can locate the events that relate to a particular IP address / person.\n\n2. Even after that salt is discarded, you can single out a visitor's events within a day. You cannot correlate their records across days though. You don't know the visitor's real-world identity, but this is comparable to cookie based tracking where the visitor is assigned a random ID.\n\n## Pseudonymization as a TOM\n\nSo I think Plausible customers should not consider this data processing \"anonymous\". The more suitable GDPR concepts would be \"pseudonymous data\" (which is still personal data) or data that does not enable identification (which can still be personal data).\n\nThis is great, because pseudonymization is recognized by the GDPR is a recommended Technical and Organizational Measure (TOM) to help with security and compliance, and only keeping non-identifying info relaxes some data subject rights per Art 10.\n\nBut what pseudonymization does not affect is the *lawfulness* of processing per Art 6 GDPR. There will still have to be some legal basis such as consent or legitimate interest.\n\n## The cookie question\n\nMost websites that use analytics will rely on consent, because using cookies (or similar technologies) to access or store information on the user's device requires consent (unless that access/storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user). If no such access/storage is required, then it is likely that a \"legitimate interest\" would be sufficient for analytics.\n\nThe remaining question is whether Plausible actually works without cookie-like technologies. The \"access or storage\" is the important part, *not* the use of a specific mechanism like cookies. Plausible does not do purely server-side analytics. Instead, it expects you to install a JavaScript \"snippet\" on the website, which sends data from the user's device to Plausible servers when certain events happen. [Recent EDPB guidance on the technical scope of the ePrivcy Directive](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-22023-technical-scope-art-53-eprivacy-directive_en) suggests that JavaScript code, tracking pixels, fingerprinting, and query parameters can also be used for access and storage of information, similar to cookies. The ePrivacy conditions apply regardless of whether personal data is involved. Taken together, there is an argument that client-side analytics ‚Äì including Plausible ‚Äì require consent.\n\n## Some EU countries are more flexible\n\nWhat I tend to discuss here is a fairly hardline GDPR interpretation that's also in line with the EDPB.\n\nHowever, various national data protection agencies are much more flexible in practice. E.g. the [French CNIL claims that consent may not always be required](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-et-autres-traceurs/regles/cookies-solutions-pour-les-outils-de-mesure-daudience), and offers a list of analytics solutions they've looked at. Plausible is not on that list, but would likely meet or exceed the CNIL standards.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the CNIL interpretation is not covered by applicable EU law, and directly contradicts some prior guidelines. French data controllers might take the gamble to follow these guides, but it would be rather risky in cases where the CNIL is not the relevant supervisory authority.\n\nSimilarly, the Netherlands have an exception for analytics cookies in their laws, but again I fail to see how this can be compliant with EU law.",

Sending an email asking customers if they want to opt in to receiving marketing is still classed as marketing and cannot be done unless you comply with the appropriate law.

And as you can see, it has been around since 2003, so organisations have only had 21 years to start complying with it. Maybe that‚Äôs too much to ask‚Ä¶\n\nAnyway, to be more helpful, firstly we need to understand what kind of customers you have. Are you B2B or B2C? \n\nPECR generally doesn‚Äôt apply to business contacts, and to over-simplify things a little, you don‚Äôt need consent to send marketing emails to them. So if thats your customer base, crack on as you have been doing.\n\nIf you‚Äôre B2C on the other hand, you cannot send marketing emails to them without consent (or relying on the soft opt in, which I‚Äôm guessing you won‚Äôt be able to do as there are certain things you need to do at the point of data collection that I guess you won‚Äôt have done).\n\nSo for B2C it boils down to two main options:\n\n1) The pure compliance option would suggest that you immediately cease sending email marketing to any consumers where you cannot demonstrate that you have their consent. You have to build your marketing list up again from scratch, this time collecting the proper consents.\n\n2) The pragmatic, risk-based approach would suggest that if you‚Äôve already been sending them emails and haven‚Äôt been getting complaints, they‚Äôre probably not unhappy at receiving them. The risk of enforcement action is potentially low. As long as you allow easy opt outs, don‚Äôt get too spammy and handle any complaints efficiently and effectively, you might well fly under the radar. But that does rely on the business accepting a level of risk.\n\n(This is not formal legal advice and is not a substitute for getting your own professional advice as an organisation.)",

Is this codified in a policy anywhere - ie have they said this was fine formally or is it just an informal arrangement where using the Gdrive for personal stuff is tolerated/not moderated?  \n  \nI think this is worth raising with the company DPO as a first port of call.  Whether you can prove that them transferring access is a breach of your rights would depend on the terms on which they provided you with access in the first place, which is why I ask about any paper trail/policy statement.  Their argument would be that access to the Gdrive is intended for work-related data and anything that you store in there that does not meet that criteria is either \"at your own risk\" or even becomes the property of the company by dint of you choosing to keep it there.  Equally there might be something in another policy (ie a confidentiality policy or data protection policy) which references general terms about use of company equipment/facilities.   \nTheir position is kind of weakened if they have never laid down anywhere these terms explicitly.  \n\nSeems the most likely outcome here is that your complaint will lead to specific documents being returned to you that you feel should not have been taken away and they will (ideally) amend their working processes - but the latter ceases to be your problem when you leave.  \n  \nI think if I chose to keep things on a work drive that was not related to work I would be unsurprised if I lost access to them when my work relationship ended with that company (or even when it was about to end, as in your case).

So there's some motivation to get it right, especially if you don't have legal team behind you.\n\n\nIn my opinion, proving content through solid processes should be good enough. That is, if you can show that you could have only sent a push message if the user consented, that should work.\n\n\nHowever, there are also opinions ‚Äì including by some data protection authorities ‚Äì that this is not enough. In this line of thinking, you shouldn't just be able to show that data subjects in general would have consented, but more precisely when this specific data subject consented to what exactly.\n\n\nSystems implemented along these lines keep an audit log of all consent/withdrawal events. The user-facing part is that the relevant privacy settings wouldn't just show something like \"revoke permission\", but often also show the exact time when that permission was given. I have rarely seen this in apps, but occasionally in cookie consent tools.\n\n\nRelying on operating system permissions can also be problematic because the OS'es settings might not be sufficient to obtain valid consent. For example, consent must be opt-in and specific for a purpose, but permissions might have been enabled by default. Consent also requires transparent information and information on how to withdraw consent, but this may be absent in an OS popup.",

This means that the employer must clearly explain to the employee who is using the vehicle concerned what records are being created, why those records are necessary, what they will be used for, how long they will be kept for, who will have access to them and for what reason.\nIt is critical that employees are made fully aware of the extent of the use of the personal data collected through vehicle tracking. Under no circumstances should an employee be left in a situation in which they are unclear on what information is being collected or the purposes of that tracking. The data collected may not be used for any other purpose, unless that processing is compatible with the original purpose of collection.\nAn employee should receive prior notice and clear and comprehensive information about the type and purpose of the tracking. The Article 29 Working Party (WP29)6 recommended that such information should be displayed prominently in every car, within eyesight of the driver.7 While not compulsory, this may be considered good practice for compliance with transparency requirements.\nEmployers should devise and make available to drivers a policy on the use of vehicle tracking. In the context of the use of vehicle tracking devices, this document should also set out the employer's policy on the use of company vehicles for private use, if private use is permissible.\n\nDefinitely seems like they have breached GDPR here, but what are the potential ramifications or consequences of this?\n\nThey have provided me with this information now, but only after 3 weeks of tracking",

All these identifiers act as a common identifier multiple websites/companies can share and cross reference to know they are all talking about the same person. Then, they can tie to it any other data they have about you and share/sell it however they want. The particularity of a browser fingerprint is that it's way harder to modify/spoof than other types of identifiers:\n- IP: You can use a VPN, reboot your router (some/most routers change your IP if you reboot them).\n- Cookies: You can delete them and most browsers \"sandbox\" them (see third-party cookies).\n- Email address: You can use a throwaway address or just lie if you don't care about receiving emails from that specific website.\n- Browser fingerprint: AFAIK you have to use another browser but there are not a huge amount of them so you will quickly run out of different \"identities\". Some say you even have to use another device, because the fingerprint includes stuff like the resolution of your screen (actually the resolution of the browser window), graphics related stuff tied to your GPU, and so on.",

Now, that said, you can probably slip under the radar and do it anyway.  It's up to you to think through the moral, legal, and compliance aspects of that choice.  My advice is that, if you wish to sell into the EU, you obey their rules.\n\nThere are 3 components to all of this ad stuff:\n\n1 - GDPR is a set of privacy laws that govern sharing info with 3rd parties, such as Google.\n\n2 - ePrivacy is a set of laws controlling the storing of essentially any information on any device of an end user.  That includes cookies, etags, or even info put as params into urls.\n\n3 - country-specific marketing laws.\n\n\nSo, an analysis:\n\neprivacy says you must ask consent for storage of any info not required for basic functionality.  If you use something for 2 purposes, you must ask consent.  So you can use a cookie or other local storage for shopping carts, but you musk ask consent for analytics or ads.  The case law is very clear, and iirc, microsoft got in trouble on this: if you use a eg a functionality cookie, such as a shopping cart cookie, to also do analytics or ads, you then must consent it.\n\ngdpr says you have only a handful of allowed reasons (basis) to process personal data.  The only one that really works for ads is consent.\n\nIn any case: you can take your own decision on doing this legally or not, but the vendors saying you can do these things w/o consent are not being honest with you.",

While nonessential means can also be determined by the processor, essential means are to be determined by the controller. ‚ÄúEssential means‚Äù are means that are closely linked to the purpose and the scope of the processing, such as the type of personal data which are processed (‚Äúwhich data shall be processed?‚Äù), the duration of the processing (‚Äúfor how long shall they be processed?‚Äù), the categories of recipients (‚Äúwho shall have access to them?‚Äù) and the categories of data subjects (‚Äúwhose personal data are being processed?‚Äù).\n\nThe policy holder does not determine what data to provide to the insurance company, he/she does not determine for long the data would be processed, who got accessed to the data or for what specific purposes the data will be processed for. It is entirely determined by the insurance company.\n\nThe Guideline even gave an example of this:\n\n>Example: Bank payments   \n>  \n>As part of the instructions from Employer A, the payroll administration transmits information to Bank B so that they can carry out the actual payment to the employees of Employer A. This activity includes processing of personal data by Bank B which it carries out for the purpose of performing banking activity. Within this activity, the bank decides independently from Employer A on which data that have to be processed to provide the service, for how long the data must be stored etc. Employer A cannot have any influence on the purpose and means of Bank B‚Äôs processing of data. Bank B is therefore to be seen as a controller for this processing and the transmission of personal data from the payroll administration is to be regarded as a disclosure of information between two controllers, from Employer A to Bank B.\n\nRegarding your example of an online store, the online store would be considered a data controller, i dont know where you get the idea that it was a data processor.\n\nThink about the issue from a logical standpoint, if your reasoning is correct, all service providers would be data processor and the majority of the data controller would be customers. In which case, the GDPR would become essentially useless because all of the processing obligations would be on the customers since controllers are responsible for the processing of the processors. The service providers would essentially have no responsibilities while the customers would have to carry the burden of compliance. No one in their right mind would design such a flawed system.\n\nOn a more practical note, you can go and read the privacy notice of any insurance, social media, e-commerce, delivery company, they would all identify themselves as data controllers. If they were processors, they would not need the privacy notice at all since they are processing on behalf of others.\n\nOn your point regarding fulfilling legal obligations, the insurance company has no obligation to sign the insurance policy with the policy holder. Them not engaging in the contract is not illegal. Fulfilling legal obligations only applies if they are legally required to process such information. In this case, the processing of the data is necessary because they engaged in a contract which they were not obligated to.",

Doing some more digging, I stand corrected; the insurance company in this situation is a data controller and cannot use the household exemption (My background is more in the B2B context where companies are providing each another personal data for processing, vs. a B2C situation where a consumer is providing a business personal information directly).\n\n[Practical Law has guidance surrounding beneficiaries](https://www.serlecourt.co.uk/images/uploads/documents/Suzanne_Rab_-_Practical_Law_-_GDPR_implications.pdf) for trustees and personal representatives that may be applicable (although not directly related to insurance, there are some similarities).  They indicate that the most relevant grounds for processing their personal data is a legal one (I've omitted the legitimate interest consideration as you stated that it does not apply in your country).  So I would check your country's estate and insurance/financial laws surrounding identifying a beneficiary (no one is forcing the parties to enter a contract, but it looks like if they wish to enter into one the legally need to identify a beneficiary)\n\n>In most cases, personal data about beneficiaries will be supplied by the settlor or testator or gathered without\r beneficiary consent. Consent is therefore unlikely to be a ground that could be used by trustees and PRs. Also, if\r consent to processing is relied on, additional obligations will apply to the data controller and beneficiaries will\r have additional rights including a right to withdraw the consent so that data can no longer be processed, data\r portability rights and the right to have the personal data erased.  \n>  \n>\rThe most relevant legal ground for processing personal data is likely to be that trustees and PRs are legally obliged\r to hold information about the beneficiaries (and, conceivably, other family members or individuals who had a\r relationship with the settlor or testator) as part of their duties in running the trust or administering the estate.\r \n\nAs for having secret beneficiaries there appears to be some case law that supports limited disclosure\n\n>The GDPR makes a distinction between data provided by the data subject and data provided by someone else\r (such as a settlor or testator). Where data has been provided by someone other than the beneficiary, trustees and\r PRs may be able to rely on confidentiality obligations owed to the settlor, testator or other beneficiaries to limit\r what they disclose (Article 14(5)(b) and (d), GDPR). However, the court‚Äôs approach to this limitation under the GDPR\r is uncertain (Dawson-Darmer v Taylor Wessing LLP).   \n>  \n>Notably, the Data Protection Bill 2017-2019 includes an exemption from the GDPR obligation to provide data subjects with information about personal data that is processed (see Privacy notices) where a claim for legal professional privilege could be maintained in legal proceedings (paragraph 17, Schedule 2, Data Protection Bill 2017- 2019).",

They are asking for the information to complete/fulfill the policy that is being purchased (the contract).  The policy holder is determining/specifying how the insurance company is to use the personal information (for the purpose of providing an insurance policy).   Guideline 07/2020 says that the controller defines \"key elements\" but that does not necessarily mean that the controller determines specifically what personal data needs to be provided to the processor.  The processors often ask for the personal data that is necessary to fulfill the policy/contract being purchased (because the controller often does not know in advance).  Consider an an online store - the purchaser does not get to define what data is required to provide to the store to fulfill the purchase - the online store determines this and they would still be considered a processor with the information they are collecting from the purchaser.  If the online store was going to use the information outside of fulfilling a purchase, then they would be considered a controller.\n\nA processor is defined in the guideline as \"a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.  In the insurance scenario, that information is coming from the controller (the policy holder), and being provided to the insurance company for processing.\n\nAn insurance company asking for beneficiary information from the policy holder (the controller), is likely doing so to fulfil a legal obligation (there is probably a regulation that stipulates that a beneficiary needs to be identified for an insurance policy to be valid).",

It's hard for the online shop owner (client in this diagram) to state that this cookie is required for the website to operate. However by classifying that way it's depriving the marketer (me in the diagram) of the information they need to provide their services.

If yes, then there's no need to store your data in the EU: it is not considered personal data. If no, well, the other dispositions you provide are indeed needed.\n\n\nThe legitimate purposes for personal data processing are as follow:\n\n* Public Task/Service (for society): for instance, governments may maintain secret files of would-be terrorists; health agencies may request mobile phone data to study mobility patterns and contain an ongoing epidemic. In these cases, few personal data rights, if any, are to be granted.\n* Vital Interest (of the data subject): medical records may be transferred in urgency from a hospital to an emergency care unit without waiting for the consent of the involved person.\n* Legal Compliance (of the controller): to keep accurate accounting records a company needs to keep on file who it has done business with, and the data subject may not object to this usage, nor to the needed information being forwarded to public administrations.\n* Contractual requirement (between subject and controller): an online service provider hosts some of your personal data. You can‚Äôt ask for erasure of all this data while the contract holds. Termination of the contract has to come first.\n* Legitimate Interest: when there is a minimal impact on the individual‚Äôs rights and the individual should reasonably expect that their data is being stored, there can be an exemption from obtaining explicit consent. Website cookies that are used to maintain navigation history visible on the page during a session, for convenience and not to track the user for other purposes, may fit this category, for instance. Scientific research may also be considered a legitimate interest, in particular when the intent is purely epistemic and/or line of responsibilities are clearly stated (independence). Finally, an entity may maintain a database of individuals having committed unethical, non-deontological conduct under this reason for processing, as the ACM proposes to do with its ethics violations database.\n* Consent: all personal data storage and processing that does not fit in the above categories must require the explicit and informed consent of the individual, and this consent must be recorded. The full rights of individuals over their personal data, as described above, are applicable. Of note, this is the default category all processing fit in: unless you have a good motivation your processing belongs to one of the above category, you will be required to request consent from your user. \n\n\nThere seems to be 2 categories that could fit your requirement of not seeking for consent: contractual requirement (if you have a contract with your users to provide a specific service) and legitimate interest, which is a \"catchall\" category. To use the legitimate interest argument, you have to balance the risks of privacy violation of your users with the service provided. Also consider: are your users/clients natural persons or enterprises? The GDPR only applies to natural persons. With enterprises, you enter the terms of contract law.",

The GDPR explains its concept of anonymization vs identification in Recital 26. Anonymization is achieved when you no longer have reasonable means to identify data subjects, not even when using additional data or with help from third parties. A typical example of identication would be that you could find those crash reports that relate to a particular user, or if you can figure out whether two crash reports relate to the same or different users (\"singling out\"). You probably have identifiers such as session IDs that allow you to single out a data subject, or allow correlation with other identifying data that you have.\n\nIn practice, it is much more straightforward to treat crash reports as personal data, and to select an appropriate legal basis.\n\n> If not, then every single HTTP request that doesn't go immediately to a Controller-owned server would require a legal basis.\n\nWell yes, kinda. You need a legal basis for all data processing activities that you control. Taking into account the *Fashion ID* case, that would include causing the user's browser to send requests to some server.\n\nTypically this is quite unproblematic because those servers will be run by your data processors. The GDPR allows you to outsource everything about your processing activities, except your responsibility. You do not need a legal basis for engaging a processor. There is no legal distinction between a physical server that you manage yourself in your basement versus a server that a data processor manages on your behalf.\n\nWhere things get tricky is if you use services that are not your data processor, but independent controllers. That can be legal, but you better have a good legal basis that authorizes this data sharing. An infamous example was the \"Google Fonts\" case. Google Fonts does not offer a DPA, so has to be treated as another controller. In that case, a court found that it was not *necessary* for a legitimate interest to use Google Fonts, at least for the website in question. Necessity is a key component of all Art 6(1) GDPR legal basis other than consent.",

They basically provide that either the ‚Äôuser‚Äô (the person using the ISS) or the subscriber (the person who has a contract with the internet service provider) must consent to the setting of cookies and similar technologies on the equipment (desktop computer, laptop, mobile device etc) being used. This is not quite the same as consenting to the processing of personal data in UK GDPR terms. **However, it remains the case that for consent to be valid the person providing it must understand what they are consenting to.** This means that you need to take proportionate measures, taking into account the risks inherent in technology being used, **to ensure that a child providing their own consent is competent to do so.** Further information on what this means in practice will be provided when our guidance on cookies is updated.\n\nIt has been argued that certain age verification schemes (like a check-box that says you're over a certain age) is not adequate for determining if someone is of the proper age.  So if you are confident with your age verification scheme then theoretically you can put the two together so long as its clear.  If the consent is for marketing, that option needs to turned off and based on what is happening with Meta, you are unlikely able to force targeted advertising (especially if it's children).",

Because Wordpress has Guestmode enabled, it sets the cookie _lscache_vary, which records whether a visitor is logged in, and if not, it serves them a cached page.\n\nIs this a \"strictly necessary cookie\"? Probably not, as I can disable Guestmode, with the only difference being that the site gets slower because I can't use cached pages. As far as I can see, that means that **I am not allowed to cache pages until I've asked for consent**, which means that I'll have to use slow, non-cached pages for every new visitor. Have I understood that correctly?\n\nThen Vimeo sets the Cloudflare Bot Management cookie __cf_bm, which records whether the user is a human or a bot. This one... **might** be strictly necessary? I don't think there's anything I can do to stop the cookie from being written if I want Vimeo to work, in any case.\n\nSome other Vimeo and Wordpress cookies are set if the visitor logs in (a test cookie, and one that stores account details) or plays a video (preferences and Vimeo usage history cookies). I'm guessing these might all count as \"strictly necessary\" for their respective uses?\n\nSo what if the user clicks \"reject all\" on the cookie banner? What do I do then? Nothing at all, because all the remaning cookies are strictly necessary? Or does that mean that I can skip the banner entirely?\n\nAlternatively, if the Vimeo usage history cookie doesn't count as \"strictly necessary\", do I have to record their answer and block them from watching videos? Or try to figure out some way to stop Vimeo from storing usage history?\n\nI'm confused.",

In particular, necessity must be viewed from the user's perspective. For example, advertising-related cookies might be necessary for a website's business model, but they are not necessary to show that page right now.\n\nOn the other hand, this provision is commonly interpreted a bit more widely. In particular, security measures cannot be optional, they are strictly necessary for the service as a whole to work. Similarly, some degree of caching is probably necessary, and sometimes cookies are needed for that.\n\nInstead of thinking about this as a choice between \"allow all\" and \"reject all\", a more compliant viewpoint would be the three choices \"allow all\", \"customize\", and \"necessary only\".\n\nWhen embedding third party content on your pages, cookies are only part of the issue. The mere act of causing the browser to load that third-party content discloses personal data to that third party, and thus requires a legal basis. Common solutions are:\n\n* The third party is contractually bound to perform some service on your behalf, and will not use your user's data for other purposes.\n* Embedding the content is necessary, e.g. to fulfil your contract with the user or to meet a legitimate interest (this is similar to but weaker than the \"strictly necessary\" standard for cookies).\n* The user gave their consent.\n\nIn many cases, consent is the appropriate choice. This doesn't have to be part of your consent banners that primarily discuss cookies, though it can be. In case no consent has been given (yet), the embedded content might be replaced by a placeholder that asks for consent. Once consent is given, the placeholder is replaced by the actual content. I commonly see this for embedded Youtube videos, social media posts, or maps. This is a great way to ask for consent because the benefit is obvious to the user, and you can use the consent request to explain potential problems (e.g. cookies that the embed provider will set).\n\nVimeo is interesting because it might act either as a video content delivery network that is your data processor, or like a video sharing platform where embedding would likely require consent.\n\nLoading Stripe is probably necessary for the purpose of entering into a contract, but only on your checkout pages ‚Äì not on other pages.",

In that case you need to write a balancing test. Something like why this stuff is good for your company and why is it bad for the customer, why are your companies rights better and how you minimize the damage the data processing causes. It is not that hard, but you need to find a few examples first to know how it should look like. Another ground that you have a contract with the customer and that fraud prevention cookie is required to fulfill the contract. In the case of webshops I think this latter is a lot more common because you have a contract before payment.",

In other words, is it still compliant even if you do not allow people to receive the lead magnet/download if they don‚Äôt click the button/checkbox for consent?\n\nTo clarify, the checkbox would not be pre checked, but checking the box would be a condition of receiving the lead magnet.",

It says that consent is required when:\n\n* accessing or storing information on the end user's device, unless that access/storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user, or when\n\n* using non-anonymized traffic data for purposes other than performing the transmission.\n\nNote that the purpose is decisive, not the data itself. For the access/storage case, it doesn't even matter if the information is personal data.\n\nThere is an old WP29 document from 2014 that argues that basically any use of JavaScript APIs in the browser can require consent, because use of such APIs implies access to information on the end user's device.\n\nSo if you need to access the user agent string or JavaScript APIs in order to display the site properly, that is going to be perfectly fine without consent. For example, if you want to serve a fallback site for Internet Explorer users, or to change the page layout when the window is less than 600px wide.\n\nBut if you access the same information for a different purpose that is not strictly necessary, then you're going to need consent. Analytics are not strictly necessary.\n\nSo under a strict reading of the ePD, the only way to run analytics without consent is to use anonymized traffic data, without client-side data collection. That traffic data may or may not involve using the user-agent HTTP header, though by itself the user agent string might not be quite anonymous.\n\nThe ePD is of course insane because it leaves no middle ground between ‚Äústrictly necessary‚Äù and ‚Äúconsent‚Äù. Notably, it lacks a concept of ‚Äúlegitimate interest‚Äù. This has been lamented since about a decade, but the proposed ePrivacy Regulation still hasn't been passed (any year now‚Ä¶).",

Equivalent legislation has obviously been implemented in EU countries.\n\nThe reason it is a separate consideration is because it goes further than the GDPR. Rather than needing to gain consent to process personal data, what you are asking consent for is to store or access information (i.e. cookies) on a person‚Äôs device. The information might be anonymous. This makes no difference. \n\nIf the type of cookie is exempt from the regulations, you would THEN consider whether the GDPR applies. It only would if the cookies store or access personal data. Note that a person‚Äôs IP address is often deemed to be personal data.

                "body": "Indeed, the state of GDPR and ePrivacy compliance in apps tends to be sub-par.\n\nPart of this is a social/awareness problem by developers.\n\nFor example, many people know about the ‚Äúcookie law‚Äù. Fewer people know that it's actually the ePrivacy directive, that it is entirely technology-neutral, and that its rules on accessing and storing information on the end users device are much more relevant for mobile or desktop apps.\n\nWhen a mobile app developer thinks about consent, it's likely related to app permission system from the operating system, e.g. access to location/microphone/camera/contacts.\n\nPart of it is technical also. The web is an extraordinarily transparent platform. It is easy for users and regulators to see what a website is doing, and much more difficult to inspect an app.\n\nTo inspect an app, I need to sign up for some app store, and then decompile the app, or run it on a jailbroken device. Due to certificate pinning it might be impossible to inspect traffic flows ‚Äì TLS only leaves the destination IP/domain visible. All of this is difficult.\n\nTo inspect a website, I just open the website and can use the browser's built-in features to see what it is doing (e.g. F12/devtools). I can easily log the exact requests and inspect the payloads, without having to circumvent certificate pinning. I can easily see what data has been stored by the website. There are tracking blockers that automate this traffic analysis and can alert the user.\n\nBtw the relative lack of mobile tracking blockers means that apps are much more valuable to ad-driven companies than their websites. For example, Reddit's mobile website is pretty awful, and clearly designed to push users to their app where they can show ads without interference. Were it not for this tracking (and for Apple's/Safari's opposition to support Progressive Web Apps), there would be little reason for most native apps to exist.",

In short, data that has been properly anonymized is not subject to the GDPR - but you have to be careful that it has been properly anonymized, and not just pseudonymised (there's a section on this too). \n\n[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/#pd5](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/#pd5)\n\nBTW - just want to clarify something with the whole consent thing. When you say \"obviously asking for consent to process that data would be appropriate\" - this is the case if you're asking for special category data (ethnicity would count as this), as there's no other lawful basis or Article 9 exemption that you could rely on, but if you're only asking for normal personal data (name, email, address etc, and no special category data) then you could most probably rely on Article 6(1)(f) - legitimate interests. It's usually the case that market research/customer satisfaction surveys etc. with the purpose of helping to improve a business's services can fall under this legitimate interests basis. You therefore wouldn't need to ask for consent at all, but would obviously still need to provide a privacy policy setting out to the data subject exactly what you'll be doing with their personal data. It might be an easier way to do it (if you don't need special category data) - as the issue with asking for consent is that there is way more to GDPR consent than the normal notion of consent in every day life. It has to be specific, informed, unambiguous, opt-in, clear language, evidenced, freely given (the data subject can't suffer any detriment if they don't give it) and has to be able to be withdrawn as easily as it was given.

The ePD is implemented in each countries national laws, so there can be small differences. However, the ePD doesn't care about whether the cookies contain personal data. It's not even specific to cookies: any access to or storage of information on the end user's device requires consent, unless that access or storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user.\n\nAnalytics were not explicitly requested by the user. They are not strictly necessary for the website to work. Thus, even allegedly-anonymous first-party analytics cookies require consent.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the cookie consent issue was never the problem with Google Analytics. It is a data quality problem because you can't see users that didn't give consent, but it's not necessarily a compliance issue. GA cookies are also set as first-party cookies. That GA fails to be GDPR-compliant has much more to do with data transfers into the United States.\n\nBecause some users might not give consent to analytics, there is an interest in cookie-less analytics. Or more precisely, analytics that don't require consent under European rules. The most straightforward way to achieve this is to do server-side analytics that do not collect additional data beyond what is technically necessary. However, this strongly limits what you can see. Counting pageviews is easy, but estimating unique users is challenging without doing invasive fingerprinting that would raise GDPR concerns again.",

While I am aware of the existence of some implementations of the proxy idea, the approach really hasn't taken off, and websites tend to migrate to other analytics services (which may or may not be better than GA).\n\nBut yes, I believe that if cookie consent is sorted out and if a pseudonymization proxy strips out identifying info (such as user IDs, IP addresses, ‚Ä¶), then the use of GA could still be compliant. Pseudonymization is recognized by the EDPB as a potential supplemental measure to make data transfers into the US legal, see [Use Case 2 / paragraph 85 in their Recommendations (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en).

For example, the GA4 \"consent mode\" may or may not be helpful here.

All the laws implementing a Directive are supposed to be equivalent in the essential parts. GDPR itself is the same everywhere, and the GDPR makes it very clear where and how your national laws could deviate.\n\nThe entire point of EU law such as Directives and Regulations is to create a Single Market where you only have to deal with a single set of rules (the ones in your home country), not 27+3 different rules depending on where customers/users are from.\n\nThe Dutch exemption on analytics cookies is potentially invalid, because the ePrivacy Directive does not afford member states any leeway to add further exceptions to the consent requirement. The ePrivacy cookie consent requirement is independent from the concept of GDPR legal basis, so the Dutch DPA's suggestion of a \"legitimate interest\" for analytical cookies looks objectively wrong to me. In any case, read the Dutch guidelines here: https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/onderwerpen/internet-telefoon-tv-en-post/cookies\n\nSimilarly, the German law providing a similar exemption was rather dubious since the relevant rules appeared in the ePrivacy directive, especially since GDPR clarified the definition of consent. In any case, the paragraph ¬ß15(3) TMG that could be understood as an exception was abolished in 2021, when Germany finally implemented ePD properly.",

I've recently discovered that the Dutch DPA published a manual on how to configure Google Analytics in order to use it without the need for user consent. OK, there's a disclaimer that the recent case by the Austrian PA might change all of this, but even without that I'm confused about the following:\n\n1. No matter how you configure GA, it still sets cookies. I would think this is in violation of the ePrivacy directive.\n2. GA always generates a unique user ID, stored in a cookie. I'm under the impression that user-ID's, used to connect all data collected on your website over multiple visits to a unique user, are considered personal data under GDPR, and therefore need explicit consent.\n\nIs there anyone who knows why my above assumptions are not correct for the Netherlands? That would help me understand the complete absence of analytics consent requests by Dutch websites.\n\nPS: You can find the manual in Dutch [here](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/sites/default/files/atoms/files/handleiding_privacyvriendelijk_instellen_google_analytics_april_22.pdf).",

This is part of the EU ePrivacy directive. In this context, it does not matter whether the cookies (or similar technologies) contain personal data, as confirmed by the CJEU in the *Planet 49* case.\n* If Dutch data protection law has an analytics cookie exemption, then this potentially violates the EU directive.\n* In any case, the exception in Art 11.7a(3)(b) of the Dutch *Telecommunicatiewet* can only apply if the service in question is based in the Netherlands. It does not provide permissions for services from other EU member states.\n* The Dutch guidelines for Google Analytics pretty much suggest a reasonable baseline configuration for Google's Universal Analytics product. GA4 offers additional options for configuring GA in a more privacy-respecting manner.\n* In particular, GA4 makes it easier to collect analytics without storing anything on the user's device. This was also possible with UA, using an undocumented option `'client_storage': 'none'`.\n* We are in total agreement that GA's Client ID is personal data, so that it falls under the GDPR. This doesn't mean that processing it is forbidden. You do not ‚Äúneed explicit consent‚Äù ‚Äì GDPR merely requires that you have a legal basis. That might be consent, and it's traditionally consent for analytics since you need consent anyway for the cookies. In a footnote, the Dutch guidance suggests a legitimate interest instead.\n* The disclaimer at the top of the Dutch guidance correctly points out concerns by the Austrian DPA and others about the lawfulness of using GA. This is unrelated to cookie consent issues, and is entirely about Schrems-II / data transfer issues.\n* If you're setting up a new analytics solution, it might be sensible to use an approach that won't be ruled invalid in a few months anyway. Consider using an analytics product that *guarantees* where your data will be processed, or host your own. For example, Matomo is Open Source software that you can host on your own servers, and it offers cookie-based analytics that are roughly comparable to GA/UA. I don't want to recommend paid/SaaS solutions, but there are a couple of providers with no ties to the US or other inadequate countries. The primary reason why GA is so popular is that it's decently good and free (since it acts as a loss leader to pull you into the Google Ads ecosystem).",

The ePrivacy directive was last updated in 2009, when there was a much more relaxed definition of consent with significant overlap with legitimate interests. GDPR defined consent much more precisely, requiring other DPAs to update their cookie consent guidelines.\n\nAn EU-wide ePrivacy update has long been planned, and the draft ePrivacy Regulation does allow for cookies being set on a legitimate interest. However, the regulation has been stalled and I won't believe any further news about alleged progress until it's actually voted on.",

Can I use cookie-based analytics under a LI?\n2. Can I use cookie-less but client-side analytics under a LI?\n3. Can I use server-side analytics under a LI?\n\nThe **first question** is simple: No. EPrivacy requires consent, unless you can rely on the special Dutch law. There is no room for a LI argument here.\n\nIt is likely that your legal counsel gave their advice in the context of this first scenario, and it seems absolutely correct.\n\nThe **second question** is more tricky. With cookie-less analytics, you're no longer *storing* information on the user's device. But the analytics JavaScript running in the browser might still be *accessing* information on the user's device for analytics purposes.\n\nMy personal opinion based on a strict reading of ePrivacy is that cookie-less analytics typically still require consent: they collect data on the user's device, this access is not strictly necessary, and thus ePrivacy requires consent ‚Äì regardless of whether any personal data is involved. I think that this position is supported by the [WP29 opinion on fingerprinting from 2014 (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp224_en.pdf), especially section 7.1 (page 9):\n\n> A number of online services have proposed device fingerprinting as an alternative to HTTP cookies for the purpose of providing analytics without the need for consent under [ePrivacy] Article 5(3). [‚Ä¶] However, [previous opinions] also stated that currently there is no exemption to consent for cookies that are strictly limited to first party anonymised and aggregated statistical purposes. Therefore, first-party website analytics through device fingerprinting do not fall under the exemption [‚Ä¶] and consent of the user is required.\n\nIn practice, no one cares and such information is routinely collected without consent.\n\nFinally, the **third scenario** is interesting. With server-side analytics, no extra data is collected on the user's device. The only data used is that to which the server has access anyway. This server-side information could be a HTTP log file, but also much more interesting information such as business-level events (e.g. user 123 purchased article XYZ, user Alice visited user Bob's profile, ‚Ä¶).\n\nBecause no client-side information access occurs, we can ignore the ePrivacy consent requirement.\n\nInstead, we only have to think about a suitable GDPR legal basis for processing this personal data. The proper legal basis will depend a lot on the purpose for which we are using this info, and with ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù I mean something more specific than ‚Äúimproving our services‚Äù.\n\nI think there would be a fairly strong LI argument if the purpose is to collect aggregated measurements of system usage. I would be more sceptical if the purpose is profiling users, e.g. creating personalized interest profiles for marketing purposes.",

An example of storage would be placing a cookie on the user's device. An example of access would be reading a cookie on the user's device, or using JavaScript APIs to read out the browser window size for analytics purposes (accessing the window size purely for layout purposes would be strictly necessary though). My opinion here is based on the guidance on fingerprinting published around 2014 by the WP29, the EDPB's predecessor.\n\nSince analytics are not strictly necessary and were not explicitly requested by the user, **that means you need consent**.\n\nThe ePrivacy requirements are extremely strict and pretty problematic, but that's the law we have to deal with now.

My understanding is that under the ePrivacy Directive, this still requires cookie consent, as it is data stored on the user's terminal device.\n\nSecond, the hashing inputs do not include hostname. This allows tracking users across different websites without a direct hand-off, something which is not possible with the first-party cookies used by Google Analytics. This is, in one particular respect, more invasive than regular tracking that relies on first-party cookies. I believe it may also put you at greater risk for CCPA. \n\nI also don't think there's a strong value proposition in preventing third-party providers from linking an identifier to a data subject. They're Processors/Service Providers. They are contractually and legally obligated not to attempt to identify data subjects except under the Controller's direction. What threat model is this protecting against? And, more to the point, why does that threat model *not include you*, another third-party service provider processing the same data?\n\nI have some concerns that this doesn't actually count as anonymization under GDPR and/or CCPA. You're over-focusing on the ability to tie the identifier back to the identity. But you're still building a profile on a user and tying those data points together, which can still be personal data if the profile is rich enough. The boundaries of that are still untested. \n\nFrom a pragmatic view, destroying the data every 24 hours means no data on repeat visitors or long-term engagement. That's going to kill a lot of use cases for Google Analytics. I'll be the first to tell you that 90% of the features don't get used by most people, but that's a big one that's widely considered one of the basic fundamentals.",

It also comforts us that being open and transparent can benefit both the community and us.\n\nVerifying claims and, more generally, trusting third-party services, if not dogmatic, is certainly a matter of communication, certification, transparency, and time. I can't argue this point.\n\nWe consider that the entropy provided by the /dev/urandom of AWS Lambda is not sufficient as far as the security of our customers is concerned and thus do prefer to rely on industrial-strength sources. \n\nWe claim publicly on our website that we forward to Google Analytics a \"cryptographically secure pseudorandom identifier (**generated from** a minimum of 384-bits of entropy)\". In other words, we are talking about the randomness of generated IDs (guaranteed by at least 384 bits of entropy) and not about their lengths. Also, we don't see any argument in favor of generating random IDs larger than 128bit.\n\nConcerning Kinesis, the MD5 hash used for the partition key is not about security but about partitioning and distributing data in the Kinesis shards for load balancing purposes. Furthermore, this hash's security is out of scope as **we store the actual data in Kinesis**.\n\nWe claim publicly on our website that \"anything at **rest** uses AES-256 GCM **encryption**\". It concerns data stored in Kinesis. In other words, the security of data in Kinesis is guaranteed by symmetric encryption and not by hash algorithms. Please be aware that we provide a multi-part data processing pipeline, and the security of the approach relies on multiple complementary aspects. It should not be reduced to simple hashing algorithms. \n\nConcerning Dynamodb, we use a keyed hashing algorithm with a 32 bytes key generated randomly from at least 384 bits of entropy. There is nothing even vaguely foreseeable with the current state of arts, including quantum computers, able to brute force this hash. Note however that the IDs stored in DynamoDB are also encrypted at rest using AES-256 GCM encryption.\n\nWhat is really interesting, though, is that we don't even count on the security of the hashes in DynamoDB to guarantee that forwarded IDs are secure and anonymous. We actually count on a well simpler mechanism. We destroy information. The id sent to Google Analytics is random and doesn't carry any bit of relevant information.\n\nConcerning the linkability, we also publicly claim that we map the IID to OID and destroy the mapping after 24h. This is how we maintain the fundamental building blocks of Google Analytics (e.g., sessions, visitors, etc.). The true anonymization will be achieved after 24h; thank you for pointing that out; this is the core feature we are providing. After 24h, and as long as the data exists in Google Analytics, individuals are completely anonymous. During 24h, they are pseudo-anonymous, and as per recital 26 of GDPR, there is no means reasonably likely to be used to identify the actual individual neither. \n\nNevertheless, you have discovered a bug regarding the \"real\" TTL of a mapping in the worst case, where data can potentially remain in Kinesis during the maximum amount of 24h due to a technical consumption problem downstream and therefore added to the 24h of DynamoDB. We have already provided a [patch](https://github.com/priveraio/privera/commit/597b539). I have also thanked you in the commit message for having reported this issue, even though this process could have been simpler if reported directly on GitHub.\n\nA quick note concerning the 15min in the 24h15min of TTL. Note that the mapping is effectively destroyed after 24h as we change the hash key exactly after 24h; the TTL only concerns a technical point of how we need to drain the database. As far as security is concerned, we cannot compute the same hash anymore after exactly 24h.\n\nOne more time. Thank you very much for having expressed your concerns. I tried to address them as transparently as possible. Furthermore, if you think that our website's message can be improved, we are all ears.",

                "body": "Thank you so much for your thoughtful feedback.\n\nLet's summarize some fundamental aspects of the project as I see some misunderstanding about what's happening under the hood.\n\nFirst, apart from the identification part (hold on), we do not store any data at all. For instance, when we receive let say the title and the URL of the page, this data is not stored by us and is forwarded to the downstream service provider. We do not create any kind of profile, etc.\n\nNow, let's talk identity. \n\nThe hash includes the IP, the UA, and the API key. This API key is, for now, the UA property ID that serves as a \"silo\" id to separate data of the same user across websites. We can push it further, but without going into deep details here, it is the data controller's responsibility to fix the limit of the \"range\" of the identity of its users, and for now, it is tied to the property ID.\n\nThen, you \"don't think there's a strong value proposition in preventing third-party providers from linking an identifier to a data subject\" (the anonymization process from the processor's point of view). But you also see only half of the value proposition. In effect, we also prevent the data controller from linking a data subject to its data (the anonymization process from the controller's point of view). \n\nTo explain in more detail the identification process, you must also understand that this is a one-way process. And that's where its strength resides. As I said earlier, we do not store any PII, which means we store neither the IP nor the UA. So how it works? We hash the (IP, UA, API KEY) cryptographically and store the result (for 24h, but hold on). So if I give you a dump of the database or throw it in public today, it is implausible you can extract anything meaningful and certainly not the IP or the UA. But we go even further because what may be true today may change tomorrow. So we map this strong id to a random one. This way, we are literally \"destroying\" the underlying data. So even in the future, if someone has access to your data in your GA account, he literally can't retrieve any PII. But wait, now we, the proxy, become the bottleneck. That's where the 24h comes in. To mitigate any risks of data-breach, nothing lasts for more than 24h in our infrastructure. \n\nThe 24h has another side effect. We cannot track the same user's identity across days. Even though I can understand that your position may be different, we consider this a feature for individuals. This is an ideological standpoint and, as such, can be open to interpretation. However, we firmly think that we have to balance respecting users' privacy and conducting business efficiently. The 24h limit, we think, is the right balance. \n\nTo really summarize (my pretty dense answer). \n\nWe do not store PII. We are compliant with GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, etc. Our sole value proposition (sorry for the minimalism) is to make individuals completely anonymous while not breaking your GA.",

I will try to answer them in the same manner.\n\n\\- By using our service, you are not pseudonymizing your user info but anonymizing. This is a crucial distinction when it comes to proving that reidentification is impossible.\n\n\\- It is \"not possible\" to use GA without cookies. The loss of data quality you are talking about is in effect total. By removing the cookie, you are basically destroying the notion of visitor and thus destroying anything useful GA may be able to provide you.\n\n\\- If you run any fingerprinting process (active and browser-side or passive and server-side, you are swapping the cookie by another even stronger identity. And as long as you can retrieve this identity (by running your fingerprinting script at the next visit or by sending the id to GA) , then you fall in GDPR because you can reidentify a living individual. This is the most important feature we are providing. The anonymity of the user with regards to you, to GA, and even to us as we do not store anything that allows linking back to a living individual. \n\n\\- If a site operator considers self-hosting the CE, then you are doing well because you are providing the same kind of anonymization as us. The only difference is that in our CE the anonymization process does not rely on a strong entropy source while our saas version does. Using Matomo is different and complementary. We do not store or provide any statistics, we only provide anonymization. So you still need a service provider (GA, Matomo, etc). For now, we are launching with GA but we are also intending to add more providers in the future. You will be able to benefit from the wealth of functionalities of your provider of choice while ensuring anonymity and going out of the GDPR.\n\n\\- Your skepticism about the algorithm is understandable as I you're not yet :) used to its internals. Here are some details. We are \"key\" hashing a tuple composed of IP (low entropy), User agent (let say medium entropy), API key (let say low entropy) with a key of a minimum of 384 bits of entropy (let say OK). By design, this doesn't allow anyone in the current living world to make a brute force (actually a rainbow table) attack on this hash. But let say that it is possible in a post-quantum world! To even mitigate this risk, we are swapping the hash by a minimum of 384 bits of entropy random id that we forward to GA. So in any world at any time now or in the future, no one would be even able to do anything with this id. It is random and doesn't encode any data. Hope you're no more skeptical.",

And as the GDPR is some kind of fuzzy about this subject, let's focus on the upcoming ePrivacy.\n\nThe ePrivacy Directive (EPD) eventual replacement, the ePrivacy Regulation (EPR), will build upon the EPD and expand its definition. The proposed regulation has some key changes of interest here:\n\n\\- Browser fingerprinting: The rules on cookies will also apply to ‚Äúbrowser fingerprinting‚Äù, a process that seeks to uniquely identify users based on their browser configuration. (IP and user-agent being considered as \"passive\" browser fingerprinting)\n\n\\- Limited exception for analytics: There will be an exemption for website analytics, recognizing that this is not an intrusive activity. However, it will only apply to analytics carried out by the website provider. It is not clear if third-party analytic cookies, like Google Analytics, will benefit from this exemption.\n\nTakeaways: User-agent + IP is a kind of cookie.\n\nIn Opinion 01/2017, Article 29 Working party (‚ÄúWP29‚Äù) clarified that cookies are exempted from the requirement of express and informed consent by considering \"first party analytics cookies are not likely to create a privacy risk when they are strictly limited to first-party aggregated statistical purposes and anonymized.\n\nTakeaways: User-agent + IP does not require consent if used for statistics and anonymized.\n\nYou may now wonder why using Privera. After all, as per the above explanations, and should the revision of the EPR be deemed appropriate, express¬†and informed consent will not be required for first-party analytics?\n\nThe question is whether GA can be considered as an aggregated statistics and first-party analytics service? And it is all about anonymization.\n\nYou (the data controller) and GA (the data processor) are still able to \"identify\" individuals. A very concrete example is your capacity to single out users by some predicate and then use its cookie id (the \"cid\" that is available in clear in GA) to retarget the same user the next time he comes back to your website (as you also have the same cid as a first-party cookie on your website). Clearly, the user is not anonymous and you fall under the regulation (I'm not even talking about possibilities for Google to be able to reidentify users).\n\nNow with Privera, you are guaranteed to not be able to identify individuals as you don't have access to the way the hash of IP+ua is mapped to the \"cid\" you will find in your GA (and vice versa for GA). Moreover and as explained in another comment, we do not store any data neither and we cannot even rebuild the hash or find its mapping to the random cid as we destroy everything after 24h.\n\nThat is what we are all about here: providing anonymity.

Of course I can't verify your claims with respect to your hosted edition, which suffers from the problem that I'm merely exchanging one data processor with security claim (Google) with another data processor with certain security claims (Privera). Personally, HSMs are overkill for this use case.\n\nIn the open source/CE edition, you're using a cryptographically secure RNG (e.g. /dev/urandom on Linux), so that is truly secure as far as I am concerned for the ID passed to GA. This OID uses 128 bits which is totally sufficient in this context, though quite far from the claimed 384 bits of security.\n\nIt is worth noting that various intermediate IDs are created for storage in various Amazon services, in particular DynamodDB and Kinesis. These IDs are substantially weaker (e.g. due to use of MD5 or non-cryptographic RNGs for deriving keys), and these IDs can be linked with the secure OID. As long as this linkability exists, it would be unwise to assume that the OID were actually anonymized. The IID‚ÄìOID association has a TTL, so that true anonymization will be achieved after 24h 15min elapse since the Kinesis event is processed. The events may be pending in Kinesis for 24 hours, so that there might be up to 50 hours between the user's visit event and the onset of anonymization.",

While the resulting data in GA might still allow singling out in *some* cases using contextual information, your OID is an exceptionally strong form of anonymization. The 128 bits are more than enough.\n* My concerns about the IID generation do not impact the security of the overall scheme, under the assumption that the Proxy (and AWS) is trustworthy.\n* You provide clear arguments for the technical security of the scheme, though I don't necessarily agree with the details.\n\nI am somewhat confused though by the IID key, which you claim is inaccessible after 24 hours. In the dispatcher's Handle() method for the CE, I see the following code.\n\n\tseedh := sha256.New()\n\tio.WriteString(seedh, functionName)\n\tio.WriteString(seedh, time.Now().UTC().Format(\"2006-01-02\"))\n\thrand := mrand.New(mrand.NewSource(int64(binary.BigEndian.Uint64(seedh.Sum(nil)))))\n\tvar hkey [32]byte\n\t_, err := hrand.Read(hkey[:])\n\n* the `functionName` is known by the operator and is likely guessable\n* the YYYY-MM-DD date is predictable, and can be reconstructed at a later date (so the IID hash *can* be recomputed after 24 hours!)\n* `seedh.Sum(nil)` is a 256-bit hash\n* `int64(...)` extracts 64 bits from this\n* the 64-bit seed is used for a mathematical RNG, which is [remarkably poor and unusual](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21835) even for PRNGs of its class\n* 32 bytes (256 bits) are deterministically extracted from this RNG\n\nIt seems that the detour with mrand weakens the key to 64 bits, and this detour can be removed entirely. Also, the entropy is likely much lower than 64 bits as the function name + date are somewhat predictable. But again: this doesn't impact the security of this scheme. In principle, the whole IID concept could be removed entirely since you and your storage are trustworthy by definition ‚Äì simply using `IID = sha256(IP + UA + YYYYMMDD)` as a lookup key for the current OID would have almost identical security properties to your current solution, and you might not even need a cryptographic hash function.\n\nI'm discussing that here instead of GH because I'm not sure about your security goals for the CE. While I can read the code, I cannot infer intention without some kind of documentation (code comments, architecture documentation, security whitepaper, ‚Ä¶).\n\nAs another potential bug regarding IIDs, consider that the IID‚ÄìOID mapping has a 24:15 hour TTL, but that the IID will change at UTC midnight. This will break GA sessions around UTC midnight. Considering traffic patterns, it is more likely that visitors from the middle east will keep their IDs for a full day, whereas the change would occur during high-traffic periods in the US. Rotating the IID key at 3AM local time for the geolocation derived from the IP could be a great feature for your EE.\n\nI also think that your use of DynamoDB has a race condition, though again it will not affect the security of this scheme, at most lead to a small data quality loss. **I would not fix this.** Assume a new visitor that generates multiple events over a short timeframe. Assume *two* lambda instances consuming Kinesis events, so that both instances each get an event involving the user. Both instances will generate their own random OID and will keep using it for all events of that user within the batch. Both will write the OID to DynamoDB, and it's not clear to me which write would win. Thus, there will be at most 20 (batchsize) events in GA with the wrong Client ID. The split could persist even across sequential lambda invocations due to DynamoDB's eventual consistency. In practice, this shouldn't matter unless the database is distributed across multiple AWS regions.",

I will try to address each of your new remarks even though it is indubitably out of any interest for a non-technical audience who may read this :)  IMHO discussing in GitHub would benefit a broader audience. Anyway.\n\nConcerning your confusion about our claim that the IID is inaccessible after 24 hours.  \nYour whole reasoning starts with \"the functionName is known by the operator and is likely guessable\". It is not true. We use the function name as a viable random component in CE because when you deploy the provided infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, then AWS append a random suffix to the function name.  \nThis provides the first component of the hash key that is **random** but **stable across function invocations**.  \nTo reset the hash key after 24h, now we need another component that deterministically changes after 24h. Nothing better than the current timestamp truncated to the day.  \nNext, you talk about the quality of the resulting key. As I've already overly discussed this subject, in CE, this is the best we can achieve given the aforementioned constraints and the absence of other entropy sources. Note that this whole key generation part is replaced by a random key generated daily by the HSM in the hosted version. Moreover, any CE contribution is more than welcome if you want to provide one that complies with the constraints.\n\nOur security goals about CE are nothing out of the ordinary.  It must be as secure as possible, and as I said previously, anyone can contribute to fixes, improvements, documentation, etc. It is an open-source project.\n\nConcerning the singling-out remark. When using Google Analytics as is, you collect a lot of contextual information about the user (e.g., screen size, plugin versions, etc.). So your risk of singling out an individual is more than a theoretical risk, to not say elevated. Moreover, outside this contextual info, your users' cookie id is available in clear in Google Analytics for days. You can single out and target a particular individual if needed.  \nIn Privera, we adopted a way more frugal approach. Thus, you roughly end up with random ids and page views. We estimate the absolute and relative risk of singling-out an individual to be ridiculously low. If you want to dig into this specific subject, I recommend this paper on the [formalization of the GDPR‚Äôs notion of singling out](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/15/8344) (also referenced publicly on our website).  \n\n\nConcerning your remarks about sessions breakage. We are aware of this current limitation, and we did it on purpose. This initial version is an MVP and couldn't reasonably come out fully featured. We will provide ASAP an option to associate a timezone to the GA property ID (as currently possible in GA) both in the hosted and in the CE version. This way, the data controller will have the expected session stability. That said, thank you for pointing this out.\n\nConcerning the possible race condition on DynamoDB. Your reasoning starts with \"assume two lambda instances consuming Kinesis events\". It is not possible. Do you remember the MD5 hash of the partition key? In short, the way Kinesis works and the way we distribute data into it strongly guarantees that any event coming from a particular touchpoint will be stored on a well-known shard and will be processed sequentially by a single and well-known instance of a Lambda. By construction, we get the best balance between parallel processing of different touchpoints and sequential processing of the same touchpoint. Moreover, when processing the incoming stream of events from a particular touchpoint, we use the \"qt\" (queue time) parameter provided by GA measurement protocol to ensure that GA ingests events in order.  \nI won't go into the details of a multi-region deployment as it is obviously out of scope here. But keep in mind that it can be achieved with DynamoDB global tables and streams.  \n\n\nI think that I've addressed your new concerns and hope to see you star the GitHub repo as you seem to be more than intrigued by the project. :)",

I like bashing Fathom a lot because they have lots of boisterous marketing material, but Fathom's claims are much harder to verify, and some are probably wrong (e.g. their claim that user hashes ‚Äì which correspond to your IIDs ‚Äì were already anonymous).\n\nI might find the time later this year to implement a similar tool, though with different security and deployment assumptions (e.g. I really want to get rid of daily keys, and would like to use more probabilistic approaches in order to provide formal security guarantees.

With our work, we showed how we addressed those challenges, and this is generalisable. You should also note that these challenges are the real industrial challenges in practice, which most of the works do not address (or only partially compared to ours).  \n2. System design and implementation is a large topic in and of itself, posing a unique set of challenges that many industries and academics are still grappling with today. I am not going to get into it right now, but I would say that system design and implementation are just as critical as any other task.¬†For example, what is the value of your modelling if it cannot be implemented in practice?¬†Having said that, I do not minimise the importance of modelling.  Regarding what's new, I would say the approach and the implementation¬†itself. For example, the use of Next Generation Access Control (NGAC [https://standards.incits.org/apps/group\\_public/project/details.php?project\\_id=2328](https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=2328)  )-based policy mechanisms (i.e., customised and enhanced) and other methodologies for secure implementations, such as deterministic layered-encryption techniques other than compliance checking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's getting a little long, so I'll just sum it up here. Our work provides a new approach and implementation to deal with the GDPR challenges in practice, taking best practices and tools from experts ranging from security, and semantics to law. In other words, it provides the best of both worlds: privacy and law.",

Since cookies or LocalStorage are stored on the user's device, setting cookies generally requires consent. Analytics are not strictly necessary for displaying a website.\n\nIt is only access to information on a device that matters here, not whether such information is combined with other identifiers. Thus, cookie consent is still necessary when truncating the IP address.\n\nTwo of the three sites you link (nomadlist, actualbudget) don't even seem to have a privacy policy ‚Äì though there might be an argument that they are not subject to GDPR and ePrivacy. Analytics compliance *is* a concern for GDPR & ePrivacy compliance, but it has comparatively low priority (also low priority for supervisory authorities). Improper cookie consent is very very common, including here on Reddit.\n\nSo what should you do?\n\n* Collecting data is a liability. Limit data collection to what is actually necessary. Some kinds of analytics (e.g. counting pageviews) are possible without using cookies or IP addresses.\n* Concentrate on GDPR compliance for your core business activities. In particular:\n  * think through basic compliance questions for your processing activities: what is the purpose of processing, what is the Art 6 legal basis for processing, and what is the minimal amount of data necessary to achieve the purpose?\n  * write a privacy policy (see Art 13, Art 15 GDPR)\n  * make sure subcontractors are bound as data processors as appropriate (Art 28 GDPR), including sorting out international transfers\n  * take appropriate steps to ensure security of processing, including general infosec best practices and making backups\n* If you have time, consider sorting out non-essential activities. E.g. chat widgets on a website are currently very popular, but sorting out compliance can be more effort than they are worth.\n\nAnalytics are tricky because some analytics are often business-essential, whereas large amounts of data collected by common analytics solutions are entirely superfluous. But I think GA can be configured appropriately with reasonable effort. For example, these steps might contribute:\n\n* enable IP anonymization\n* deactivate cookie storage unless you want to implement a consent solution\n  * how to do that depends on how you load GA, here's the guide for analytics.js: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookies-user-id#disabling_cookies\n  * gtag.js has similar functionality under the `client_storage` config key, but this is undocumented\n* implement an opt-out solution, potentially accessible through your privacy policy (it's fine to use cookies to remember an opt-out: strictly necessary)\n* sign the DPA and SCCs in the GA settings\n* DO NOT enable data sharing with Google, such as for demographic data\n* if you have time, consider implementing opt-in to cookies, taking into account the conditions for consent in Art 7 GDPR\n  * if you're a web developer, doing this yourself is likely better than using a third party provider, unless you also want to show ads on your website\n* document the use of analytics in your privacy policy, perhaps using legitimate interest or consent as the legal basis (depending on whether you actually collect consent)\n\nYou do not have to show a cookie banner as mere notification, but you might use banners with a yes/no button in order collect consent.

This stopped being compliant in 2018 when the definition of consent was updated. Under the GDPR definition, consent must be an unambiguous, affirmative action. Continuing to use a site is not unambiguous. Also, pre-ticked checkboxes aren't OK (see the Planet 49 case mentioned elsewhere). Finally, consent must be specific to a purpose, so a user should be able to consent or decline consent for analytics separately from ad personalization or whatever.\n\nSo unfortunately, if you want consent you will need to show a banner or other user interface element, and will have to provide an actual choice. Since this messes with your bounce rate and data quality, I'd suggest considering cookie-less analytics.\n\nYou're correct that the vast majority of sites has dubious to flat out illegal cookie consent practices, but as I mentioned this is not a priority for anyone. But this complacency is dangerous as it opens up liability.\n\nData processing agreements are not optional, but a very crucial compliance step when outsourcing data processing activities. Sometimes they are part of normal service contracts, often they require ticking a checkbox in an admin panel. If they don't offer a DPA they're probably trash anyway. If your startup wants to sell B2B services, offering a DPA to customers is just as important as having a VAT ID.\n\nFor your privacy policy, you may want to go through Art 13 and Art 15 of the GDPR, as they almost contain a checklist of required items. E.g. you should enumerate the data subject rights (access, erasure, portability, ‚Ä¶) even if they don't apply. The UK's ICO also offers very good guides, even though they're no longer part of the EU.\n\nI'm not a lawyer but more of a dev as well, so I understand how overwhelming compliance can be. The good news is that GDPR compliance requires a one-time effort to write a privacy policy etc, but then has acceptably low cost going forward (e.g. starting to use a new subcontractor? Ok, sign the usual DPA with them and potentially update your privacy policy, done). In the end, this is just a part of doing business, like sales or taxes.",

In a clinical setting, there might be issues if treatment would be withheld unless consent to participate in a study is given.\n\nBut the ‚Äúno detriment‚Äù rule does not mean that consenting vs non-consenting data subjects must be treated exactly equally. In its [guidelines to consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en), the EDPB mentions in passing the concept of a ‚Äúpermissible incentive‚Äù for consent.

Such a voucher could even *help* ensuring a truly free choice, in the sense that the voucher also serves as compensation for the time spent on participating in the survey, balancing out the drawback for participating in the study.

You're probably storing them in a way that relates to particular accounts, or the original account could be found via a reverse image search.\n\n* Since it's personal data, you will need a legal basis per Art 6(1) GDPR.\n\n* Consent (Art 6(1)(a) GDPR) always works. But since you're not in contact with the data subjects, you can't ask for consent first.\n\n* Personal data can also be processed under a legitimate interest (Art 6(1)(f) GDPR), so on an opt-out basis. But this only works if your legitimate interest outweighs the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject. This requires conducting a balancing test. Recital 47 GDPR provides more guidance on conducting such a balancing test:\n\n  > Such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. \n\n  But here, there is no relevant relationship between the data subjects (accounts) and your platform. The data subjects cannot ‚Äúreasonably expect‚Äù that you'll scrape this data. At most, such an argument could be done for very high profile accounts that are effectively public figures. So I think that a legitimate interest balancing test would generally fail.\n\nA non-GDPR aspect that should also be considered is the copyright in the profile pictures. Since you don't have a contract with the data subjects, you have not received a license to use those images. And European copyright laws generally don't have a broad ‚Äúfair use‚Äù exception that could apply here. At most, the social media platforms you're scraping might provide you with a necessary license, but I'd doubt it.",

In practice, yes.\n\n‚Äú[Contracts of adhesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_form_contract#Contracts_of_adhesion)‚Äù like most terms of service are a ‚Äútake it or leave it‚Äù document that create a large imbalance between the company/drafter and the consumer. Thus, many countries are going to have consumer protection laws that state you can't sneak anything surprising in there.\n\nThe GDPR concept of ‚Äúconsent‚Äù tries to avoid these problems. Consent is defined to be a ‚Äúfreely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject‚Äôs wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her‚Äù (Art 4(11) GDPR). And per Art 7(2), requests for consent must be clearly distinguishable from other matters ‚Äì they cannot be hidden in a larger document.\n\nHere, the relevant aspect is that consent must be specific, informed, and unambiguous. If the data subject doesn't know what they consented to, then the consent wasn't sufficiently informed and is therefore *invalid*. If consent is sought for multiple distinct purposes, a ‚Äúconsent to all‚Äù button might also be too unspecific and too ambiguous for obtaining valid consent. The very first layer of a consent flow should directly summarize the purposes for which consent is sought.\n\nSo far, the theory.\n\nIn practice, consent management tools are not just used for cookie consent, but for a variety of processing purposes ranging from fairly harmless analytics cookies, to more invasive ad personalization, cross-site tracking, embedding third party content, and sometimes even international data transfers. These tools are so complex that there's almost certainly something hidden in there that user's wouldn't expect when clicking on ‚Äúaccept all‚Äù. So it's quite likely that a lot of sneaky things are being done here.\n\nFor further details on how GDPR consent is supposed to work, consider reading the [EDPB guidelines on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en). Section 3.3 of that document discusses when consent is sufficiently informed. If you're in the UK, the [ICO website includes guidelines on consent](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/what-is-valid-consent/).\n\nWhile cookies and similar technologies always require consent because the ePrivacy Directive (UK: PECR) says so, other processing activities might not need consent. For example, data processing is also legal if it is necessary for fulfilling a contract with the data subject. Notably, Facebook attempted the argument that per its terms of service (that Facebook had written itself), Facebook was contractually bound to deliver personalized ads to users. How convenient, since this avoided the need to ask users for consent. But this is not a good argument. As mentioned, terms of service cannot contain surprising terms. Immediately when the GDPR came into force, NOYB initiated complaints against this. Back in 2019, and presumably in reaction to the NOYB cases, the [EDPB published guidelines on the use of contractual necessity as a legal basis](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-22019-processing-personal-data-under-article-61b_en), pointing out that something doesn't just become necessary for providing a service just because a contract says so. But, according to a [NOYB update from 2021](https://noyb.eu/en/irish-dpc-greenlights-facebooks-gdpr-bypass), the Irish DPC doesn't feel like following the EDPB's guidelines :)",

It's all just in memory and not in any kind of persistent storage so when the page's last tab is closed the session id is lost forever.\n\nPlease let me know if I just wrote something totally useless.

(Note that consent is not *necessarily* an obligation. GDPR on its own, without ePD, might allow website analytics to use Legitimate Interest as its Legal Basis, assuming you're not enabling the features that connect it to other data sources or using it for advertising.) This implementation has a higher chance than other approaches I've seen, but still not guaranteed.\n\nWhat data is sent to the first-party back-end?

In dense areas, IP blocks down to /24 are often attributed to specific geographical areas, and will further allow you to identify the ISP and other data points that could lead to re-identification. If you really want the region, you should get a list of non-personal IPs per region, do the geo-ip lookup with reverse geocoding, and then replace the IP with a region one that has nothing to do with the user.\n\nConcerning the ePrivacy Directive and GDPR, you will still need opt-in consent for this activity, regardless of whether you anonymize the data or not. In your privacy policy you can be clear that the data used for statistical purposes is anonymized, which may mean that more people opt in to it, but you're still effectively processing the data for a secondary purpose of processing, so whatever consent you obtained for engaging with the site itself is insufficient for covering this.

        "selftext": "Hi. It's the second time I post here. I've made a lot of research since then but still can't quite understand how the end user could tell if a website's cookie policy breaks the GDPR.\n\nThird party cookies, other than strictly necessary ones, require a user's consent (ePrivacy). Also, if the cookie contains a unique identifier, it needs to be treated as personal data, and therefore also requires a consent (GDPR). Advertising companies assign unique identifiers to publisher's website users via these cookies so they can create a user profile and display more relevant ads.\n\nNow, let's say that a website has no cookie banners (doesn't ask for consent) and still allows ad-related third party cookies to be installed in the end user's browser. The cookie is called 'ID', comes from an advertising company domain and contains a string of random lettes. Obviously this breaks the ePrivacy rule about consent to cookies that are not strictly necessary and it's easy to spot. But how can I tell if this string of random letters is my own identifier? It could very well mean nothing and just be random letters, how to prove that it actually goes against the GDPR?\n\nOne more thing. There is a website called [2gdpr.com](https://2gdpr.com) that automatically scan your website looking for ePrivacy/GDPR breaches. I've \"scanned\" many popular urls and it took me a while to find one that has all the 5 check fields green. It's quite worrying but at the same time, how are websites getting away with it? Is \"legitimate interest\" basically a get out of jail card?\n\nThanks for your answers in advance.",

Consent is only one possibly condition out of six that allows personal data to be processed lawfully. Consent is not necessary in general to process data.\n\nIn this particular situation, since we're already talking about non-essential cookies which require consent because of ePD, then you'll probably use consent for other processing. It's not necessarily impossible to use a different legal basis for that processing, but it's difficult and awkward.\n\n> But how can I tell if this string of random letters is my own identifier? It could very well mean nothing and just be random letters, how to prove that it actually goes against the GDPR?\n\nThe company is obligated to inform you of the purpose and meaning of the cookies. If you don't already know, then it's a GDPR violation for insufficient transparency, regardless of what they're actually using it for.\n\nTo find out more, send a Data Subject Access Request (per Article 15) asking what data is associated with that identifier. I could have sworn that GDPR includes an obligation to follow through with DSARs on pseudonymous identifiers, but I can't find it write now; perhaps it's a court interpretation of the obligation to \"facilitate\" such requests.\n\nIt's not possible in general to know the semantic meaning of an arbitrary string of characters. The same numeric code could be a personal identifier in one system, and the SKU of an item in your cart on another system. I don't trust fully-automated systems to be complete in this regard.\n\n> how are websites getting away with it?\n\nData protection authorities are under-resourced and have to pick their battles.",

To comply with the GDPR you need to have some internal documents and procedures however, for which companies tend to hire legal advisors. I guess this type of service starts at ~500‚Ç¨, but can easily exceed it. \n\nBut it's quite easy to do yourself. Read a few GDPR compliance guides and checklists and you should have a reasonable understanding of what's expected. You basically need to:\n- describe your goals and justify what personal data you're processing and why\n- do a privacy impact assessment\n- appoint a GDPR compliance officer\n- create internal data protection policies and ensure everybody with access understands internal and legal requirements \n- create procedures for requesting and exporting, updating and removal of your customers data and describe them in your privacy policy (these functions can be automated but you can also point them to an email address)\n- create procedures to notify authorities and subjects in case of a data breach\n- sign data processing agreements with 3rd parties if they process personal information or if you're processing their data\n\nIt might seem excessive but once you're used to the jargon it's fairly easy, and you can reuse 95% of it. Also don't forget to charge your customers for this, most SMBs only need to add a little info about their other/analog operations to all this to be compliant.\n\nAnd my final advice is to not go to deep or worry to much about it. Since you're a small player they won't audit you (I believe they only audit organizations with 50 or so employees or millions of revenue), and if they do they'll check if you're aware and have your documentation ready but probably won't scrutinize the actual implementation. I've been involved in fiscal audits and even then auditors usually are pretty understanding if they feel like you tried to comply and are willing to follow up on their feedback.",

The four questions raise fundamental doubts over the legality of  Facebook's data use of all EU customers. \n\nIn parallel, the Austrian Supreme Court also decided in a  partial judgment that Mr Schrems will receive ‚Ç¨ 500 in symbolic  emotional damages because Facebook did not give full access to Mr  Schrems' data, but instead staged an \"egg hunt\" for user data.\n\nRead more: [https://noyb.eu/en/breaking-austrian-ogh-asks-cjeu-if-facebook-undermines-gdpr-2018](https://noyb.eu/en/breaking-austrian-ogh-asks-cjeu-if-facebook-undermines-gdpr-2018)",

Another entry is added with new data (pr, method, wd) If the procedure of cancellation is stopped by the user.\n\nnow my question is: when I run the procedure to delete his account I need to leave the entry in the table or can I delete it directly? \n\n(the website is going to be accessible only by our country and it's not the UK, and the cancellation of every data is the default procedure when you ask to terminate your account).\n\nThank you for your reading this.",

Usually, Art 6(1)(b) (necessity for performance of a contract) will be a more suitable legal basis for most services.\n2. The Art 17 right to erasure is not absolute. It has many conditions and exceptions. If you have a good reason to keep the data beyond account deletion, you can probably do that.\n3. When managing consent, a main consideration will be Art 7(2): ‚Äúthe controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data‚Äù. This often requires keeping such records, and may require keeping such records for some specified period after consent was withdrawn, in case there's any legal dispute about this. But the GDPR doesn't provide any fixed retention periods, and the controller can choose whatever period they consider appropriate.\n4. The GDPR never expects agreement to a privacy policy. The GDPR does expect certain information to be provided, but that's just a notice to the data subjects. It doesn't need to be acknowledged by the user. Asking for explicit acceptance of a privacy notice could create the wrong impression that you're indeed relying on consent as a legal basis, which would greatly restrict how you can process the data.",

For example, consent to personalized ads might make it possible to provide personalized discounts, with non-personalized discounts being available without that consent. Note that with such scenarios, the burden of proof is on the data controller to show that consent was obtained in a compliant manner.\n\nFor a more authoritative discussion of these matters, read the [EDPB guidelines on consent (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en), in particular section 3.1.4 Detriment.

On the matter of incentives, the ICO writes:\n\n> The ICO‚Äôs view is that it may still be possible to incentivise consent to some extent. There will usually be some benefit to consenting to processing. For example, if joining the retailer‚Äôs loyalty scheme comes with access to money-off vouchers, there is clearly some incentive to consent to marketing. The fact that this benefit is unavailable to those who don‚Äôt sign up does not amount to a detriment for refusal. However, you must be careful not to cross the line and unfairly penalise those who refuse consent.",

So with that in mind the answer to your question is a no.The question does spark further interesting questions.

I did have a quick search through Googles docs but found nothing specific - in Google's case I believe that to be by design.  Public interest has been mentioned as a candidate but I doubt it as well - they could maybe get away with it in some EU members states, but all of them?...\n\nReading some of the replies here however makes me think that some respondents need to go re-read the GDPR and start from scratch with the definition for 'personal data'\n\nAn address where someone lives, officially registered or not, is personal data.Personal data remains personal data whether it is data that directly identifies or can be used in combination with other data to identify a natural person.\n\nIn my opinion the satelite image / aerial photo itself is capturing 'location data' which is personal data so Google needs to have a legal basis,  provide proper information & provide a way to opt out & object as per the lawfulness, fairness & transparency obligation.  But the current situation is not that.  The legal basis is not clear, information is not given in a clear and transparent way (not to mention before/at the moment/as soon as possible after collection), you can have streetview images blurred by Google but I am not certain if that is the case for top down satelite / aerial photographs.",

In the ICO's illustration there is a large 'accept' button and an inconspicuous 'more information' hidden at the bottom. Clearly this doesn't offer freely given consent.\n\nBut this is not the same as the OP's format. He would have 2 equally sized buttons: one 'accept all' and one 'change preferences'. On a reasonable interpretation, this format **does** offer an easy way for the user to make a choice.\n\nAt most we could say that the law remains ambiguous on this point until such time as case law clarifies the situation. But until then, it's jumping the gun to say unequivocally that the OP's format is unlawful.\n\nI'd also make a more practical point: the ICO does not have the resources or inclination to investigate individual organisations skating in cookie law grey areas, not least in the case of very small organisations (like the OP's. Im guessing). Many 1000s of UK organisations adopt the OP's cookie format. There is, at present, almost no risk to the OP in adopting his proposed cookie format.",

Clearly, ticking a checkbox is one possible way how a data subject can unambiguously indicate their wishes. This section says that browsers or other software can manage consent as well.\n\nBut this does not affect the conditions for consent, especially Art 7 GDPR. In particular: consent must be specific and informed. It is not possible to consent to ‚Äúcookies‚Äù. Consent should relate to a particular *purpose* instead.   With common browsers, the only choice users have is ‚Äúallow all cookies‚Äù vs ‚Äúblock third party cookies‚Äù. But there are no options to make choices like ‚Äúallow cookies if they are strictly necessary, or if they are used solely for analytics purposes, or if they are set by twitter.com, but block any other cookies‚Äù.\n\nIn some cases, browsers do offer suitable consent management. E.g. if a website wants to access your camera, microphone, or location information, you'll get a consent popup from your browser. Similar features are integrated into mobile operating systems. Per the quoted PECR part, that is a potentially valid mechanism to manage consent.\n\nNevertheless, consent must be informed. These browser-supported consent mechanisms do not typically provide enough context to make an informed decision, so I don't think they are generally sufficient for valid consent by themselves.\n\nThe Web does not currently have suitable technologies through which websites can indicate for which purposes they use a cookie or other features, and have no way to provide information necessary for an informed decision. Well, other than the classic way of showing a cookie banner.\n\n> To my (uneducated) eyes, this reads that if a browser settings are configured to *accept* cookies (as is the default) that this is good enough for consent under PECR.\n\nNope, that does not look like it would fulfil the conditions for valid consent. A default setting can never constitute consent because there was no ‚Äúclear affirmative action‚Äù by the data subject.",

                "body": "P.S.: Incidentally, this is why the Do Not Track standard sank. Browsers can indicate to websites whether the users wishes to be tracked. This setting has three states (yes/no/indeterminate). Next to no websites use this information because it isn't clear what ‚Äúdo not track‚Äù is supposed to mean, and since there is no legal obligation to honour it. But if this setting was present, it at least was an unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes. Then Internet Explorer 10 decided to activate DNT *by default*. This caused the tracking industry to essentially say: oh no, we don't know if the user *really* wanted to ~opt-out from tracking~ *get less relevant ads*, so we'll better ignore this setting. Thus, DNT became even less relevant.\n\nThe Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a more recent iteration on this idea with only two states (privacy signal/indeterminate). Unlike DNT, it received some legal backing: it is a valid *and binding* ‚Äúdo not sell my personal information‚Äù signal under the CCPA. But I have severe doubts whether this can have any effect in a GDPR context. The GPC draft spec (2021-12-16) says:\n\n> The GDPR requires that \"Natural persons should have control of their own personal data\" ([GDPR], Recital 7). The GPC signal is intended to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user's personal data to other data controllers ([GDPR] Articles 7 & 21). This request is expressed with every interaction that the user agent has with the server.\n>\n> Note that this request is not meant to withdraw a user's consent to local storage as per the ePrivacy Directive (\"cookie consent\") ([EPRIVACY-DIRECTIVE]) nor is it intended to object to direct marketing under legitimate interest ([GDPR]).\n\nSo essentially: it would be nice if this causes websites to do some privacy-positive things, but it's totally unclear what it's supposed to mean (except that it doesn't affect consent status).",

                "body": "You are in essence asking if illegally collected data can be used legally. I think this is a tricky question that also depends on what other lawful use is being proposed. In some cases, it may be possible to argue that the two processing activities are separate so that failing to obtain a valid legal basis for one activity doesn't affect the other. But in general, it will be difficult to argue that illegally acquired data can be used legally. Consent does not allow use for a different purpose, and failing to obtain required consent must not result in more rights to the controller. I also think that a legitimate interest balancing test would generally fail in such a context.\n\n## Breaking the law can't be better than adhering to it.\n\nFirst, lets consider what happens if valid consent had been obtained, as is legally required in the case of analytics cookies. Per the purpose limitation principle in GDPR Art 5(1)(b),\n\n> Personal data shall be [‚Ä¶] collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes\n\nIf personal data is collected for purpose A we can only use it for purpose A, or a purpose B if B is compatible with A. Art 6(4) provides criteria to determine whether two purposes are compatible. But these criteria do not apply when the legal basis was consent. **Consent is always specific to a purpose**, so there cannot be a compatible purpose outside of consent (though I would argue that vital interests and legal obligations could override the consent purpose limitation).\n\nBreaking the law must not produce more beneficial outcomes than adhering to it. If consent is legally required, then failing to obtain consent cannot allow more uses of the data than if everything had been done by the book.\n\n## Separate legal bases for separate purposes.\n\nBut here the crux is that we must consider for what consent has been obtained. The ePrivacy directive (and national implementations like the PECR) require consent for accessing or storing information on the end user's device, where such access or storage is not strictly necessary to perform a service explicitly requested by the end user. In the context of analytics, we need consent to store a pseudonymous client ID on the end users device, for example by placing a cookie. We arguably also need consent to access JavaScript APIs for collecting analytics metrics, such as screen size or collecting data for fingerprinting.\n\nWhereas we need consent for placing cookies and collecting analytics data, we don't necessarily need that consent for subsequent processing of the data. It may be possible to argue that these are distinct processing activities that can be covered by separate legal bases. Then, a failure to obtain a valid legal basis for activity A might not affect the legality of activity B.\n\n## Deletion obligations when data has been processed unlawfully.\n\nAnother wrinkle in this matter is that unlawfully processed data should be deleted. To my surprise the GDPR doesn't say that if data has been collected illegally, then it must be deleted. Instead, data subjects can request erasure if their data has been processed unlawfully (Art 17(1)(d)), and supervisory authorities can order deletion (Art 58(2)).\n\n## Legitimate interest balancing test.\n\nWhen claiming a legitimate interest, it is necessary to perform a suitable balancing test that weighs the claimed legitimate interest against the rights and freedoms of the affected persons. Per Recital 47, criteria for this balancing test include ‚Äúthe reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller‚Äù. If the data controller is performing a processing activity for which a data subject would reasonably expect a consent request first, it will be difficult to show that a legitimate interest exists.\n\n## Counterexamples\n\nThe GDPR has broad exemptions from the purpose limitation principle for ‚Äúarchiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes‚Äù, subjects to safeguards per Art 89. Analytics tend to involve statistics so maybe there's an argument here, but at least Google Analytics allows way too fine-grained profiling for its reports to benefit from this exemption.\n\nI can also imagine scenarios (outside of the analytics context) where there is a strong legitimate interest to process unlawfully obtained data. For example, I'd argue that the HIBP data breach notification service is not prohibited by the GDPR from processing leaked and breached data. This is similar in that most data used by HIPB has become available by illegal means, but dissimilar in that the illegal and legal processing activities have been undertaken by different controllers.",

In the US, the FCC set up an 'abuse@fcc.gov' email address specifically for citizens to use when signing up for things where they did not consent to marketing communications, for example. If your employees are filling things out simply to satisfy form validation requirements and do not require ready access to the mail inbox, a similar approach could also be used here.

When I signed the contract, I opted not to tick the box for marketing emails/texts/etc. When GDPR hit, they never contacted me to get consent to marketing emails. As far as I recall, I've never been sent marketing emails from them directly.\n\nA few days ago, I got a text from the dealership asking me to trade in my car for a new car; they'd give me a great deal, etc etc. It was a number that didn't support replies and I couldn't opt-out of receiving more messages, so I ignored it. \n\nToday, I got an email (from the same salesman I bought my car off of in 2017) saying:\n\n>\"Hi (my name), Thank you for your interest in (car brand). I am delighted to attach a copy of your recent quotation along with my contact details. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\"\n\nAttached was an actual quotation that had all of my details and all the details of a brand new car with a repayments schedule, as if I had requested this in-store or over the phone. \n\nBecause it was from the same car salesman it didn't seem like spam, so I was worried that somehow my details were leaked and this was a fake quote or someone trying to impersonate me or something. I replied to say I've no interest in a new car and didn't ask for a quote. The salesman replied saying: \n\n>\"We‚Äôve sent out a text earlier just to see would you have any interest in trading in your car, so just wanted to follow up with a few figures to see if you wanted to change.\"\n\nBased on his response, it seems like this is some kind of marketing tactic to get me to trade up? Now, I'm going to reply asking to be removed from whatever mailing list I'm on and hopefully that's the end of it. I'm just curious about the following:\n\n* Is this sort of thing allowed under GDPR? I never consented to getting marketing emails or texts from the dealership, can they add me to their mailing list without consent if I was an existing customer? Even if I didn't opt in at the time I signed the contract? \n* Raising a fake quotation and sending it to a customer as if they requested it seems very shady to me, but does it actually violate GDPR?

The advice on there is mostly fine, but it seems you were slightly confused by it.\n\nWhile the GDPR defines the concept of ‚Äúconsent‚Äù, it does not provide specific rules on cookies. Instead, we must look at the ePrivacy Directive (ePD), which particularizes and complements the GDPR. As an EU directive, every EU member state has its own implementation, but the directive sets a common baseline.\n\nThe `gdpr.eu` page correctly says that you don't need consent for strictly necessary cookies. This mirrors Art 5 ePD, that says that you don't need consent for accessing or storing information on the user's device if this is strictly necessary for providing a service explicitly requested by the user. \n\nWhen the user explicitly selects a particular UI theme, then it seems strictly necessary to store that selection so that it persists across page loads. Then, no consent or cookie banner would be necessary. Without consent, there's nothing to document. It would still be sensible to disclose the use of these cookies e.g. as part of a privacy notice.",

That type of consent won‚Äôt be valid as it isn‚Äôt freely given.  Arguably by doing so the controller is basing all of their processing on consent, and so all of the processing would lack a legal basis \n\nConsent cannot legitimise processing that would otherwise be unlawful, ie it‚Äôs not ok to process personal data in violation of the GDPR because the data subject has given consent, the processing would still be unlawful even though the data subject agreed to it.  Consent is just one of a number of legal bases in that is available, and the processing must still be fair and lawful (and comply with the other DP principles) when consent is the legal basis.\n\nRegarding sharing personal data, that is a form of processing like any other, so a legal basis is required to do it.  The question is, is there a legitimate interest in the sharing that outweighs any negative impact of the processing in data subjects?  Data subject expectations, how the data will be used, and the purpose of the sharing will be key here.  If not, then the only real option to share the data would be to obtain consent",

I'm skeptical about their GDPR claims. Additionally, their statements about the functionality of GA have some factual errors.\n\n[ICO's cookie guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies/#cookies5) would imply that IP address (\"data exposed by the use of particular network protocols\") is covered by PECR and falls under the same regulation. You don't need consent to use IP address to serve a webpage because using the IP is \"strictly necessary\" for that service. However [analytics is explicitly called out](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-the-rules-on-cookies-and-similar-technologies/#rules10) as not meeting \"strictly necessary.\" Combined, these would indicate that Matomo is not exempt in ICO's opinion.\n\nOther regulators have more-or-less said that GA is OK. The Dutch regulator even has a guide on how to make GA compliant, which doesn't require too much beyond the out-of-the-box configuration (it's more focused on things *not* to do).\n\nRegarding specific claims:\n\n> the data is not used for any other purpose than analytics (compared to GA which uses it for other purposes and therefore always requires consent)\n\nFirst, analytics purposes requires consent according to some regulators. Second, GA can be used for analytics alone. I don't believe that the consent will depend on whether it *could* be used for other purposes, but whether it *actually is* used for other purposes. \n\n> visitors aren‚Äôt tracked across websites (compared to GA which does track visitors across many websites)\n\nBy default GA does not track across websites. There are configuration options that enable this, but again there's a difference between the *capability* and the *actual usage*.\n\nI'm also having trouble seeing why they believe you need to mention Matomo in your privacy policy, but claim that the data it processes doesn't count as personal data. That seems contradictory. If it's not personal data, then GDPR doesn't have any requirements to put it in your privacy policy; if it's in your privacy policy, it's because you believe it's personal data.\n\nUltimately if you have concerns I would run them by your *own* counsel rather than relying on Matomo's marketing material.",

(I use Google Analytics in such a configuration myself.) The issue I have with Matomo's suggestion is that a daily changing fingerprint is still an identifier for that day, so that the GDPR's concept of anonymization is probably not fulfilled.\n\nWhether accessing device details with JavaScript to create a high-fidelity fingerprint is cookie-like is subject to debate, but the consensus seems to be that such fingerprints are equivalent to cookies when considering ePrivacy. I hope that a court would take a more nuanced approach, e.g. by making a distinction between technical data such as the screen resolution and invasive fingerprinting such as canvas fingerprinting, or extracting the list of installed fonts.\n\nI don't think that the use of JavaScript is a problem in itself.

Since no client-side storage is used, a new Client ID is generated upon each page load. When a user navigates to a different page, they appear as a new visitor. Per the GA terms of service, I'm not allowed to stitch sessions although it might technically be possible based on timestamp + truncated IP + user agent. This setup is slightly more privacy-preserving than Matomo's fingerprint based solution, which allows sessions to be tracked during one day.\n\nI believe that disabling Client ID storage and enabling the anonymize-IP option is sufficient to run analytics without asking for consent: there is no access to information on terminal equipment so ePrivacy Art 5(3) doesn't apply, and traffic data such as IP addresses is anonymized in order to satisfy ePrivacy Art 6(1). As far as GDPR is concerned, I rely on *legitimate interest* as a legal basis. I support opt out via the Do Not Track header.

My issue seems a little nuanced so a second opinion would be great - though it might require some familiarity with  web dev. soooo....\n\nI am building a web-app. Users keep their anonymity - though are assigned an ID on registration (simply a 'BEGIN' button). They are asked a series of questions as they progress through the app, similar to a survey, with feedback given after each set of questions. \n\nThe questions relate to user experiences, though no combination of data points can be used to re-identify them. Answers are stored and attributed to a user ID. This allows us to recall answers later and give feedback. It will also allow us to give the user a password so they can recall their session at a later date. \n\nWe maintain that this data does not pertain to a users actual identity and we *only retain data that is necessary for our app to work*. Some of the collected answers are used for research, which is stated clearly in our Privacy Notice. The 'research' part is simply some automated graphs etc showing aggregate trends across answers. \n\nReferencing cookie law, our cookie banner offers users a choice to \n\n\t*i) Persist their login details locally so they can quickly resume there session easily on this device*\n\n\t*ii) opt in to Google Analytics*\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. The data we need for the app to work (arguably 'strictly necessary') is also used for internal research/reporting - two purposes, though we are fully transparent with our intentions. We highlight this both on the registration page and in our Privacy Notice. Both purposes are essential for the app to run, and \"opt-out\" is not really possible in this case. Does GDPR prevent us from generating reports from the data we collect? What is the correct way for us to ask them to agree to this on registration?\n2. By default no data is stored on the users computer, though a user ID is generated on registration and subsequent answers are sent to our server. I would like to persist the ID in localstorage so that the users session can be recalled when they return. Do I need the user to opt in to do this (i.e an option to consent within our cookie banner - above)? Can an \"accept all\" option be used? it is unlikely they will opt in at all if they have to configure each cookie individually with our cookie manager. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.

By the same reasoning, a banner that says ‚Äúby continuing to use this site, you consent ‚Ä¶‚Äù is not valid and was never valid, contrary to old guidance from some authorities such as the French CNIL.\n\nThe ECJ explicitly noted in that case that it wasn't asked about whether consent in context of a raffle could be freely given, so it didn't weigh in on that.\n\nRegarding specificity of consent, the EDPB guidelines on consent 05/2020 do not cite any cases, and just refer to the GDPR itself which is already fairly clear in itself.",

This Jackal08 fellow seems to be taking your concerns seriously, which is good, and he's correct that the data in isolation can't identify an individual, but that's not necessarily how GDPR works.\n\nFirst and foremost, they need to look at the ePrivacy Directive. People call it the \"cookie law\" but the text covers reading any data from a device. A MAC address is not a cookie, but it's covered by ePD. \n\nFurthermore, the fact that data is identifying when combined with other data, would raise a flag to me that the data is actually personal data. Like, I can get my own MAC address and then email them and ask \"what data do you have about me?\" and it's technically feasible to answer that. In my opinion (and this is only an opinion), that's a significant step towards the data being personal data.\n\nThe linked GDPR notice is not a privacy policy. The linked privacy policy is not GDPR-compliant. A light skim indicates several critical components which are missing, most notably the legal bases of processing activities. Also \"industry standard for SaaS products\" is not necessarily compliant.",

The ICO website is the only website I know that does this well, since consent controls are always available in the lower left corner. Phones also make it easy to revoke device permissions from apps.

                "body": "The first question to answer is whether you need marketing consent for push notifications at all.  The ePrivacy Directive is the relevant EU law that imposes the consent requirement, but that law has no direct effect itself, and is instead implemented by member state law at the national level.  Consequently, while there is a degree of consistency across the EU, the law differs in each country.  Also keep in mind that in most cases the law probably won‚Äôt specifically address push notifications, and the question will largely depend on whether member state regulators (through guidance they publish) interpret the law as covering them.  In the U.K., for example, the regulator considers communications to fall within scope if they are stored and retrievable by the user at a later date‚Ä¶so an email would fall within scope but regular internet ads would not.\n\nIf you do get consent, it needs to be freely given, specific and given by a clear affirmative action, among other things.  I recommend reading the ico direct marketing [code of practice](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2021/2619043/direct-marketing-code-draft-guidance-122020.pdf) for a summary of what those requirements entail and what you need to do to obtain valid consent.

My question isn‚Äôt so much about the data collected, but more about the legal basis for the purpose of making an assessment of the support they require. The only viable option it seems for the special category data is explicit consent. None of the other 9 article 9 conditions would work. But in terms of the basic article 6 condition I am torn between ‚Äòlegitimate interests‚Äô or ‚Äòconsent‚Äô. Providing support of this kind is the very essence of why the charity exists which suggests legitimate interest. Question 1 - Consent wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be needed to make an assessment of their data would it? (Apart from explicit consent for the special category data)\n\nI see any processing after the assessment purpose as different purposes as they are too wide ranging to come under a ‚Äòsingle purpose of support‚Äô e.g counselling support, financial support, payment toward a holiday, help with housing, etc. Question 2 - Do you think this is the right way of looking at it? I.e looking at the subsequent support after the assessment as different discrete purposes which need their own legal basis?",

Or so we thought. \n\nWe all went through GDPR together and client confirmed that they had changed their process to gather informed consent for any subsequent contact that we made.\n\nI received a SAR last night specifically asking to provide the record of consent that we hold. We have never directly held the record of consent, instead making a series of monthly spot checks with the client where we take a sample from the data supplied and ask them to check and confirm they have a record of consent.\n\nIn light of the SAR I asked them to supply me with the actual record of consent instead of just confirming that they had it and the response I got, from our client, was :\n\n\"We have the following wording on our petitions that maybe they missed :\n\n'If you choose to leave your contat details we will use them to contact you for further campains and/or donations. You can opt out at any time.'\n\nI hope that helps\"\n\n_F**k_\n\nSo they have clearly not been correctly gathering informed opt-in and we've been calling people since 2017 under the assumption that they were compliant.

Of course, as you explain, that legitimate interest is rather slim since newer browser privacy features limit the performance benefits of using shared CDNs.\n\nBack when GDPR came into force I removed most CDNs from my website, and doing it for fonts was fairly simple: download the files from Google Fonts and upload it on your website, while making sure to comply with the font licenses. However, now the majority of bandwidth is used for font downloads.\n\n> The checkin box for the contact functionality is also in a grey zone, but probably isn't compliant.\n\nWhy? This would depend a lot on what consent is being asked.\n\n> As for recaptca, I don't see any reason to use it if you are a developer.\n\nI'm not sure I follow. Captchas definitely reduce spam, though the user experience is pretty horrible. The important point from the GDPR perspective is that the captcha must have a purpose, legal basis, and that the captcha is an appropriate means of achieving the purpose. Challenges are not DIY territory so it makes sense to use an existing service, though I might point out that there's more than one provider. E.g. [Cloudflare stopped using ReCaptcha](https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-from-recaptcha-to-hcaptcha/) a year ago.",

Now, article 7 - 1 states that I have to proof that the user gave his consent.  \n[https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-7-conditions-for-consent-GDPR.htm](https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-7-conditions-for-consent-GDPR.htm)\n\nI'm wondering, how and where do I do so? Is this something within the cookie plugin or is it within wordpress?\n\nI checked some cookie plugins but I was not able to (quickly) find, where I can find the proof.\n\nAm I getting this correctly? Do I need to check the cookie (and any other) consent plugins I use on a wordpress site on wether they safe the data anywhere? I figured there's most likely an entry in the database but that would be something I'd have to look up and find.",

                "body": "There are two lines of possible reasoning behind InMail:\n\n1. Necessity to perform contractual obligations. When you sign up for a LinkedIn account, you sign an agreement with LinkedIn, whereby you accept their ToU. Point 2.5 thereof says _Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages and InMails_. Obviously, this point cannot be fulfilled if LinkedIn had to restrict InMail. However, given the narrow interpretation of the concept of _necessity_, I am not completely sold on this reasoning.\n1. Legitimate interests. Even if a necessity-based legal basis would not hold, legitimate interests absolutely would. LinkedIn has an interest in facilitating InMail as part of its service (see above), especially in case of selling Premium memberships to cover the costs of functioning of the platform for everyone. Furthermore, even if you did not read ToU (to which you agreed anyway), you cannot reasonably say that you didn't expect that other people can contact you via LinkedIn (I mean, come on, it's a networking platform). As a _reasonable expectation_ of processing of data is a requirement for a successful legitimate interest-based processing, LinkedIn is certainly covered from this angle.\n\nWhat do you need to know for your platform? You don't need consent. Hell, imo you shouldn't ask for consent for Instant Messaging, as that would mean you'd need to create a function whereby people can withdraw their consent which would have to render them unreachable via IM. What you are better off in doing is to be able to claim legitimate interests. Mention the function in your Terms of Use, and make sure people are aware that it exists - legitimate interests cannot be claimed if data subjects would consider such data processing as _unexpected_.",

You're either processing personal data or not, it does not matter if you intended to do it or not. It only matters whether you fall under the scope or not.

These last few days though I am getting bombarded with emails telling me to implement consent mode.  I am chalking this up to someone or some department not thinking this all the way through when it was implemented.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nDoes anyone know how to check the current consent status on Shopify checkout pages that use Checkout Extensibility? Aside from reviewing the `dataLayer` or using the Consent Inspector (which doesn‚Äôt appear to work reliably on these pages), is there anything we can run in the browser Console to verify consent state?\n\nThe reason I‚Äôm asking is that we have two Google Ads Conversion Tracking setups: one implemented via GTM and the other through a Customer Events pixel. The pixel-based implementation is recording conversions accurately, but the GTM-based one is significantly underreporting. I suspect this may be due to the built-in consent checks in the Google Ads Conversion Tracking tag template--where it won't fire unless it has ad\\_storage | ad\\_personalization | ad\\_user\\_data consent as granter (or atleast that's my belief)\n\nFor context, the client is using OneTrust for consent management, but no custom consent update scripts are currently pushing consent state into the GTM `dataLayer`.\n\nLooking for your guidance!\n\nFor reference: i am using this script and aligning the variables using this:  \n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/12So6IxULwH0\\_wPhhL3bUqDc1DJPYwZx1twMWQqOqdQg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12So6IxULwH0_wPhhL3bUqDc1DJPYwZx1twMWQqOqdQg/edit?usp=sharing)  \n",

Since they have a global audience including EU, I have implemented a consent management platform (CookieBot) through Google Tag Manager. This seems to work in that all GA4 hits are fired in consent mode until the user provides consent. However, because all hits before consent approval are fired in consent mode, we end up without a starting page\\_view event on the original landing page, which can screw with source attribution if there's UTM tags etc present.\n\nSo I guess the question I have, is whether it is a good idea to re-fire the GA4 pageview tag through GTM after consent is granted? Or does the gtag consent update call already make sure that previous hits in the same session are re-processed without consent mode?\n\nThe complication I have, is that GA4 is installed on-page using gtag.js, whereas the CMP is installed through Google Tag Manager. So just blanket firing the pageview tag on the cookie\\_consent\\_update datalayer event will result in duplicates in cases where people have already provided consent.\n\nWhat would be a good solution here?",

You say \"GA4 hits are fired in consent mode\", so I'm assuming there's a GA4 page\\_view hit with the gcs parameter = G100\n\nYou 100% do not need to retrigger a page\\_view after the user grants consent as long as there is a proper update of Google Consent Mode state to \"granted\"\n\nYou *should* see perhaps a user\\_engagement event at the moment when the user navigates to a new page. That user\\_engagement event should have a gcs parameter = G111 (assuming the user granted full consent).\n\nGA4 backtracks from there to understand \"hey, this user consented. That previous page\\_view event is therefore consented\"\n\nEDIT: Have a look at the GA4 network events when you land and grant consent on [https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/](https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/)\n\nTheir site is a good example of a \"proper\" flow of GA4 events in a Google Consent Mode environment.\n\nBonus: They also use CookieBot.\n\nThis was the first ever consent management project I completed for a client.",

You will also have to configure your tags to trigger unconditionally for these regions as well.\n\n\nThis option is technically possible but legally a gray area. I know for a fact that many regions outside the EU also require some sort of consent.\n\n\n\n\n>¬† Set default to be 'Granted' everywhere, and let EEA users choose correct consent (this is risky option?)\n\n\nThis is called opt-out tracking and is areal gray area. Any company I've worked with has deemed it not legal in the EU as (without additional configuration) you would still be tracking a user on the first page load even if the user ultimately decides to not give consent.",

I'm noob in Google Tag Manager and Analytics, but quite skilled at coding, so I want to implement this myself.\n\nMy banner has \"functional\" (cannot be turned off), \"analytical\", and \"marketing\" categories. I'm gonna focus solely on analytics first. I'm storing user's decision in cookies locally in user's browser.\n\nNow I've tried all options I could find to do it with Consent Mode v2 but I couldn't get it working properly and I'm begging for help. \n\nMy goal: to add Google Analytics when analytical cookies are \"granted\" (should be simple).\n\nWhat I've done:\n\n1. Google Tag Manager -> Tags -> New -> Tag Configuration -> Google Analytics -> Choose Google Tag\n2. Went to its Advanced Settings -> Consent Settings -> Require additional consent to fire -> wrote \"analytics\\_storage\"\n3. I found [this documentation](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/guides/consent?consentmode=basic) form Google and tried both, \"basic mode\" and \"advanced mode\". \n   1. With basic, I only loaded the script with the default consents set to denied for all categories, and then, based on choices, I updated consent and added the google tag script. In Preview, this correctly loaded the default consent first before Google Tag (the one I added in Tag Manager) fired, which was good, but then I see \"update\" consent event fired correctly with updated values, but GA4 is not loaded afterwards (so consent \"update\" is the last event in Preview).\n   2. With advanced, I tried to make my own template. This was quite painful but good part was that I got the default consents set at Consent Initialization, before Google Tag was fired. Then, when I did update using the choices, the Google Tag was not re-fired.\n\n\n\nIt's actually a quite painful process to set these things up, I was thinking I finally got it and then I failed again. I'd be very thankful for any kind of help, thank you!! :)\n\nIf I could choose, I'd like to avoid making and using the template (so the advanced mode).",

Cookiebot is a popular choice, but any one will do the job.\n\nSecondly, tags don't re-fire when consent is granted and you shouldn't try to make them. If you're using advanced consent mode, just add regular triggers to the google tags (e.g All pages) and no additional consent checks (google tags have built in consent checks). They will fire without waiting for consent and what that does is better explained in the documentation for advanced consent mode.\n\nFor basic consent mode (and for non-google tags), you add additional consent checks AND use the CMP's datalayer event for consent update, usually something like cookie\\_consent\\_update (refer to their docs). No All pages triggers here, just the datalayer event (+additional rules in the trigger depending on the case). This will prevent the tags from firing until consent is given, and will fire them if consent is granted.",

In a ideal world everything that was blocked before now fires, i am not able to come up with a efficient solution. \\[Mainly because the accept all cookies event occurs BEFORE the consent update event\\]\n\n\\- LOSS: Metadata, source, referall, UTM tags, Marketing tags etc.\n\nWhat are the most efficient ways you guys have deployed to trigger/fire the blocked cookies once the user clicks \"accept all cookies\".  The OneTrust support team main solution seems to be that you create specific triggers for your C0002, C0003, C0004, C0005. \\[This does not seem very optimal and requires maintenance\\]\n\nAlso have you guys had issues with the Autoblocker?

                "body": "Onetrust documentation used to be worse, but I am surprised they are still recommending adding C0003, C0004 etc checks into the firing triggers. You're right, it's absolutely not the best way.\n\nIf you want to use \"old school\" (non Google Consent Mode) consent control in GTM, the absolute best way to do this is by creating a Custom Event trigger with a regex match against \".\\*\" (i.e., all events) and a condition that looks for the presence of e.g. C0004 and if it's not there, the trigger will fire. Use this as an exception trigger added to every tag that requires C0004 consent.\n\nThere's a community gallery custom variable by \"taneli-salonen1\" that is possibly the best way to retrieve the C000X values because it looks at both the data layer and the relevant cookie. Super reliable.\n\nThus adding consent requirements to a tag is just adding the relevant exception trigger. Even works for tags that need both analytics and marketing consent, just add both exception triggers.\n\n  \nWhere you have existing tags firing on All Pages, DOM Ready, Initialization etc., you will have to move those to a Custom Event trigger of OneTrustGroupsUpdated. Doing this is a matter of editing the trigger, clicking on the trigger type and changing it to Custom Event. This way you keep any existing additional trigger conditions. Saves you having to create a new trigger and manually recreating the conditions, which is long-winded and prone to error.\n\nAll that being said, it's *so* much easier to implement Google Consent Mode!",

                "body": "Several things here do not make sense.\n\n\n\"the accept all cookies event occurs BEFORE the consent update event\" - Correct, the visitor must make the choice to accept or reject before that update is ran. How could you know what to update before the choosing?\n\n\n\"firing in the US\" and \"everything that was blocked before now fires\" - Why is your initial state blocked? That is EU / GDPR - not US. US is opted in (not blocked) until explicitly opted out.¬†\n\n\n\"OneTrust support team main solution seems to be that you create specific triggers\" - This has not been the correct/ modern way to configure OneTrust since October 2023. Use the GCM integration technique that OneTrust publishes on their web site. Following the instructions for using the tag template integrated with Google Consent Mode. On the individual tags set the consent settings. All CMPs (CookieYes, CookieBot, CookieHub, etc) work nearly identical to this.\n\n\n\"issues with the Autoblocker\" - The technique that OneTrust details on their web site does not employ the obsolete autoblocker.\n\n\n\"trigger/fire the blocked cookies\" - You do not trigger the cookies. You trigger the JavaScript tags. The cookies are just small tools that the tags use to 'remember' things - like PostIt notes. The tags are 'the thing'. All modern Consent Management Platforms (CMPs - the C stands for Consent not Cookie) including OneTrust control the firing of JavaScript tags and also the older image pixel tag technique.\n\n\n\"UTM tags\" - UTMs are not tags. UTMs are initial site landing URL query string parameters. Specifically URL query string parameters that trace their use back decades to the Urchin Tracking Module web analytics product offering.\n\nhttps://my.onetrust.com/s/article/UUID-d81787f6-685c-2262-36c3-5f1f3369e2a7?language=en_US",

That used to be the workaround for how to track users on the landing page when they granted consent.\n\nI haven't checked, but if your marketing and analytics data collection is all handled within GTM, you could solve your problems quickly by removing the plugin currently providing that cookie banner and instead implementing e.g. CookieBot, OneTrust, Enzuzo or CookieYes via their officially supported GTM tag template.\n\nAll 4 will set up the Consent Mode default and will handle the update.

Here's the situation.\n\nWe have a WooCommerce website in the US that does not have any form of cookie consent banner implemented. There's a very barebones GTM setup, too. We've had GA4 loaded by GTM for a couple of years now, and no signs of problems that we've noticed. We recently started our first banner ad campaign and need to deploy 3 tracking tags: A site-wide retargeting tag, an add-to-cart retargeting tag, and a conversion tag on the order confirmation page. Since this is a WooCommerce site, I set up GTM4WP, which created all the necessary data layers and events. \n\nWe used the GTM preview mode, which shows all the various tags firing at the right time, picking up the right values from the datalayer and passing them into the tag variables. All looks good, but the ad agency says they're not seeing anything coming through for conversions. They said they have \"been seeing a lot of issues with google tag manager and the changes related to consent mode, and this is not just for XXXXXX but even for Google Ads.\" And then they suggested hand-coding the conversion tracking tag on the order confirmation page. This sounded like BS to me, but at the same time, I've not been keeping up with consent mode like I should have been. \n\nSo, is this plausible? There have been zero changes in our GTM container related to consent. I heard that retargeting for Google Ads would need additional set up, but we're not running Google Ads at the moment. The tags in question are clearly firing, and if there was a problem with consent mode, wouldn't that be preventing the tags from firing at all? The fact that the tags are firing means, to me at least, that is the same result as if we'd hand-coded the tag to the confirmation page; in both cases, the script for the tracking pixel loads. Am I missing something?\n\nthanks!",

You can't set it up and use it in the same way, it has no integration in any of the popular consent platforms (OneTrust, CookieBot, CookieYes etc) and, worse still, their \"denied\" setting doesn't prevent the Microsoft Universal Event Tracking tag from dropping a pair of cookies. There's also of course no native integration with GTM.\n\nI've tested a few iterations of a possible best practise GTM implementation and I think I have a potential winner.\n\nEDIT: Step zero: Add the hardcoded script to your site (prior to the GTM script) :\n\n    <script>\n    window.uetq = window.uetq || [];\n    window.uetq.push('consent', 'default', {\n        'ad_storage': 'denied'\n        });\n    </script>\n\n1. Configure your Microsoft UET config tag to require ad\\_storage as additional consent (not strictly necessary, but makes your Consent Overview report make sense\n2. Remove all triggers from the tag\n3. Set \"Once per page\" in Tag firing options\n4. Create a new custom HTML tag with the following script at the bottom of this list\n5. Set tag sequencing to fire your Microsoft UET config tag after the custom HTML tag\n6. Set \"Don't fire if \\[this custom HTML tag\\] fails or is paused\" (may not be needed?)\n7. Add `ad_storage` as additional consent\n8. Add your consent platform's data layer event e.g. `OneTrustGroupsUpdated`, `cookie_consent_update` etc.\n\n&#8203;\n\n     <script>\n        window.uetq = window.uetq || [];\n        window.uetq.push('consent', 'default', {\n            'ad_storage': 'granted'\n            });\n      </script>\n    \n    Links:\n\nMicrosoft Consent Mode: [https://help.ads.microsoft.com/apex/index/3/en/60119](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/apex/index/3/en/60119)\n\nMicrosoft enforcing their own CoMo for Microsoft Ads: [https://web.swipeinsight.app/posts/microsoft-ads-enforces-consent-mode-for-tracking-in-europe-8734](https://web.swipeinsight.app/posts/microsoft-ads-enforces-consent-mode-for-tracking-in-europe-8734)\n\n**Notes:**\n\nDuring testing I did see that the network hits being sent by the UET config tag would redact visitor and session ID if the tag fired with Microsoft CoMo set to denied, but as the tag still dropped a couple of cookies I didn't want to implement it in that way and call it good. Hopefully Microsoft amend this and we can have a much simpler solution in future.",

Is it a GDPR concern *\\[my note: this should be ePrivacy\\]*, since they are being set before the user has granted consent?\n\nTheir frankly unbelievable response was...\n\n>Neither MSPTC nor MUID should be set before consent is granted. We should not set any cookies (3P and 1P) without consent and MSPTC & MUID are 3P [bing.com](http://bing.com) cookies. If they already exist, they may be sent and show up in a network trace, but we will throw them away (not store when we receive) if ad storage consent is denied. They may be used for anti-spam/fraud purposes only.\n\n\"Neither MSPTC nor MUID should be set...\" and yet they are and it's Microsoft's own UET tag (or dependant script, more likely) doing the setting.\n\nThey also acknowledge that the tag doesn't re-fire / issue another network hit once consent is updated. Their answer is \"this will be addressed in a future update\"\n\nSo, in summary Microsoft are telling us :-\n\n1. You must implement Microsoft Consent Mode otherwise (in affected jurisdictions) you will lose the ability to use marketing data to its full extent, just like Google did to comply with the DMA on March 6th 2024.\n2. We half-assed the logic underpinning our implementation of our own Consent Mode, despite that it's been available for many months. It doesn't work as it's supposed to and if you implement it in the manner we intend, you are going to cause cookies to be set prior to user consent.\n3. If you implement it in the way we intend, it's going to screw with your data because not only did we half-ass the logic, we half-assed the code.",

When I visit my website for the first time, no cookies are set. If I select \"accept all\" in the cookie banner, some cookies are set, which are automatically deleted when I withdraw consent. However, one cookie is not deleted and remains stored. The cookie starts with *ga* and has the target ID of the Analytics account attached.

The law requires that tools no longer use them, so that means that as long as your Google analytics returns to denied and is no longer triggered, it's OK. On the other hand, the advanced consent mode v2 (hit denied and triggered even when no consent is given) is legally \"restricted\" to date because the legislative organisms have said nothing about it. But consent mode v2 standard is rgpd friendly.\nLet's put that aside: Cookiebot does have the ability to delete cookies, it's pretty top-notch in this respect, and it's one of the only ones to do so (which proves that if the others don't do it, it's because it's not compulsory).\n As far as the ga cookie not being deleted is concerned, it's probably only because cookiebot can't delete it if you're connected to a Google account on your browser (especially if it's Google Chrome with the Google account linked to the browser). A ga cookie remains persistent on all the sites you visit. Try using private browsing, it should no longer be there ;)\nMore info :\nhttps://complianz.io/withdrawing-consent/",

I've never considered auto-blocking as a good solution because I don't know how it works. If I don't know how it works, I can't be sure it is 100% effective. Auto-blocking also usually blocks the entirety of GTM from loading, so if you have tags in GTM that you need to fire and those tags don't need consent... they now won't be firing. Someone here was describing their GTM pushes a lot of metadata via Custom HTML tags, so that could be really messy for them.\n\nWithout auto-blocking, you need to follow CookieBot's documentation on how to manage consent. As we're in the GTM subreddit, I won't talk about how to manage consent for scripts that are hardcoded on site.\n\nIn GTM, where you have tags firing on All Pages (or variations of), you will need to switch that to a Custom Event \"cookie\\_consent\\_update\", which is a data layer event emitted by CookieBot both when a user makes a change to their consent and on subsequent page loads when CookieBot's script has run and found the user has already made a consent choice.\n\nIn order for tags to not fire when there's no consent, you figure out how to put together an exception trigger that fires when the specific consent is missing / denied (CookieBot docs detail this).\n\nBut...\n\nThen Google Consent Mode comes along and changes the process. Instead you *can* have All Pages triggers, but only for Google native tags (GA4 Event, gAds etc) and instead of using exception triggers, you have \"Additional Consent\" within each tag's advanced settings. 3rd-party tags (Facebook, Hotjar etc). Still need to look for cookie\\_consent\\_update, but they can also do away with exception triggers and instead use the Additional Consent settings.\n\nIf you're implementing Google Consent Mode (it's CoMo for short), you can do this via tags in GTM, but it's arguably better to not do that. Hardcode a CoMo \"default\" script immediately prior to your GTM script and CookieBot will take care of sending the CoMo \"update\".",

That was all I needed to know to decide to not use it, because you have to keep WordPress up to date if you don't want the risk of security problems.\n\nGTM Kit appears to be exactly the correct thing to use (I'm sure there are others, but this one works). I even sent a couple Github issue reports to the dev and they resolved those issues quickly, including updating for CoMo V2.\n\nGTM Kit will insert your GTM container and set up CoMo, but you still need to integrate a consent management platform. I did that by using the built-in \"theme file editor\" tool in WP admin. I added a function in \"functions.php\" that inserted the code for the consent platform. In my case that was OneTrust, but it would be the same process for any other.\n\nThat made sure the scripts were all in the correct order, nice and high up in the <head> section.\n\nEven so... looks like you have some work ahead to actually apply consent handling to the scripts or tags responsible for data collection, because they are greedliy collecting data even after opt-out.",

Since Consent Mode and GDPR are tied together and it is quite a bit European topic, I assume you are targeting a European country, but this is just a guess. If not, below might make no sense at all. \n\nSorry for the long post, I wanted to be thorough. I know your question is more about the actual implementation then the GDPR side of things, but if you are still in the implementation phase, this could be something to take into account. Basic mode is easier to implement and to 'understand' than advanced and the latter also comes with quite some questions revolving GDPR.\n\n# About Advanced Consent mode and personal data\n\nI just wanted to add that advanced consent mode comes with a bit of moral issue where even the cookieless pings can hold personal data, which you will not see, but you 'expect' google to not do anything with it. \n\n**Preemtive Loading**\n\nThere is also the issue with Preemtive Loading: Google Tags load before the consent banner appears, improving data capture potential. This means you can potentially collect some data even before users make a decision about consent.\n\nBut the whole idea about granting consent is that you as a user should be able to make the decision yourself if your data can be collected and shared (with Google).   \nSo basically, collecting (personal) data **before** the user actually made a decision on consent is not what granting consent should be about.   \nNaturally, for marketeers and business owner this is quite valuable, but the question is if this is moral. Especially since those cookieless pings hold personal data that Google still collecs on their American servers, which by default is not legal as long as the (European) user did not agree with collecting data. \n\n**Collected personal data**\n\nSee this thread where commenters explained it as well: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/1deu4va/is\\_advanced\\_consent\\_mode\\_gdpr\\_compliant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/1deu4va/is_advanced_consent_mode_gdpr_compliant/)\n\n*A quote from that thread:* \n\n>Data is still being sent with consent mode enabled, and this data includes personal data that can be used to fingerprint an individual such as **IP** and **user agent**.\n\n>Whenever a request is made on the Internet, these two are always included, so there is no way around it.\n\n>With consent mode enabled you are still sending requests containing the personal data of the user, the only difference is that you trust Google not to do anything sketchy with this data.\n\nSecond, this website gives a nice list of what is all collected with cookieless pings: [https://cookie-script.com/blog/basic-advanced-google-consent-mode-v2](https://cookie-script.com/blog/basic-advanced-google-consent-mode-v2)\n\n\"Pings only contain non-identifiable and/or aggregate information about user interactions, such as: \n\n* **Location** (country)\n* **Timestamp**\n* **Browser type**\n* **Device type**\n* Referrer website or page\n* Indications of ad-clicks\n* Conversion type.\"\n\nTogether with that previous mentioned comment about the IP address, I think it is very sketchy.   \n  \nSo yes, all seperate, they do not tell that much, but mixed together, the actual time + ip + country + browser+ device combination could be thrown together to still create some sort of audience.",

For example, make advanced consent mode only work in Non-European countries.   \nNow, no organisation or country has said that advanced consent mode is wrong and should be illegal in Europe, but there are talks about it. So be aware, that even advanced consent mode might not be sufficient for European users. \n\nOf course, this whole rant about GDPR things can be ignored and just collect whatever you can within the grey area of advanced consent mode, but be aware that if you want to 'be the best in class', advanced consent mode can have too many moral issues that you cannot ignore. I work at a data consultancy company and almost all of our (European) clients did not implement Advanced for these reasons. \n\nAgain, sorry for the long post but it was quite fun to find articles about it and I hope it helps. At least it helped me to stay a bit up to date. Naturally, if someone disagrees please let me know. I might have it wrong of course.",

        "author": "trucker-123",

        "selftext": "Hi.  I am using the Cookie Script consent banner (Cookie Script is a certified Google Ads CMP partner) only in the UK and EU for my website.  This means that for countries outside the UK and EU, the Cookie Script consent banner is not being shown on my website. I installed the Cookie Script consent banners with a tag in GTM (Google Tag Manager).\n\nNow the problem is, in Google Ads, the conversion count column on the Campaign Report is not counting some conversions for customers outside the UK and EU.  In fact, I did a test and I clicked on my own ad in Google outside the UK/EU (so I was not given the consent banner), registered on my own website, and I was not counted as a conversion in Google Ads.\n\nI asked Cookie Script support about this and they recommended in GTM, that I set \"Default Consent (Global)\" for my Cookie Script consent banners settings to \"Granted\", and then under \"Default Consent (Region-specific),\" I should add UK and add each country in the EU and set them to \"Denied.\"  \n\nI took a screenshot of Cookie Script support's answer, gave it to Google Ads customer support, and then asked Google Ads customer support if I could do this, and they said no, I can't do it, because setting \"Default Consent (Global)\" for my Cookie Script consent banners settings to \"Granted\" could violate customer privacy outside the UK and EU.  I then asked Google Ads support again if setting \"Default Consent (Global)\" being set to \"Denied\" in GTM is causing some of my customers to not being counted as conversions in Google Ads outside the UK and EU, but they repeated the same customer privacy issue and wouldn't answer my question.\n\nSo given that my consent banner only appears for customers inside the UK and EU, but the consent banner won't appear for customers outside the UK and EU, I have a few questions:\n\n1) Does anybody know if \"Default Consent (Global)\" being set to \"Denied\" would cause conversions to not be counted for customers outside the UK and EU, if my consent banner isn't shown to customers outside the UK and EU? (this is the question that Google Ads customer support refuses to answer directly)\n\n2) Is there a way in GTM where I can have the Cookie Script consent banner tag suppressed outside the UK and EU, so that the issue of consent isn't even on the table outside the UK and EU (would this make it legal outside the UK/EU if consent isn't even on the table like the old days?), and would this work with Google Ads conversion counting?  Before the Cookie Script consent banner and before I transitioned to GTM, I was just using the old Google Ads conversion tag script and conversion counting was working fine in Google Ads - I assume with the old Google Ads conversion tag script, the issue of consent isn't even on the table for outside the UK and EU, so I assume nothing is even violated?",

Without a cookie banner or other consent mechanism, it's odd that the consent would change.\n\nIf you click on the 'container loaded' and 'DOM Ready' events in Tag Assistant, is your consent set to 'Denied' at those stages? If it's granted, this might not be affecting your tracking. Make sure you're clearing your cookies if you've already accepted tracking on the EU version of the site.\n\nNow, I obviously can't tell you this for certain, but it's very unlikely that Google would take action against your account for consent related stuff outside the European Economic Area, which is where they're mostly worried about. And they would most likely warn you before banning you. \n\nI've seen Google Ads threaten accounts in the past for accidentally collecting email addresses in URLs, and they gave the client a couple of months to fix it before they would disable the account. \n\nThat being said, if you were to implement the cookie banner for other regions, you could set it to opt-out rather than opt-in and you'd be fine under the majority of global privacy laws (disclaimer: this is not legal advice). Many users just ignore it completely, so it won't affect your tracking nearly as much as an opt-in banner.\n\nGoogle Support just can't risk recommending something that might violate some country's law, and it's pretty much impossible to know all of them.",

Just check to see if there are values in the Consent tab. \n\nTo your second question, it's theoretically possible but difficult (GTM doesn't inherently know where users are and consent values load before anything else) and I don't think there would be a legal difference between defaulting to granted vs not sending any consent values at all (though I'm not a lawyer).\n\nI'm guessing Google doesn't want to tell you to default to granted while not showing a banner because it would technically violate some privacy laws like CCPA (which requires a way for users to opt out). But whether cookies are granted in GTM just affects tag functionality; you're not using those values as a consent log or anything like that. \n\nI would go with Cookie Script's recommendation, and also consider showing the banner with opt-out defaults in other regions to make sure that you're generally compliant with other privacy laws.",

        "selftext": "Our e-commerce store has a hybrid SPA setup.  True page reloads happen at least when a user visits the website and on the thank you page when a purchase is made. We have advanced consent mode implemented and I‚Äôm trying to fix the page_view event for non-Google platforms when a user has not interacted with the cookie banner yet.\n\nIf a user has never been on our webshop then a cookie banner is shown and, since ads cookies aren‚Äôt accepted yet, the facebook pageview for example is blocked. If a user then accepts all cookies we would miss out on the first page view. So, I added the cookieScriptUpdate as a trigger too. Now, the users page view event would initially be blocked as it should. Then, after accepting cookies, it would fire the page view event. But this leads to a new problem, if a user had already consented, a page load would result in our custom page view and the cookieScriptUpdate event to fire a page view event, resulting in 2 page views being sent.\n\nI can fix a workaround with custom HTML and CJS triggers and variables but was wondering if someone has a ‚Äòcleaner‚Äô solution.\n\nExample 1:\nUser visits first time > \npage_visit is blocked because no consent is given > \nuser accepts cookie > \npage view is fired with cookieScriptUpdate event\n\nExample 2:\nUser visits and consent is accepted in a previous session > \npage view fires on page_vist > \npage view fires again on cookieScriptUpdate\n\nAlways triggering it on the update statement isn‚Äôt possible since it would only show once at multiple pages due to the SPA setup.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I have no tags that fire before this. So I don't know how a tag could read consent state before a default was set when there are no tags firing before a default or an update was set. \n\nWhen I test a purchase conversion, my GAds tag says \"Still Running\" and I am 99% sure it is because it is a consent mode error \"A tag read consent state before a default was set\".

I am finding out that this doesn't work well, because many conversions outside the UK and EU are not being counted in Google Ads (the technical reason is because \"Default Consent (Global)\" being set to \"Denied\" for my Cookie Script GTM tag settings and Google Ads support says it must be set to \"Denied\" after I talked with them).\n\nMy original plan was to only show the consent banner in the UK and EU (and/or other regions where it's mandatory).  But because some conversions outside the UK and EU are not being counted in Google Ads, the only way to address this situation is to show the Cookie Script consent banner to all my customers around the world, and the consent banner also probably needs to cover most of the landing page, to force an \"Accept\" all cookies or \"Reject\" from the customer (hopefully I can get most customers to \"Accept\" the cookies).\n\nNow my questions is, after you put up a consent banner that took up most of the landing page to force an \"Accept\" all cookies or \"Reject\" it from the customers, how was your bounce rate on your landing page? Did the bounce rate on your landing page increase significantly after you put up a consent banner ? Or did the bounce rate only increase slightly and the consent banner didn't stop many customers from browsing your website?",

        "id": "184dbcq",
        "selftext": "Hi folks, I've been trying to implement consent mode with OneTrust & GTM, but running into a few issues.\n\n**My setup is as follows**:\n\n1. Tags set up in GTM (UA, GA4, Google Ads, Bing, Meta)\n2. Triggers set up via page view URL on all relevant tags. conversion actions etc\n3. Consent mode enabled in GTM and tags configured with 'no additional consent required'\n4. Consent mode enabled in OneTrust & Auto blocking turned off.\n5. OneTrust script is hardcoded to the site rather than being set up in GTM, and the OneTrust script is the first one that loads up on my site. We are not using a CMP Template.\n\nFurther info:\n\n**I've added this script before GTM code on my site head:**\n\n    <script>\n  // Define dataLayer and the gtag function.\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\n  // Default ad_storage to 'denied'.\n  gtag('consent', 'default', {\n    'ad_storage': 'denied'\n  });\n</script>\n\n**And added this to the body:** \n\n    <script>\n  function consentGranted() {\n    gtag('consent', 'update', {\n      'ad_storage': 'granted'\n    });\n  }\n</script>\n\n**Further Info**\n\nIn preview mode, I can see my GTM tags fire, but in the consent section in GTM preview. Ad\\_storage is set to denied as expected for default.\n\nOnce I click on 'accept all' on my site's cookie banner, the 'ad\\_storage' is still denied, meaning the user consent is not updating on GTM.\n\nOn the network tab in chrome, I can see GSC: 100, no matter if consent is given or not, this does not change to GCS: 111 which would show 'consent granted'\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? How do I get this to work properly?\n\nThe odd thing is, even though GTM says consent denied, after accepting cookies, I can see a pageview on UA, meaning that the cookie banner is working as it should, but why is it the case that GTM say's its not granted?\n\nBased on what I'm seeing in GTM, would this mean that no conversions would this mean that no conversions would be reported in Google Ads? And is it true that If you don't see any GCS parameter in the network console, this means that consent mode is not configured? The fact that I can see parameters means consent mode is working somewhat?\n\nThe reason I ask this is we had OneTrust set up before using GTM tags, as we had old gtags on our site and although conversions were still being reported in GA4 & UA, we had 0 conversions coming through in Google ads as consent was not configured at the time. Based on this current set up, if all traffic is being set to denied, would Google ads just only show modelled conversions?\n\nWhat would be the cause of the issues we're seeing? What is the perfect way to set up consent mode?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any feedback on this matter. \n\nThanks!",

                "body": "This is my area of expertise. It‚Äôs early and I haven‚Äôt had any coffee, but at first glance this sounds like Consent Mode has not been switched on inside OneTrust. Or, if it has been switched on then the OneTrust config needs to be published to make the change live.\n\nI‚Äôll read your post a bit more carefully after I‚Äôm properly awake.\n\nProperly awake edit:\n\nYou say you have CoMo switched on in OneTrust, but can you confirm you've re-published the OneTrust script afterward? This is exactly what a client of mine recently forgot to do and ended up with exactly what you're seeing.\n\nIt might not be 100% criticial, but I would ensure your scripts are in this order:-\n\n1. The Consent Mode \"default\" script. *Please also add* `wait_for_update: 500` *as the final line in that script.*\n2. Any existing data layer pushes for e.g. global variables (you might not have this at all, it's not required)\n3. GTM\n4. OneTrust\n\nI'm more inclined to rely on GTM being able to pick up all of the events OneTrust pushes to the data layer if GTM loads before OneTrust does.\n\nGoogle native tags firing prior to consent / with consent denied is entirely normal with Google Consent Mode. Once it's working and you see the 'update' that sets gcs=G111, look in the network tab and you'll see UA and GA4 both re-sending the previous hit (where gcs was G100) with some subtle indicators to the platform about why the hit was sent i.e. it's not a duplicatation.\n\nYour non-Google tags should not be firing from a standard Initialization, All Pages, DOM Ready or Window Loaded. Facebook, Hotjar, TikTok etc should all move to firing on the OneTrustGroupsUpdated trigger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven **more** awake edit:\n\nI'd missed the part where you added a CoMo update script to the <body>. You should remove that. OneTrust will take care of issuing the correct CoMo update command.\n\nEven with everything else  working as expected, by pushing ad\\_storage: \"granted\" in the update, you would defaulting all users to gcs=G110 without their consent, which is also not enough consent for UA or GA4 to fire (both ad\\_storage and analytics\\_storage must be granted).\n\nYou'll also be interfering with OneTrust's own issuance of the update command, which it does immediately prior to pushing OneTrustGroupsUpdated to the data layer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA mostly good example of a working implementation: https://www.magnet.co.uk/",

This is a good thing, because it neatly abstracts away just about 99% of what your CMP (Consent Management Platform) is doing... i.e. the service that provides the cookie banner.\n\nFor any and all of your Google platform tags, you don't have to worry about what fires when. Fire your page\\_view GA4 events on a Page View trigger and the Google Tag for your GA4 on Initialization (yes, separate the page\\_view event to its own tag and block the Google Tag from sending a page view!).\n\nIt's the non-Google tags that need a bit of special handling, because unless there is a data layer event like `shop_consent_updated` on every page, your life is difficult. If you don't have any non-Google tags (Facebook, Instagram, X, TikTok etc), you don't need to worry about this.\n\nHave a look at the list of events that happen on the *second* page after you grant consent. Are there any data layer events *after* the *second* `Consent` event? Also, check that there is in fact a second `Consent` event. The first should be the 'default' and the second should be 'update'. If you don't see that, you now have enough problems that you should completely ditch the current CMP and replace it with something like CookieBot, CookieYes or OneTrust / CookiePro. All three of those will give you a solid platform to build upon.\n\nIf you do find an event that reliably fires on every page and the event is always after the second `Consent`, *hopefully* it's an event emitted by the CMP and you can use that in your triggers for non-Google tags, although it would still need some regex trickery\n\nFor example, if the event that happens on every page after the Consent event is `cookies`, your trigger would be a Custom Event regex match `^(shop_consent_update|cookies)$`\n\nIf you are able to show screenshots (or by all means DM me some), I'd be happy to get into some more detail.\n\nUltimately, the last step(s) are go into your GTM container settings and activate \"Show Consent Overview Report\" (may not be the exact wording!) and then go into the container, then tags, then click the shield icon top-right. From there you can define which consent(s) each tag requires.\n\nad\\_storage = Marketing consent\n\nanalytics\\_storage = Analytics consent.\n\nGenerally you only need to worry about those two.",

Ie if 'cookieyes-consent' cookie contains 'analytics:yes' then analytics is granted.

I am finding a problem though in a few places and will use the below example to describe it.\n\nI have a third-party tag called 'Example' with additional consent checks for 'analytics\\_storage' setup.  That tag is of type custom html and loads a js script.  At the end of that script I have 'dataLayer.push({'event':'ExampleLoaded'});' to push a DL event so I know it is loaded.\n\nA second tag, 'Example2' of type custom html, loads another script and fires on event 'ExampleLoaded'.  When this tag fires I get 'A tag read consent state before a default was set' showing in Tag Assistant under 'Consent Configuration Status'.  Now, I do not have additional consent settings set for this tag so it fires fine, BUT when I set it for 'analytics\\_storage' required the tag does not fire and is blocked due to consent status.\n\nHow can that be?  It only fires AFTER the first tag loads, which also requires 'analytics\\_storage' and that first tag does not give me this error about reading consent state before a default was set.\n\nBefore someone tells me to remove additional consent for the second tag because it is not needed (it only fires after the first tag was loaded and that tag requires consent) keep in mind this was the most basic example I could give.

        "selftext": "After multiple implementations of Consent Mode v2 via GTM (and having tried multiple different CMPs), I'm finding that it's quite a pain in the ass to work with SPAs (Single Page Apps).\n\nThe CMPs often don't send any data layer push when user chooses to change their consent after initially having accepted (e.g. for only a specific cookie category, not all), making it really difficult to update the consent in real time using GTM, and what's worse, potentially leading to non-compliance. \n\nOr, other CMPs don't work with SPAs in a sense that the Privacy trigger (the button with which user can change preferences that's meant to be visible at all times) disappears when navigating to a different page (again, hello non-compliance). And I'm not talking any CMPs here... but the big names like CookieBot or CookieScript.\n\nI have a skilled developer friend who has built his own cookie tool that can communicate the consent signals to Google on a regular website as well as SPAs and we're playing with an idea to build a simple CMP that would be easy to work with using GTM (would provide all the necessary data layer pushes, etc.) and would support not only regular pages, but also SPAs.\n\nWould there be anyone interested in helping us beta test when ready and potentially having a say in the tool's features?

Problem is, that 'once' counts even if the the tag didn't fire due to exceptions, consent checks, etc.\n\nI've recently implemented consent mode with a cmp and realizing how beneficial, easier, etc things would be if there was a 'once successfully per page' option for tags.  In other words, that one time would only count if the tag successfully fired including exceptions/consent/etc.\n\nExample, tag is setup to fire once per page and has triggers of all pages and consent\\_update with ad\\_storage required as additional consent.  Page loads, ad\\_storage is not granted, and the tag tries to fire, but fails due to consent not given.  A few seconds later, consent\\_update happens and consent IS now given... the tag does not fire because of the previous failed attempt.\n\nNow, if there was another option like 'once successfully per page', it would try firing again and this time do so successfully... all future attempts on the page would not fire because it already successfully has.\n\nI'm sure someone will say 'use once per event' and do this or that, but it is just not the same behavior that is wanted / expected in this case.  It literally says 'tag firing option' and lets you choose 'once per page'... I think most people would expect that to mean it actually fires once per page... not attempts to do so.\n\nPart of this post is a rant because it would make gtm, consent, and possibly other situations work sooooo much nicer and the other is some weird hope that someone at Google/GTM actually sees this and considers this in a future update.\n\nI've come across many others posting the same 'issue' across the web so if you feel the same please upvote and maybe someone will take notice and do something about this in a future gtm update.",

The trigger was a \"consent updated\" event that was being added to the dataLayer from the CMP (OneTrust). Was blaming OneTrust originally, because an implementation I did with cookiebot was working, but then I noticed the \"once per page\" setting was on for the tag.\n\nDid you manage to find an acceptable solution? Because at the moment my solution is to turn off the once per page event and be damned for any extra hits that occur. Don't know why the tag was set to fire only once, might need to put a workaround in place within the script itself - it's a custom html tag that is setting up sharing on element or something like that.\n\nSubjectively, I think it's a bug, because otherwise the consent mode stuff makes implementing a CMP much easier than previous iterations.",

I am using CookieYes which sends a cookie\\_consent\\_update DL event right after a Consent event.  You are saying to fire these tags on the cookie\\_consent\\_update DL event, but I don't see how to avoid using a trigger group here.  For example, say I have a custom\\_purchase DL event... now I would need to fire the tag on custom\\_purchase AND cookie\\_consent\\_update right?  So only when both events have happened does it fire.\n\nAnother example would be Bing UET Tag... rather than firing on Initialization All Pages I would fire on cookie\\_consent\\_update DL event?  Can't cookie\\_consent\\_update firing multiple times (say if a user kept changing their consent on the same page) really screw up these tags... firing multiples and what not which could skew analytics for example?",

Use sequencing to make it run prior to all of the supporting event tags. Event tags checked to make sure they fire on or after cookie\\_consent\\_update.\n\nIf the config / setup tag is responsible for sending a page view event to the platform, fix it so that it doesn't and instead figure out an event tag separately to send a page view. I do this with every platform anyway because it's just a good idea all around.\n\nAlso... I am not a fan of trigger groups. They don't work intuitively and they harken back to the bad old days when cookie banners and GTM integration was first invented.

The reason is for those first pageview hits to google platforms wont be picked up on those landing pages. I also suggest firing a second ga4 page view event after a user clicks accept analytics cookies on the cookie banner as otherwise you can see not set landing pages in your ga4 reporting :(\n\nAlso great debugging technique, but i also recommend checking in addition to this the network hits of your google tags events and check the gcs ans gcd query parameters in the payload that will finalise it is working 100 percent to that specific website.\n\nAlso I love your pronunciation of Re(eeee)gEx Tables ü§£\n\nGreat work üôå",

        "selftext": "There haven't been many posts about Google Consent Mode in this subreddit, but there are a couple of common misconceptions which I've seen caused people to lose a lot of time trying to chase down a faulty implementation.\n\n1. Google native tags fire unexpectedly when there is no user consent.\n2. \"additional consent\" works exactly like an exception / blocking trigger.\n\nTrying to write up a complete how-to for implementing Google Consent Mode is a big project far outside the scope of a Reddit post or even a reasonbly sized blog entry.\n\nThe basics though:-\n\n1. \"CoMo\" is a good shorthand for Google Consent Mode and it's what Google use when discussing it.\n2. CoMo usually works alongside or is implemented by an existing consent management platform, such as CookieBot or OneTrust.\n3. CoMo affects all Google tags such as GA4 Config and Event, Conversion Linker, Floodlights and Google Ads.\n4. Google tags *should* fire without consent (in Tag Assistant in preview mode).\n5. Presence of the \"gcs\" parameter in network hits indicates CoMo is active.\n6. gtag.js retriggers Google tags when the user grants consent / when consent is established on each page load.\n7. You *will not* see tags retrigger in Tag Assistant in preview mode. Chrome dev console, network tab only.\n\nThere are many ways to implement CoMo incorrectly and validating an implementation is a 15-20 minute process.\n\nI can go into more detail if you are struggling with any part of CoMo or consent management in general.",

If there IS a consent banner, you should respect a user's choice if they decline, and NOT fire GTM marketing / analytics tags.

Personally, if it's a small business,  it's probably fine. If it's a larger organization, I always defer to their legal team as there are varying levels of risk tolerance.\n\nMy Initial point was that the worst thing you can do is set ad/marketing/analytics cookies on a user's device from GTM if they have clicked \"decline\" on a cookie consent banner.\n\nhope that helps; interested in seeing if other people have different opinions.",

First, make them require additional consent to fire. FB needs both ad_storage and analytics_storage, but Clarity only needs the latter.\n\nSecond, add an additional trigger to them besides All pages. This changes from CMP to CMP but you are basically looking for an event that happens when the user changes their consent and the update command fires. For Cookiebot for example, this would be \"cookie_consent_update\". This ensures that tags will be able to fire directly on the landing page instead of the second page, where the source/medium is already lost for example.",

If I would need to use compatible extension, I would need to remove current working extension and go through a lot of customization work which is not a solution at this point. Let's not consider it for this thread.  \n3rd party CMPs with free plans are also not in the radius. Let's not consider it.  \nBecause of that I'm thinking to implement 3rd party solution and then use Consent mode template inside GTM which can catch consent mode v2 states.  \nSo the missing part is a cookie consent banner which can generate calls to data layer with consent states.  \nDo we have something in open source space for this? From what I've checked, most of the solutions are really poor in functionality and/or outdated.  \nIt would be great to get your valuable input.  \n",

If it has value, the data originally collected will almost certainly be subject to privacy laws / guidance applicable in the various jurisdictions.\n\nSimply assigning a persistent user ID puts the data in scope. Reading or writing persistent / semi-persistent data from / to the user's browser needs scrutiny. You would have a hard time arguing Leadfeeder is \"essential\" or a \"legitimate interest\"\n\nWorth mentioning, I'm no expert on the laws involved, but if you ever hear anyone use \"essential\" or \"legitimate interest\" to describe their desire to collect user data, they are using a faulty interpretation. \"essential\" is what the *user* would consider essential. \"legitimate interest\" is what the *user* would consider legitimate.  (even if my interpretation is incorrect, I still think it's a good way to go about it)\n\nGating the platform behind consent is the correct thing to do.\n\nSome (very few) platforms have their own ability to be provided with or read the consent preference the user has indicated and adjust the data collection to anonymise the collected data (or not).\n\nGoogle has Google Consent Mode for this.\n\nFacebook, if it still does support it, can \"stack\" events until the user provides consent, at which point it will send all the data back to their servers. I set this up once, but it's a shaky argument to say \"the user consented during purchase, so that means we will back-date that consent to all the pages they previously visited\".",

But when it comes to e-commerce functionality, they also rely on Google Tag defined through the WooCommerce plugin. This ensures proper functioning of the data layer and provides e-commerce events. On the other hand, it seems that the Google Tag from WooCommerce is loaded before the CMP, and this has led to some complications in configuring this combination effectively.  \nI'm reaching out to the community to seek advice on the best practices for configuring WooCommerce, Google Tag Manager, and a consent management tool like Cookiebot. I want to ensure that our e-commerce events work seamlessly while also maintaining compliance with GDPR. One way would be to define the ecommerce events manually, and keep the Google Tag only in the GTM, but I hope there would be a more simple way to do it.",

Deactivate \"Send a page view...\" in the GA4 Configuration tag.\n3. Create a GA4 Event tag with an event name \"page\\_view\" and fire using an All Pages trigger.\n4. Remove Simo's Consent Mode tags and template.\n5. Unless you have non-Google tags (Facebook?) also remove the Lookup Table.\n6. If you have non-Google tags, still remove the lookup table and replace with two RegEx Tables where the input for both is the content of OneTrustActiveGroups and you return \"granted\" when the string contains \",C0002,\" for one tag (usually this is analytics consent) and \",C0003,\" for the other tag (usually marketing / targeting / ad\\_storage) *You should give users the option to manage both consent categories!*\n7.

Make sure you have Google Consent Mode switched on within OneTrust. OneTrust / CookiePro will then take care of the Consent Mode \"update\" command at the exact correct moment.\n\nAdditionally I would recommend switching off as much of GA4's Enhanced Measurement as possible. If you really need scroll tracking or file download tracking, implement a tag for it. Don't let GA4 auto-collect user data. Privacy laws talk about only collecting data you know you need and you can always do a better job with a tag than GA4 can do with Enhanced Measurement.",

My plan is to enable the Google Consent mode with existing OneTrust script (with Google Consent Mode turned on in the admin), then slowly update each tag to fire depending on this consent mode, instead of the OneTrust default triggers.\n\nWhat I have done so far\n\n* Enabled Google Consent mode in OneTrust admin\n* Added gtag('consent', 'default', { ad\\_storage: 'denied' }); in the application\n* Enabled Google Consent Mode in GTM\n* Updated the tag to use Google Consent Mode\n* Replace the trigger of the tag to All Pages, instead of the blocking trigger by OneTrust\n* All OneTrust cookies banner script remains the same in cHTML\n\nWhat is working\n\n* The respective tag is denied when application loaded\n* When user accepts the banner, the tag will fire\n\nWhat is not working\n\n* If user refreshes the page or after the page load, Google Consent Mode back to 'denied' but OneTrust banner state is 'Accepted'.\n* It seems like Google Consent mode will work once\n\nQuestion\n\n1.

It essentially hasn't changed in at least 5 years.\n\nIntegration comprises a Custom HTML tag that runs a script that creates an event listener that then sends one or more data layer events with names like...\n\nGDPR Pref Allows 1\n\nGDPR Pref Allows 2\n\nGDPR Pref Allows 3\n\nThis makes it awkward to control a tag that requires both level 2 and 3 consent (2 = analytics, 3 = marketing). You can do it, but it's just not \"nice\".\n\nThere's a GitHub Gist: [https://gist.github.com/shadybones/71617252fd8814d1b9f9a6114030f63a](https://gist.github.com/shadybones/71617252fd8814d1b9f9a6114030f63a) that's been around since 2018 and this is the code you put in a Custom HTML tag and fire on every page. Funnily enough, this is pretty much exactly how [trustarc.com](https://trustarc.com) implements it. You can see it (if you look carefully) in their own GTM container [https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-T3CS5GN](https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-T3CS5GN)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've forked the Gist ([https://gist.github.com/stefanatcroud/cd103ecfabf7dbe37d6a13d01557775f](https://gist.github.com/stefanatcroud/cd103ecfabf7dbe37d6a13d01557775f)) to work a little more like OneTrust's data layer output, so we can have a single data layer push that looks like:-\n\n    {\n    event: \"TrustArc Consent\",\n    trustarc: {\n        consent: \"1,2,3\"\n    }\n\n}\n\nSuper easy to work with inside GTM.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI've updated the script so that where previously you would see \"GDPR Pref Allows 0\" (i.e. for new users landing on your site, prior to making a consent choice), there's a new event \"TrustArc Pre-Consent\" with no event data.\n\nThis separates the \"there's been a genuine consent choice by the user\" event name from \"there's no previous record of this user's consent choice\", which further simplifies triggering rules in GTM.",

This is where I get confused and could use some help. Here's what I think is happening; the CMP JavaScript code has a way to disable functionality in 3rd party tracking tag code, preventing that code from setting any cookies. This would require the CMP code to fire first, and would also require the CMP code to correctly identify and disable any subsequent code that could set a cookie. Am I correct in my understanding?\n\nIf so, this sounds like an easy to deploy process, but not very robust or performant, or am I missing something? \n\nthanks!",

The CMP will then handle dynamically changing this if it decides consent is present.\n\nIn general, I tell clients \"no hardcoded scripts. We need everything to be in GTM\" and also push to implement Google Consent Mode, because this is useful in terms of maintaining consent management without worrying about random scripts appearing as well as theoretically providing the balance of respecting user privacy whilst still collecting some data that can be useful.",

I'm not saying you haven't, but your uncertainty and the mention of trigger groups indicates you might not have.\n\nAre you using any of the popular consent management platforms such as CookieBot, CookiePro (OneTrust), TrustArc etc? They all have specific methods of correctly implementing triggers based on a custom event. e.g. \"cookie\\_consent\\_update\" is CookieBot's effective replacement for \"all pages\". That event fires on every page at the point where CookieBot's script has run *or* when the user makes their consent choice.\n\nTrigger groups are best avoided unless fully understood and probably never should be used for consent management. Cleaner, less difficult to debug and maintain options exist.\n\nedit: You should test this. You can add e.g. \"?gclid=Test123\" onto your URL and check whether \"Test123\" is correctly copied into a cookie when consent is granted. If it is, the tag is working. If it only works on the landing page, you need to use preview mode and tag assistant to figure out how to trigger the tag.",

        "selftext": "Hi All.\n\nI have setup a site with Universal Analytics to use the Tag Manager consent features in conjunction with a Consent Platform and all is working fine on that front. The problem I have is that when a visitor does not give consent to analytics cookies, even though the analytics hits are still sent to Google Analytics, this data does not show up in any reports.\n\nApparently this a known issue (Thanks to [/u/sahava](https://www.reddit.com/u/sahava/) for his [blog post](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/consent-mode-google-tags/#restrict-analytics-storage) that helped me finally figure out what was going on) and is due to a new parameter gcs, which includes the consent status of the hit. All traffic with the gcs parameter set doesn't show up at all in the Analytics dashboard.\n\nAs this is a news publisher site, Analytics numbers are very important so I am trying to figure out a workaround. So far I have come up with two possible ideas but have no clue if they are possible or how to implement.\n\n1. One workaround would be to remove the gcs parameter from the hits sent to Analytics. Is this possible? Any pointers to documentation or code that shows how this could be done would be really appreciated. I did try google with no luck.\n2. The second workaround would be to use the \"storage: none\" method as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4502128/convert-google-analytics-cookies-to-local-session-storage/19207035#19207035). While this works fine and hits are sent and counted without cookies being set, I can't figure out a way to update this if a user consents to setting cookies. What value should storage be set to for normal operation with cookies? Is is possible to push a new config value with gtag commands that takes effect without refreshing the page?\n\nI would really appreciate any pointers or feedback on the ideas above or to hear any other suggestions or solutions that might help solve this problem.",

You can create a single tag with multiple individual triggers that cover the different cases where you want it to fire. \n\nYou can also just use one trigger if you're down to use a regex match on URLs or text, but it's a bit more advanced if you're not familiar with regular expressions.

        "author": "pongohopper",
        "id": "1k26zbe",
        "selftext": "So here is the scenario.  An order processor I am using supposedly requires that GA4 be setup in GTM with the following custom html tag rather than a Google Tag :\n\n    <script async src = \"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id={{ga4-tracking-id}}\"></script>\n    <script>\n    function gtag() {\n    dataLayer.push(arguments);\n    }\n    gtag('js', new Date());\n    if (!window.clsid) {\n        gtag('config', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', {\n            'cookie_flags': 'SameSite=None;Secure',\n            'page_referrer': '{{fsc-referrer}}',\n            'page_location': '{{fsc-url}}',\n        });\n        window.clsid = {\n            client_id: '',\n            session_id: ''\n        };\n        gtag('get', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', 'client_id', function(r) {\n            window.clsid.client_id = r\n        });\n        gtag('get', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', 'session_id', function(r) {\n            window.clsid.session_id = r\n        });\n    } else {\n        gtag('config', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', {\n            'client_id': window.clsid.client_id,\n            'session_id': window.clsid.session_id,\n            'cookie_flags': 'SameSite=None;Secure',\n            'page_referrer': '{{fsc-referrer}}',\n            'page_location': '{{fsc-url}}'\n        });\n    } \n    </script>\n\nThere reasoning for this isn't clear and after contacting them about it and if it was possible to just use a regular Google Tag they were clueless and of no help at all.\n\n{{fsc-referrer}} and {{fsc-url}} are not a big deal and I always have access to them.  Other than that the only variable used is {{ga4-tracking-id}} which I of course have also.\n\nThe reason I want to change over to a Google Tag instead of the above custom html is because of the built-in consent checks that come with the Google Tag - a custom html tag does not have these.  I want to take advantage of consent mode v2 where it can still track events even without consent given.\n\nLooking at the code I don't see a whole lot going on other than the custom cookie\\_flags, page\\_referrer, and page\\_location parameters.  client\\_id and session\\_id shouldn't even need to be set right because that will just happen automatically I would think, but then why the if/else depending on if window.clsid exists or not?\n\nI am just trying to make sense of the code and what it is actually accomplishing over just using a plain old Google Tag instead.  If it makes a difference the order processor's checkout pages, which is the most important part here because I want to track the checkout process and sales, is hosted on their domain and not mine.  The checkout process appears to load inline or within an iframe 'in' my own hosted html - that is accomplished with js.  I'll also add that they load my gtm on their side with my container id as well.",

From what I gather, it seems like the client and session ids stored in `window.clsid` are used by the custom link decorator function. This function is used to manually decorate the callback URLs of the storefront.¬†\n\n\n\n\n**Why do they need a custom link decorator when the Google tag already handles this automatically?**\nThe Google tag linker only decorates `<a>` link elements by default. Since the checkout redirect is most likely handled programmatically (the user never clicks a link element to trigger the navigation) the linker parameters aren't appended to the destination URL. Passing client and session ids allows you to manually stitch the visit without using linker parameters.\n\n\n\n\nWhile this does get the job done there are a number of improvements that could be made here. It would for example be much more preferable to generate a linker parameter and pass that on instead of client and session ids. This would allow the Google tag to stitch the visit automatically instead of having to manually map the ids to the tag. Although I won't go into much detail on this and will try to focus is solving your issue as it is presented.\n\n\n\n\nAll of this code can be updated to work with the GTM Google Tag:\n\n1. Create two Google Tags. Tag A, which is blocked if `window.clsid` is defined and Tag B, which is blocked when `window.clsid` is `undefined`.\n\n\n2. Configure Tag A according to the config seen in the if-statement.\n\n\n3. Configure Tag B according to the config seen in the else-statement.\n\n\n4. Create a custom HTML tag with the following code:\n```html\n<script>\n¬†¬†¬† window.clsid = window.clsid || {\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† client_id: '',\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† session_id: ''\n¬†¬†¬† };\n¬†¬†¬† window.gtag = window.gtag || function gtag() {\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† dataLayer.push(arguments);\n¬†¬†¬† }\n¬†¬†¬† gtag('get', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', 'client_id', function(r) {\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† window.clsid.client_id = r\n¬†¬†¬† });\n¬†¬†¬† gtag('get', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', 'session_id', function(r) {\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† window.clsid.session_id = r\n¬†¬†¬† });\n</script>\n```\n¬†¬† 5. Save the custom HTML tag without a trigger.\n\n¬†¬† 6. Go to Tag A and use tag sequencing to fire the custom HTML tag **after** Tag A has fired.\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration outlined above **should** provide the same results as the original code while allowing the use of the built-in Google Tag.",

Here's a summary of my setup and the problem:\n\nMy GA4 config tag has built-in consent checks and triggers on 'Initialization - All Pages'.\n\nThe CookieYes configuration tag in GTM has default consent settings set to 'disabled' and triggers on 'Consent Initialization - All Pages'.\n\nThe Problem:\nIn Google DebugView, I see that CookieYes sends an automatic cookie consent update to GTM. After the user interacts with the cookie banner, a second consent update is sent. This seems to cause GA4 to incorrectly classify over 90% of traffic as 'Direct', which is obviously not correct.\n\nPreviously, with other CMPs, I triggered the GA4 tag on 'cookie consent update' and it worked with a single event when the user actually updated their consent.\n\nCould anyone provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the GA4 tag and the CookieYes tag to work together properly? I need to troubleshoot this to ensure accurate traffic attribution.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

CookieYes sends an initial consent state (defaulted to ‚Äúdenied‚Äù) and then updates it once the user interacts with the banner. So GA4 respects that and adjusts accordingly.\n\nNow here‚Äôs where the issue comes in:\n\nOn first page load, GA4 fires but sees consent as ‚Äúdenied,‚Äù so it doesn‚Äôt collect identifiable data. UTM parameters like source/medium/campaign do appear in DebugView, which tells me they‚Äôre being passed but they don‚Äôt carry over into real-time or standard reports unless the user accepts cookies and then refreshes or navigates to another page.\n\nThis seems to be because UTM data is only available via document.location and document.referrer on the first page load. If the user consents after that first load, and GA4 only starts collecting data then, the original attribution context is gone so the session is marked as Direct.\n\nSo it‚Äôs not that GA4 is blocked from firing it‚Äôs that it fires before consent is granted, and once consent is updated, GA4 starts collecting but by then the attribution info has already been lost.\n\nSession counts seem fine, it‚Äôs just that the quality of attribution is poor unless the user refreshes or navigates after accepting.

                "body": "Haha funny! ITotally agree with you ChatGPT can be useful, but it definitely has a habit of confidently suggesting overcomplicated solutions, especially when you‚Äôre trying to debug consent or tagging issues.\n\nFor example, in my case, ChatGPT suggested I disable the default page view by setting send_page_view: false in the GA4 config tag. Then, I was supposed to create a separate GA4 page_view event tag that would only trigger when analytics_storage = granted, using a custom event like cookie_consent_update and a Data Layer Variable {{dlv - analytics consent}} set to granted.\n\nIn theory, that would delay the page view until after consent and preserve UTM parameters but the issue was that CookieYes wasn‚Äôt pushing any analytics_storage consent updates into the Data Layer. The DataLayer variable just stayed \"undefined\" even after users accepted cookies. So the trigger never fired, and no page_view was sent at all.\n\nWhat‚Äôs strange is that I couldsee in GTM's Consent tab that the consent status was updated to \"granted\", but since CookieYes was handling it internally and not pushing that to the Data Layer, it broke ChatGPT‚Äôs whole approach.\n\nSo yeah, I‚Äôm struggling a bit here. I‚Äôve spent hours trying to get UTM parameters to persist correctly. I can see in GTM Debug Mode that the initial page view is being sent before consent is granted, and I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs where the UTM data is captured and lost.\n\nOnly after users accept cookies and navigate to another page does a new page view get triggered and that shows up as the first page view in GA4‚Äôs DebugView, which confirms that attribution is getting lost right at the start.\n\nCan anyone confirm if that‚Äôs likely the root cause? And if so, what‚Äôs the best way to solve it?\n\nReally appreciate any insight this one's been driving me mad for days!!",

That means GA4 doesn't capture source/medium data unless consent is given, so traffic that *should* be attributed ends up labelled as ‚ÄòDirect‚Äô.\n\nTo address this:\n\n* **Google‚Äôs Advanced Consent Mode V2** can help. It allows tags to send cookieless pings *before* consent is given. These are used by Google to model user behaviour but aren‚Äôt shown in your actual GA4 reports, they just help fill in the gaps.  \n* Full tracking only kicks in once the user accepts analytics cookies. If most visitors don't consent, GA4 ends up labeling a big chunk of traffic as 'Direct'.\n\n\n\nEven with these features in place, you may still see major gaps in reported traffic if users don‚Äôt accept tracking cookies. To stay GDPR compliant, analytics tools must respect user consent, so you can‚Äôt collect complete tracking data without explicit permission.\n\nRefer: [https://www.cookieyes.com/documentation/drop-in-traffic-on-google-analytics-after-adding-cookieyes/](https://www.cookieyes.com/documentation/drop-in-traffic-on-google-analytics-after-adding-cookieyes/)\n\nIf you need help troubleshooting your setup or setting the tag behavior correctly, feel free to email us at [support@cookieyes.com](mailto:support@cookieyes.com).",

If you're not planning on adding more tags, events, and so on, it's ok to leave your existing setup if it's working.\n\nIf you want to move over to GTM, you have to deploy your GTM script, recreate your existing setup in GTM via tags and triggers, consent mode settings, etc, and finally remove the GA4 script from your website. You'll have to do some reading to figure out how everything should be configured to work correctly, but there are lots of free resources out there like Analytics Mania.\n\n>if tags should be merged\n\nGTM can't be merged with other tags, because it's a tag manager/container. It sounds like you've got GA4 and Google Ads already merged and it's ok to leave them like that. If you migrate them to GTM, you'd have 1 Google tag for both (to reflect that they're merged) instead of 2 Google tags (1 for each; that's necessary for people who have separate tags for GA4 and Google Ads, and thus need separate tags in GTM as well).\n\n>you don't need to install multiple individual ID tags and that config options can be shared across tags\n\nThis depends not on GTM, but on your current tag structure (see above). In your case that would be 1 tag (more tags if you decide to add event tracking, conversion tracking, etc in the future). Config options can be set up from the Google Tag settings outside of GTM; you can also set them in GTM but it's not necessary. And the config sharing options are useful for more complex GTM setups, which is not the case yet for you.\n\nIf you decide to migrate, be very very careful about your cookie consent and consent mode setup, refer to the official documentation of the tool you're using.",

        "selftext": "I was recently invited to evaluate Ketch, which positions itself as a competitor to OneTrust as a CMP.\n\nThe tl;dr is it is still not in a state where I would recommend it to a client. It's not that it doesn't work or it doesn't have some good features, it is because it still has a poor GTM integration.\n\nThe premise is actually good. You have the option (and it seems like a default \"do it this way\") to directly link a GTM container to the Ketch service and it will automatically manage your tags for consent.\n\nWhere it falls down is when you want to do the \"advanced\" GTM implementation, because the guidance for dealing with 3rd-party tags (Facebook etc) is to use a trigger group based on page view and a specific data layer event emitted by Ketch.\n\nWhy a trigger group? That's because Ketch haven't solved the problem that practically every other CMP has solved, which is to provide a data layer event that can be used as a direct replacement for an All Pages trigger, but it fires after consent is established and also after Google Consent Mode has updated its state. Effectively, Ketch is advising to use a non-optimal and fairly old fashioned method to control consent for 3rd-party tags.\n\nIf you've used GTM for any length of time, you have probably used a trigger group. If you've tried to use a trigger group for anything interesting, you'll have discovered that it has a major limitation of a trigger group never being re-evaluated, meaning if any part of the group fails to fire you have zero opportunity for the group to fire until the next page load, no matter what events occur. Trigger groups are not an \"and\" condiion for triggers!\n\nThe other major failing is there is no native tag template for the main Ketch script. There's a required tag template to manage Google Consent Mode integration... there's a version in the community gallery, but it's not the same version as the one they want you to download and then import.\n\nYou can do a Custom HTML tag with the Ketch script, but this is not great in terms of timing.\n\nSo... sadly, the recommendations are still CookieBot, CookieYes, Enzuzo, UserCentrics and OneTrust, depending on features and budget.",

Healthcare field. I set it up the same way on both sites on the same date, but it's only working on one. GTM preview mode shows success on both sites. Details:\n\n- Wordpress sites\n- GTM is installed via the WP plugin called \"Site Kit\"\n- tag is GA4 Event\n- trigger is clicks - just links \"click URL starts with tel:\"\n- For both sites, it appears GA4 is installed within the Site Kit GA4 option AS WELL AS a container inside of GTM. It's the same on both. \n\nThe ONLY difference I can see is that in Site Kit inside WP, in the module where GTM gets installed, on the site where it's not working, at the bottom there is a message that says \"Placing two tags at the same time is not recommended.\" and I'm not sure what that means. Does that mean GTM is stalled twice? Is GA4 installed twice?\n\nI installed both of these on Friday, May 9. Again, verified that both were firing properly via tag manager preview. Didn't look all weekend. On Monday I verified the event was populating in GA4 on one site but not the other.  \n\nI'm stumped. Please help?\n\nUPDATE: So it's looking like the consent issues here are restricted on GA4 and it's not necessarily an issue with Site Kit. I had hoped to keep the tag as a GA4 event so I could track on all channels, but ultimately decided to create the tag as a Ads conversion and it's now recording just fine. Not ideal but better than nothing. Now that I'm at least getting that data to come in, I'll be more comfortable working with their team to find other solutions to track across all channels over time. \n\nMeanwhile, if I could just figure out why my Google Hosted 'All Conversions' aren't populating.....

It is better to have a CMP (CookieBot, Axeptio, Didomi, etc.) which manages all of this from GTM. \nSo unfortunately I can't help you much more. In general it takes a little audit to go further and really know what to do. \nWordPress can quickly get out of hand!

Possibly **streamline consent handling** across the main site and the booking engine.\n\nHas anyone faced this kind of cross-domain consent fragmentation before?  \nAny tips on how to:\n\n* Sync consent across domains?\n* Leverage server-side GTM or GAds conversion linker better in these cases?\n* Apply workarounds like click ID forwarding or 1st party cookies across redirect chains?\n\nWould really appreciate any insights, examples, or tools that helped you solve something similar!\n\nThanks a lot in advance üôè",

Shopify, custom site, tag-heavy CMS?

        "selftext": "After answering a bunch of questions around **Shopify + GA4 + GTM**, I figured it might help to write up some of the common issues we‚Äôve seen come up again and again, especially for anyone dealing with eCommerce tracking chaos.\n\nWe‚Äôve been digging into this a lot lately helping store owners, marketers, and even devs who are *\"pretty sure GA4 is set up right\"*‚Ä¶ only to find out it's tracking like 30% of what it should be.\n\n# Problems That Keep Coming Up:\n\n**1. GA4 is installed, but no purchase data is showing.**\n\nUsually means no enhanced eCommerce events are being sent. Pageviews ‚â† conversions.\n\n**2. Purchase events only fire sometimes or show 0 value.**\n\nHappens when GA4 is wired through the wrong trigger or missing transaction parameters.\n\n**3. Add-to-cart, checkout steps, and other funnel events aren‚Äôt being captured.**\n\nEven though they‚Äôre critical for optimization and retargeting, most setups only send basic page data.\n\n**4. Attribution is broken, especially across devices or with Safari users.**\n\nGCLID, fbclid, UTM data often gets lost without first-party cookies + proper session stitching.\n\n**5. Shopify‚Äôs built-in Google channel and a separate GTM setup are both running (causing duplicate events).**\n\nThis one‚Äôs subtle you don‚Äôt notice until you‚Äôre wondering why ROAS in Ads looks off.\n\n**6. Cookie banners or consent tools silently block tags.**\n\nThe event fires‚Ä¶ but only if the stars align and consent is granted at the right time.\n\n# We‚Äôve been helping stores troubleshoot all of this here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been working:\n\n* First-party cookie setup to preserve UTM and ad click data\n* Server-side tagging (yes, even on Shopify Basic) to rescue Safari/iOS users\n* Clean GA4 event structure that maps directly to eCommerce goals\n* Consistent session and event tracking across landing pages, shop pages, and thank-you page\n* DebugView + Tag Assistant + ‚Äúsanity checks‚Äù to make sure nothing breaks mid-funnel\n\nIf you‚Äôre in the middle of this and not sure why your GA4 purchase data doesn‚Äôt match your actual store orders, you‚Äôre not alone. GA4 + Shopify has a lot of \"gotchas\" that aren‚Äôt obvious until you start relying on the data to make ad decisions.\n\nWe‚Äôve been building out some solutions around this (happy to share what's worked for us if you're curious just drop a comment or shoot a message).\n\nBut in the meantime, if you‚Äôre struggling with GA4 + Shopify tracking and wondering if it‚Äôs just you it‚Äôs not. üòÖ\n\nWould love to hear how others are solving this. Is anyone here using GTM fully? Apps? Manual tagging? What‚Äôs worked and what hasn‚Äôt?",

        "selftext": "Update: was just on the phone with Google Support (got a hold of somebody via the Google Ads support) and they said that for some reason my debug view in GA4 is just not working properly but analytics IS actually tracking everything so.. I guess I'm good lol. Still a bit strange but at least I didn't do anything incorrectly haha.\n\n\\----\n\nSo I've set up a bunch of tags to track a variety of events. The confusing thing is that they all fire in preview (and during that also in the GA4 debug view). When I go to the same pages to trigger the same tags, tag assistant confirms that those tags were fired BUT debug view does NOT show any events. Not even the page views from my GA4 Config tag for page initializations. My website is on Wix (planning on moving to Wordpress in the near future).\n\nWix: under marketing integrations, I've connected Google Tag Manager **and** Google Tag. I've tested disabling the Google Tag option here and that made no difference. I also disabled the cookie consent banner briefly, again no events sent in debug view.\n\nThis is how the tag is set up (I followed Analytics Mania's video most recent video on this):  \n\\- Tag configuration: Google Tag  \n\\- Tag ID: the data stream ID from GA4 (triple checked that it's the right ID)  \n\\- triggering: initialization - all pages\n\nGranted, I'm very new to GTM and GA4 so I must have obviously missed something but I've been racking my brain and can't figure out what.\n\nI double checked the data filters and made sure to switch off the \"internal traffic\" filter. I do have a cookie consent banner on my website but even after accepting that, the event still doesn't show in GA4.\n\nI don't have any ad blockers on my browser (Google Chrome). I downloaded Firefox and went to my home page, still no page\\_view event shown in the GA4 Debug View (same for the Admin Debug View).\n\nI've also read that debug view can be delayed, so I've waited to see what it shows. Nothing. Whereas when I'm in preview, the event usually shows up after a minute or so.\n\nIf tag assistant is confirming the tag fired and the event was sent, something must be wrong with GA4, right? Honestly, my brain feels fried from trying to figure this out all day. I just don't get why it works in preview but not outside of that? (again, I'm very new to this stuff. Forgive me if I'm missing something obvious here)\n\nAny help is highly appreciated. I want to run Google Search Ads soon but I want to make sure everything's tracked properly.",

The defaults are still being treated as denied.\n\nQuestions:\nHas anyone else seen HubSpot CMP override Consent Mode values after interaction?\nHow can I stop consent states from being overwritten when a user accepts?\nIs there a recommended way to intercept or preserve the values during/after banner interaction?\nCould this be a sequencing issue between HubSpot and GTM tags?\n\nAny help would be hugely appreciated‚Äîthank you in advance!

I think this is a pretty simple problem to solve.\n\nHere's the situation:  \nInitially I listened to the analytics of my website through a Google Tag (when you open Google Tag Manager you have two tabs: Account and Google Tags.

It was working fine, until I had to implement consent.\n\nI created a Google Tag Manager container where I put a custom HTML tag from Sliktide (not relevant) and, after testing it in preview, it worked correctly. Then I was worried because I thought that the Google Tag I had linked to Ads and Analytics was sending data even though the user didn't consent, so I deleted that Google Tag and created one inside the container linked to my measurement id G-BLABLABLA that gets activated only when the user consents, but when I test it (by going, for example, on my website and doing some things, even with a VPN to be sue it doesn't get filtered) I don't get anything in Analytics.\n\nJust to be clear: on my website I only have my GTM-BLABLA tag installed, not any other ID.",

        "selftext": "So a lot of of conversions are being lost in Google Ads because \"Default Consent (Global)\" is being set to \"Denied\" for the tag that I setup for my consent banner in GTM (Google Tag Manager).  I advertise globally.  Originally, what I tried to do was only display my consent banner for EU & UK, and not display it for the rest of the world.  The problem with this is, because \"Default Consent (Global)\" is being set to \"Denied\" in GTM, it doesn't seem to give customers outside the EU & UK a chance to accept the cookies (because the consent banner doesn't come up) and there is a loss of conversions being counted in Google Ads for customers outside the EU & UK. \n\nNow when I asked the CMP Partner of the consent banner I am currently using on what configuration I should use in GTM, the CMP Partner told me that I should set \"Default Consent (Global)\" to \"Granted\" and then in \"Default Consent (Region-specific),\" I should add UK and add each country in the EU and set them to \"Denied.\"  I then asked Google Ads support about this, and they contradicted the CMP Partner and said \"Default Consent (Global)\" should be set to \"Denied\" in GTM.  Mind you, I think I am in the lowest tier of support for Google Ads and at times, it seemed like the staff I was interacting with were not trained well.\n\nFast forward two months later, I am considering using a completely different consent banner with a completely different CMP Partner, that also offers the option to bring up the consent banner only for EU & UK customers.  When I asked this second CMP Partner what the GTM configuration should be if I only show their consent banner to EU & UK customers, they said the same thing as my current CMP Partner and repeated the same GTM settings! \n\nThat's two different CMP Partners, who recommend if you only display their banner in the EU & UK, to set set \"Default Consent (Global)\" to \"Granted\" and then in \"Default Consent (Region-specific),\" I should add UK and add each country in the EU and set them to \"Denied.\"  Ergo, that is two different CMP Partners who are recommending the settings I make in GTM, go against what Google Ads support is saying.\n\nWhat I care about is whether my Google Ads account gets banned, if I follow the two CMP Partner instructions as outlined above, since it goes against the Google Ads support instructions. So my question is,  does Google Ads audit or check your GTM settings?  Or is GTM firewalled and Google Ads will never check my GTM settings?",

One that did not include a region definition that denied all consent by default. The second defined the region as 'US' and set default consent to granted.\n\nThis is probably not the perfect consent policy, but it reflects their policy as defined within OneTrust.\n\nTheir CMP (OneTrust) script is also hardcoded on site.\n\nYou don't have to do it this way and I've recently done a similar thing but instead using Simo's \"Consent Mode\" tag template in GTM. Not as neat, but it works.\n\nSo.... the point is it's possible to set the defailt consent differently based on geolocation. In your case, I would set all consent to granted by default but also define the list of regions where consent is denied by default. You can likely easily find the list of 2 letter country codes. Don't forget the UK. Not part of the EU now, but GDPR still applies.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm having a problem setting up advanced e-commerce tracking on a Shopify site using Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4).\n\n\n\n**Description of the problem:**\n\n**Missing events**: When I use GTM's preview mode to test my implementation, I find that when adding a product to the cart, specific events such as add\\_to\\_cart or view\\_item are not fired. Instead, only the form\\_start and form\\_submit events appear. I don't have any events related to ‚Äòitem‚Äô or the expected e-commerce tracking.\n\n**Intermittent loading of the GTM container:** In addition, I've noticed that when browsing the site during preview, the GTM-XXXXX container sometimes loads and sometimes doesn't, even when remaining on the same home page. This inconsistency makes diagnosis even more difficult.\n\n\n\n**What I've already checked:**\n\n**Presence of GTM code:** The GTM container code is present on all pages, placed immediately at the end of the <head> tag in the theme.liquid file.\n\n**Cache and extensions:** I've cleared my browser's cache, tested in private browsing mode, and disabled any extensions that might block scripts (such as ad blockers), but the problem persists.\n\n**Cookie Consent:** There is no cookie consent banner or CMP that could prevent the GTM from loading.\n\n\n\n**Additional information:**\n\n**Shopify Theme**: The site uses a custom theme. I have not made any recent changes to the theme that would explain this behaviour.\n\n**Third-party applications**: No third-party applications or scripts have been added or modified recently.\n\n**Other working site:** On another Shopify site I manage with a similar configuration, e-commerce tracking is working correctly, including add\\_to\\_cart and view\\_item events.\n\n\n\n**My questions :**\n\n**Missing e-commerce events:** Why are specific e-commerce events such as add\\_to\\_cart or view\\_item not being triggered when the corresponding actions are taken on the site?Do I have to manually configure the data layer for these events on Shopify? If so, how do I go about this?\n\n**Intermittent GTM loading:** What could be causing the GTM container to load randomly, even on the same page? Are there any specific settings to check or known Shopify issues that could explain this behaviour?\n\n\n\nI would be very grateful for any help or advice you could provide.

The fact that tags fire in preview but get blocked in production is a classic sign of this.\n\nFew things to check:\n\n1. Make sure you've implemented proper consent management - especially for ad-related tags. Those functions getting blocked (`__ogt_ads_datatos`, etc) are typically related to consent/privacy stuff\n\n1. For cross domain tracking - double check that both domains are properly configured in your GTM settings AND analytics property settings. Easy to miss one side\n\n1. Check if you're using any ad blockers or privacy extensions in your testing browser vs production\n\n1. Verify your GA4 configuration tag is firing before any other tags that depend on it\n\nWhat helped me solve this recently was implementing a consent management platform properly and making sure all advertising/analytics tags only fire after consent is granted. With b2b advertising specifically, getting this tracking setup right is super important for campaign optimization.\n\nhappy to share more specific tips if you need em - proper tracking setup makes a huge difference in campaign performance! lmk what u find when u check those items",

Instead it's all remained roughly the same in terms of stats.\n\nWe did also have our consent pop-up edited slightly in the same update but this I believe was just a content change to mention new cookies rather than change anything about the way it worked.",

In GTM preview mode it also looks like those events where somehow triggered by the automatically installed TikTok Tags.\n\nI then checked if there are some consent modes that have been activated with this implementation - but that doesn't seem to be the case. Container settings don't have any consent modes activated.\n\nTo be honest I am super clueless and I know it's very hard from an outside perspective to help me here - I am also trying with TikTok support (so far so bad) - but maybe anyone out here had the same or similar issue and figured out a way or a solution??\n\nThank you so much for your help in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nas far as I know there is some kind of update coming to the Shopify checkout, which basically disables the field under Settings -> Checkout that was used up until now to add the GTM container, all kinds of scripts (dataLayer, consent tool...) and other tracking codes.\n\nAccording to Shopify, if you still want to use Google Tag Manager to set up tracking in that way, you'd have to use this relatively new feature called Customer Events, which basically implements the scripts via a sandbox environment, which means you cannot just copy/paste the whole script. Depending on what type of script you want to add you have to modify the javascript (remove script tags, add a few lines here and there...).\n\nThis is the documentation for implementing the GTM container and dataLayer events:\n\n[https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/pixels/custom-pixels/gtm-tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/pixels/custom-pixels/gtm-tutorial)\n\nI tried this two times on two different shops. While it was possible to add the GTM container in this way, I was just not successful with getting the dataLayer events implemented into the website even though I was exactly following the instructions.  \n\nWhat are your experiences with this whole issue? Does anybody have- or know of a code piece that I could add as a custom pixel that'll implement the GTM container and the whole e-ecommerce dataLayer? Would be greatly appreciated. In principal, I think it's great to have a possiblity of adding the e-comm. dataLayer without being dependent on a developer or buying an expensive plugin like Analyzify. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work as expected.\n\nThanks a lot and best regards!\n\n",

                "body": "What Shopify did actually makes a lot of sense, basically they don't allow you to run arbitrary scripts on the checkout page now which can undermine security and affect page performance. The problem is that currently most major platforms expose their functionality via a script you run on the page through GTM like Meta Ads, Google Ads, Google Analytics etc (basically all tags in GTM parlance) This will just stop working now. The sandbox alternative Shopify provides does not support all browser APIs so naturally even if you somehow manage to include GTM, a lot of tags would silently break. \n\nUnfortunately there is no complete solution on the client anymore for Google tag manager. You may be able to implement some tags but like I said, some functionality would silently break and a lot of tags would just not work anymore. \n\n The solution is to implement server side tracking and subscribe to important events like checkout, purchase etc on server side, then you can implement all the tags on server side to process these events. This is a bit more complex than the client side setup but it is (nearly) a 1 to 1 replacement with client side GTM setup. It also has the benefit to track important events which are not generated on website, for example order cancellations, refund etc. You could forward these events to Google Analytics 4 to get a complete picture of customer journey. \n\nHope this helps.",

We use OneTrust as a Consent Management Platform (CMP) - could this be related to a configuration? Is it a setting in Google Ads? Or in GA4?

This has worked flawlessly.\n* In the past, we integrated GA4 directly via snippets into the website code. However, now that we‚Äôre using Google Tag as well, the GA4 snippet would be used twice since our GA4, Google Ads, and Google Tag are connected, this makes the direct snipped redundant, right?\n* Google Tag Manager is already firing our purchase events without any additional GA4 tag setup. Is this normal? Will I lose any tracking if I don‚Äôt set up an additional tag for GA4 and GoogleAds?\n* I am using a third-party booking software that sends the purchase event to GA4, and we‚Äôve connected the same purchase event in Google Ads. Am I correct in assuming that I don‚Äôt need to install the Google Ads tracking code (AW) additionally since the purchase data is already coming from GA4?\n\nLast but not least, the Google Ads tracking gets quite often lost between my WebSite and the final purchase event on the third-party website... in almost 30-50% of cases (it just indicates direct source in GA4), is there any trick to keep the attribution?\n\nThanks a lot!",

                "body": "1. Congrats!\n2. Right.\n3. This one is a little confusing. In theory, you don't need GA at all, to connect GTM and Google Ads. You can create a trigger, and, well, trigger the Google Ads conversion tag when it happens.\n\nFor example:  \n\\-> someone visits the \"thank you page\" -> Google Ads Conversion Tracking Tag is firing.\n\nThis will work. You're very likely to use exactly this set up for the Facebook/Twitter/Whatever pixel conversion tracking\n\nBut alternatively (preferably?), you can use the above trigger to trigger not the Google Ads conversion, but to send the event to GA.\n\nExample\n\n\\-> Someone visits the \"thank you page\" -> Google Analytics: GA4 Even Tag is firing.\n\nThat tag sent the event and other information you choose to sent, to Google Analytics, and you'll see it in the settings (admin) -> property -> Data display -> events (note, it may take 24 hours or more before you see it there).\n\nThen you can mark this event as **key event** (if it's named \"purchase\", then it's likely already marked that way)\n\nThen you just need to link the GA and Google Ads(property setting/ product links).\n\nAnd you can go to Google Ads, and you can import your Key events from GA as Goals (Goals -> Create Conversion Action -> Import)\n\n4) So it's more or less the same thing that point 3, but instead of the GTM sending the event to GA, Booking platform do it, right? Sounds like it may work. I would be cautiously optimistic  about it (but not an expert, or experienced in that area).",

But generally this issue comes from when you‚Äôre using a datalayer push followed immediately by a page redirect so if that push is in GTM then you can just add delay there.

So far, my experiments have returned 0 information in GA4. I've also made conversion tests, and in 1 out of 2 cases, the conversion has shown up in Google Ads but not in GA4.\n\nIs anybody else experiencing such inconsistencies?

It won't reflect that in Tag Assistant, but it will e.g. copy gclid into the relevant cookie(s).\n\nYou can test it by manually putting ?gclid=TEST123 in the URL and then searching TEST123 in the Application tab in dev tools.",

Everything was working fine untill the 12th of April.  \nWe setup the consent V2 last month and it is still set currently. When debugging I noticed that the conversion request was not being sent to Google on the network panel for the conversion tag when a \"begin\\_checkout\" trigger was fired (which is our conversion trigger), so I proceeded to manually do the dataLayer.push from the trigger into the console (just like google does on the background) and for some reason the conversion tag fired and it sent the request. I thought it would be something with the implementation of our tag manager setup and consent but I then tried something different: I reloaded the page and manually did the dataLayer push twice in a row for the conversion trigger (begin\\_checkout) and the first time once again didn't sent the request and the second did? Has something changed recently? Why is the trigger not sending the request the first time?  \nAll help would be appreciated, thank you.",

        "selftext": "Since a few weeks I have trouble loading in my GTM containers. Our company manages dozens of tag managers and last week a customer notified me that their scripts are not working. I tested in some other projects and had no problems, so the problem seemed customer specific. Since then i have discovered 2 other projects with the same problem.\n\nContext: I'm a back-end developer with technical background, so I'm experienced with debugging.\n\nI have tested on multiple devices, different networks, different browsers, disabled pieces of code to make sure there was no interference and got the same results. After you refresh the website a few times suddenly tag managers starts loading the scripts. Sometimes scripts load in after the first visit and when you refresh not anymore, so there is no consistency.\n\nI have spent so many hours searching on Google and Reddit for people with the same problems but cannot find them so this is my last resort. Most issues I can find are basic ones like forgetting to commit your container or using a wrong trigger. In my case this container worked and just stopped working on some occassions. I can only conclude at this moment that Google has some problems on their back-end. I live in Europe so maybe this is a consequence of the new DSA laws?\n\nWhen I use GTM preview function the Google Consent Mode default tag (this is the first tag which loads on consent initialization) shows it cannot fire. When I look at the errors tab it just show a list of errors without any details. I cannot find any page with more detail about the errors. The console in Dev Tools is also empty, no errors to be found over there.\n\nIn one of our customers Google Analytics it is very obvious that tag manager does not work. In this screenshot you can see there are barely any visitors that are getting tracked. Then suddenly the peak at Saturday May 11th and finally I removed tag manager at customers request and just put the GA4 script in the website code and the tracking worked fine.\n\nHas anyone encountered similar issues in the last weeks? Thanks in advance!\n\n  \n**SOLVED**: After months of searching I found the issue. In our codebase we use the global variable 'map' and this conflicted with Google Tag Manager. Quite weird as these websites worked for years and suddenly this was a problem. Renamed the global variable to GoogleMap and all issues dissapeared. Tag manager errors were gone and the GA4 tracking visitors numbers went back to normal.\n\nRemoved the screenshots as this case is closed.",

Everything looks to be working correctly, but the only thing I noticed is that no marketing tags fire until after someone refreshes the website. Given our 'websites' act more like Landing Pages with lengthy content promoting the product, this isn't ideal, as users don't find themselves navigating from sub-page to sub-page.\n\nI installed the Cookiebot tag via the official implementation guide on their website. I found solutions online suggesting adding a piece of code to the Cookiebot tag in GTM, that refreshes the website after accepting as follows:\n\n    function CookiebotCallback_OnAccept() {                                 \n    if (Cookiebot.changed) { document.location.reload(); } }\n\nI looked at adding this by editing the Cookiebot template, but I'm not a coder and not 100% sure where to add this, getting errors around 'Cookiebot' and 'document' not being defined, unable to save.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Can anyone suggest where to add this code to get it working? Or other solutions to the issue?",

You are tracking the user with cookieless pings and ads data redacted.\n\n\n\n\nIf the user for example clicks the add to cart button, an anonymous call will go out to GA and Gads. The user then decides to accept to be tracked. In this case, GA will send an additional request where all the information that it was not allowed to collect prior to the users consent is included.\n\n\nGads wants to do the same thing but can only do so if you've marked the conversion in GA as the conversion action will be pre-configured in the gtag.js file that the user fetched upon landing on your website.\n\n\n\n\nIf this does not matter and you're one of those people that respect the users choice by not tracking them unless they consent then you don't have to worry about it.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, and thanks in advance for your assistance!  \nI configured a  Google Tag Manager setup for a client and then aimed to replicate the entire setup on my own site, which is built in a very similar manner. I imported it, and almost everything is functioning correctly, except for the order in which the tags are firing.  \nI understand that I can adjust the priority in the designated area, but that's not the issue I'm facing. For instance, the first tag, which requests the user ID, fires on \"**consent**\" (the earliest possible trigger - for me? maybe you know smth else). However, the user ID value returns only after \"**window loaded**\". This scenario is unacceptable because all the configured tags are set to fire on \"**window loaded**\".  \nCurrently, my \"**window loaded**\" event occurs in position 7, but it should ideally be at position 15 like my client's page (from where I imported it), after everything else has loaded, such as the user hash, etc.  \nCould someone please provide me with tips on how to fix this and delay the window loaded or boost the other ones?",

We made the move to tag manager to implement consent mode easily. \n\nEverything is working okay, but there are a few things I'm not sure too about. \n\n1. GA4 events were set up inside GA4, I also created these events with the same name on GTM. Should these only be set up in one place? Someone had already set these up in GA4 before me. \n2. Our GA4 tag is connected to universal analytics, but when adding the UA tag in GTM, it wasn't sending back data to GA4, so I created a separate tag for GA4 in GTM alongside the UA tag, which is working now. Would this cause an issue, having it set this way? \n3. We removed G Ads tracking from the website, and I've added it to GTM. The conversion tracking events/Goals are also created in GTM to fire on Pageview when a user lands on the thank you page. You can only get to the thank you page if you follow the purchase journey on the site. You can't randomly visit the thank you page. But I've been told by our dev that the conversion snippet from the old tracking is still on the thank you page. I've not noticed any changes in conversions on Google ads, all looks normal. But do you think we should remove the old snippet? as we only count 'one' conversion in Google ads, and the numbers do add up to what we're seeing in the backend. \n\nWe're also seeing the ;0 sign in Tag assistant depreciated, telling us it's a non-standard implementation, as well as missing no-script code, but this is implemented on our site. \n\nOur conversion tracking for all goals is set up based on a page view URL as a trigger. I'm in the process of setting up so that GTM can capture purchase events sent from the website as this will be more accurate. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",

To make sure everything is set up correctly before I move on, I've been doing all kinds of tests in GTM's Preview mode. What I've encountered is that sometimes when I'm debugging from the GTM-XXXX tag, it will not show up for some events. Most times it happens on the event \"purchaseComplete\", my \"thank you\" page, which is where I'm doing most tests. Maybe out of 50 times, it has happened 3-5 times so I'm worried that we might be missing out on capturing important conversion data.\r  \n\r  \nWhen this happens, I get the usual crossed out text with the usual error:\r  \n\"Google Tag: GTM-XXXX not found. Please verify that the tag: Is installed on this page. Is not being blocked (by a browser extension or a consent dialog).\"\r  \n\r  \nSay we get 500 conversions a day, and if this were to happen 30-50 times, we would lose about 5-10% of our conversion data every day.\r  \n\r  \nWhat I'm wondering is whether this issue is only related to Preview mode, or if GTM actually isn't loading correctly on the thank-you page at times, which would mean we're losing conversion data, because if the GTM tag is not loading, then the conversion tag won't fire either.",

This was a bit more complicated to set up, but totally resolved the problem. Here's the guide I followed:  \n\n\nhttps://www.analyticsmania.com/post/datalayer-push/",

Consent Mode receives users‚Äô consent choices via the third party‚Äôs custom implementation. The third party uses ‚Äúai and machine learning to attribute implicit consent to a user‚Äù. So there is no longer any cookie pop ups asking for consent. They also state that a user can go into their settings and change their privacy preferences whenever they want.

I'm running Wordpress and Woocommerce, and [I found one good tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0QbsmHR7GY) but they use a plugin to do the datalayers. I'm looking to add the datalayer script myself in a GDPR plugin where my GTM script is installed, so they get loaded only with consent :)\n\nI have found a snippet like this:\n\nscript  \nwindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || \\[\\];  \ndataLayer.push({  \n'event': 'purchase',  \n});  \n/script\n\n*(\\^removed the angle brackets as I kept messing up the lines)* What lines should I add into this to correctly get the required ID and value?\n\nNote: I already used Tag Assistant and made a test purchase but I didn't have any datalayer scripts installed... I did see information about the purchase though.\n\nAlso in the video (linked earlier) I saw how the Variables should be configured in GTM, using a browser extension called Datalayer Checker to seek the \"ecommerce.value\" and \"ecommerce.transaction\\_id\". But this comes after I get the dataLayer.push-stuff in place... :D  Thank you!",

They can also have a general framework designed once and used forever of 'if the user does not accept this category group, we don't drop this tracker/script/cookie'.\n\nSuper handy when working with white labels, or other third-party tools like live chat, A/B testing, or surveying new analysis/performance tracking tools.\n\nFor a small personal site, these tools are overkill, IMO.",

Google tag manager, as example, has a way for you to record events, and get the data out -- but it's into google-centric tooling. It even has an event for cookie acceptance, if needed.\n\nYou can implement some of this yourself, but you need to either send the data to a third party service, or write something custom to injest it into your own database. One could call \"bigquery\" (where things like this wind up in Google land) your own database...

But here‚Äôs the thing: recently, I‚Äôve noticed that many cookie banners use a¬†**fade-in animation**, which not only grabs attention (as animations are supposed to), but the animation is often¬†*so slow*¬†that it just makes the banner even more irritating.\n\nI get why animations are used‚Äîthey‚Äôre designed to make users notice the banner.

That just seems natural that some level of awareness is present in society that we're all being tracked for (insert slew of purposes here) and this awareness is the baseline for action. The *control* in the browser is somewhat lacking. There needs to be more controls to allow the functionality that cookies bring without using cookies explicitly, in that we can define authentication functionality separate from other cookie usage. oAuth and Passkey are great examples of steps in the right direction. Abusing cookies just to manage authentication and state seems like it sort of? is backfiring? Anyhow.\n\nI'm going to be more explicit (unfortunately not a great user interface/experience feature) now with stating the intentions of my site's cookie usage; Essentially we just need to say, 'Hey, heads up. In order to register an account here, we need your consent to use a cookie for such a purpose'. At least until I fully implement oAuth and Passkeys. I digress.\n\nAnyone else having to deal with cookie banners, cookies in general, or just have thoughts on them?",

        "selftext": "I'm a digital nomad, all my sites are offshore and my business model isn't based in the US, UK, EU or other jurisdiction that implemented these draconian cookie popup consent laws that have killed the UI experience of the Internet since 2018. \n\nI personally hate the GDPR popups. They detract from my user experience, and I'm sure I'm not the only one that finds them annoying.\n\nIn order to give a more positive user experience with less distractions to my users, I'm thinking of not placing any cookie notification popups anywhere on my sites. What's the worse that could happen considering my sites aren't based within any jurisdiction that introduced these draconian laws? Will I be whisked away in a black jet to a private detention center?\n\nSerious insights appreciated as opposed to whether or not implementing these cookie popups is \"moral\" or not, thanks.\n\nUpdate: I just want to clarify I am vehemently against 3rd party cross-site tracking for data harvesting and advertising purposes without consent. I'm also against popups of all forms as I find them intrusive and don't wish to subjugate my users to them either. I personally don't use cookies to track my users any further than is needed for the functionality of the website they're on, and hence why I don't wish to display any annoying cookie notices. Personally I use adblockers and cookie blockers and only opt-in to cookies that I desire by myself through these extensions. When a website bothers me with additional cookie popups, it impacts my user experience negatively.\n\nUpdate 2: These cookie popups destroy the UI experience without doing anything positive because if users didn't want to give consent for cookies, they could just install an adblocker, like I do. If they want a site to use cookies, they can turn the adblocker off for that site. This is a simple solution that doesn't destroy the UI experience of the Internet. I stand by what I said: Requiring cookie consent confirmation is a terrible concoction by politicians with little thought as to how this extra action on *every single website you visit* (which often doesn't remember your selection) affects user experience. It's government overreach, plain and simple.",

It's intrusive. It doesn't make you safer online. 90% of the websites that have a GDPR notice actually have a non-compliant implementation by not providing an opt-out option for non-essential cookies (or by providing one but hiding it). This could actually hand them in more hot water than if they had no implementation at all. People can downvote me all they want but they clearly don't understand that this policy is a good idea gone awry and doesn't do anything it promises.\n\nEdit: As an aside, one of the background projects of mine is a Chromium extension that automatically hides GDPR notices. It's been a bit tricky to implement because I have to create various filters to try detecting them, and want to have options for people to create their own filters.

What I am saying is that this is a step in the right direction, where the user has a say in how their data is to be processed. Companies cannot simply track users because they want to, they need to have a specific reason for it.\n\nI'm curious, what would you want to happen?

What you miss, however, is that the \"part\" you're speaking of is the data source. It's the start of the line - the entirety of the GDPR begins with whether or not the individual from which the data originates from gives their consent for the relevant data to be used, stored, or sold in the first place. If that doesn't work technically, ethically, and practically, the entirety of the GDPR is rendered wholly ineffective. The phucking cookie popups and app privacy notices are the most common places in which this consent process takes place, and it's a total clusterphuck. It's a blind \"I agree\" that your beloved GDPR has now conditioned people to just click. The GDPR is rendered useless if the consent process is ineffective. \n\nI think the GDPR should have focused on getting browser and OS vendors to properly implement system-wide privacy settings that can be transmitted in the form of HTTP request headers (such as the DNT/GPC headers), parameters in OAuth handshakes and JWT auths, etc. that would allow for a completely unobtrusive privacy setting that can be transmitted under the hood once it has been clearly set by the user in their browser settings (or in the case of apps, their OS). Things like DNT headers already had definition, and some browsers already had settings for them. The problem is no one respected the setting. The GDPR should have required that they be honored, and expanded on the proposed DNT header standard with something like the GPC. The GPC is relatively new and is aimed at *trying* to be GDPR compliant. That type of standard should have been defined, documented, and made mandatory from the start. It wasn't mandatory because it didn't exist. It's like trying to put the cart before the horse. This is what happens when bureaucrats talk law before talking implementation.

But other people just don't. They either get lost or swindled.\n\nI hate the obfuscation, semantics thrown out the window, middle clicks and opening in new tabs being blocked, what should be a link is a button or a location.href, what shouldn't be a link... is. Hijacking history states. Unexpected, clickable crap appearing out of nowhere. Autocomplete suggestions changing or disappearing 5 milliseconds before you select them.\n\nI hate when they reinvent the wheel, when they put every single letter of a rich edit box in its separate DOM hierarchy with an entire gigantic tree structure, I hate when they can't just use normal input fields for normal, plain, basic stuff, instead choosing to go for the whatever \"framework native\" method.\n\nI hate how you can't search for specific problems AT ALL these days. If you have ANY issue that isn't the most common cookie cutter problem, then tough luck. Try searching for a problem with, for example, Chrome on your phone. You will only get answers for desktop. Or a problem with a specific car model from a specific year. Lucky if you'll even get a listicle with 10 tips for same brand of cars. **Web search is dead, beyond saving.** LLMs integrated into search only fueling the fire. I am currently having a problem with Windows 11, the taskbar sometimes gets behind maximized windows as if they were on fullscreen, it's NOT a problem with \"auto hide taskbar\", because I'm not even using that, I have to relaunch explorer.exe to fix it. But every search result points me towards that fucking option as if I'm the idiot. And that's all by design. Back in the day you actually were able to find people having the same problems as you. A couple years ago I was complaining how difficult it is to search for phrases with a negating word such as \"not\". Not using the \"-keyword\" with the minus. The preceding sentence serving as a self-referencing example. Oh how naive I was. How happy I was.\n\nI hate how the web is not even indexable, how forums have died and Discord became the king of online communities. How Discord is being used as a... fucking software distribution platform? Same with Patreon? What the fuck is even happening? Am I the insane one? Facebook actively fights indexing too, it's a wasteland.\n\nI hate when they say \"we care about your privacy\". Fuck off. That's the most condescending fake smile piece of bullshit a corporation could say.\n\nI hate enshittification and corporate greed in general. They got us all by the balls those 15 or so years ago when all of their services were oh-so-generously free and they were all operating at a loss, or rather, at a lack of substantial profit. Now they are reaping the benefits. We are the benefits. Every service is becoming worse, the quality is becoming worse, we are being sucked dry of our most intimate personal data, costs being cut left and right, good services becoming bad or discontinued, free services becoming paid, ads are being added to paid services, free services unusable because of ads. The early stages of this are happening to AI now. We are getting accustomed to free of charge AI services. OpenAI has got us by the balls right now already and they **will** reap the benefits of that sooner or later.\n\nI hate how if you are a commercial software developer who has not implemented a SaaS business model yet, you are basically throwing your money away. This reality sucks.\n\nBonus: I hate how e-mail sucks these days and how there is no good e-mail client or provider, free or not.",

All search does these days is pick the closest related trending keywords that are related to the most high traffic keyword from your query and show ads and top links for the nebulously maybe-related query it decided you _actually_ want to search.

You can get answers there, but the quality tends to be low and the site is not well maintained or moderated.\n\nI agree that google has been lacking severely when it comes to search engine quality results.

I want high quality results with spammy shit filtered out and no low quality newspapers or blog articles and way more options to refine and improve my results. Also google does not explain to newbie users at all how to effectively search - like using \"term\" to have the word term mandatory in search results or using a + between words to make sure both words are in the search results. It is crazy that a company that made their fortune via improving search (altervista was actually same quality but less marketed / pushed and abandoned after Yahoo! bought them) is so uninnovative when it comes to their core origin. Yahoo! also did not innovate at all, kept the cluttered directory style front page for years until people were fed up with it and collapsed. Google is much bigger but is on a down-slope when it comes to innovation as well.\n\nYoutube is a circle jerk and tool for absolute scam artists to promote stupidity, here you also need to use plugins to block stupid channels to keep from getting stupid, just by watching the thumbnails. I recommend BlockTube for that purpose.\n\nOverall I can concur - yes the web has become mainstream and that brings along more stupid people and content, but there is ways around it to filter out the bs.",

You can get answers there, but the quality tends to be low and the site is not well maintained or moderated.\n\nI agree that google has been lacking severely when it comes to search engine quality results. They have not been able to try to improve their search results for years. As a company they are lackluster in innovation and their customer support is non-existing, except if you spend a lot of money in Adwords.\n\nI would like to see a serious challenger improving search results. I want high quality results with spammy shit filtered out and no low quality newspapers or blog articles and way more options to refine and improve my results. Also google does not explain to newbie users at all how to effictively search - like using \"term\" to have the word term mandatory in search results or using a + between words to make sure both words are in the search results. It is crazy that a company that made their fortune via improving search (altervista was actually same quality but less marketed / pushed and abandoned after Yahoo! bought them) is so uninnovative when it comes to their core origin. Yahoo! also did not innovate at all, kept the cluttered directory style front page for years until people were fed up with it and collapsed. Google is much bigger but is on a downslope when it comes to innovation as well.\n\nYoutube is a circle jerk and tool for absolute scam artists to promote stupidity, here you also need to use plugins to block stupid channels to keep from getting stupid, just by watching the thumbnails. I recommend BlockTube for that purpose.\n\nOverall I can concur - yes the web has become mainstream and that brings along more stupid people and content, but there is ways around it to filter out the bs.",

Tracking this connection between the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address of a user would be considered personal identifyable information.\n\nAnother issue is that a users IP address can change as they are interacting with your website. What if they open your website while on a public hotspot, then move to mobile data as they lost connection. You now have an IP address inside your Google Tag Manager that is not found in your cookie consent logs.\n\nThis shows that IP addresses are not great identifiers for this\n\nYou need a token that identifies the user in both Google Tag Manager and your consent logs, while still preserving privacy",

It's been becoming an issue over time for me but I don't want to turn 'ranty' as I think most of you will share the frustration. I finally broke today because I I was browsing on my phone, then on my PC, and I've had enough. \n\nMore so because I've noticed a lot of the websites I've visited use the same consent platform, like OneTrust so I thought if I've rejected for one site using this consent platform why isn't there a way for OneTrust to remember my choice for all websites?\n\nFrom a users' perspective, do you know if there's a way to bypass, automatically dismiss or choose an option on cookie consent banners across multiple websites in a browsing session? \n\nFor context, I mostly use Chrome, Firefox and a mix of Windows, iOS & MacOS. I can handle my choice not being remembered across platforms, i.e. from mobile to desktop to laptop. But on one platform using the same browser, it'd be great if there was a way where I just wasn't prompted on every single website I visit when I'm researching something in a browser session.\n\nI've searched r/webdev and while there's a few things generally about cookie consent and people's opinions, I couldn't find anyone raising this point about the platforms themselves remembering the user's preference. The closest thing I've seen would be a browser setting but alas this isn't currently available on Chrome and Firefox to my knowledge.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Cookies are just a very tiny part of all that (only mentioned 3 times in the specs), but it became the bogeyman for the industry to focus on. The main issue in general is tracking. If this is done without using cookies, it still absolutely falls under the GDPR.\n\nAlso, these banners and modals look like they've been built either by AI or the most imcompetent developer that walked the planet. Some of the first iterations of these I saw would actually make dozens of external API calls to register you opting out (contrary to the very specific opt in behaviour the GDPR calls for) of specific groups of cookies. Those modals would take literal minutes to \"process\" your request, and most people would either leave the site or just accept everything (which conveniently was instant).\n\nThe state of play currently is a mess of unusable cookie modals, some of which require hundreds of individual clicks to fully opt out of everything (and yes, [I tested some sites and counted](https://www.ashleysheridan.co.uk/blog/Accessibility+Issues+With+Cookie+Banners) ). The result is something that is difficult for most people to use, and impossible for those people with specific accessibility needs. And a mistake I see pretty much every banner/modal make is to list the essential/functional cookies but as a readonly option that can't be changed. They're not part of tracking, they never needed to be listed or disabled, but somehow, they fell into the general misconception that GDPR = no cookies.\n\nAs the GDPR works through the various companies that violate specific sections of it, I reckon we'll see another change in how these modals are presented, but that's probably on a timescale of years.",

Quite often code was written by people that don't even work at the company anymore and trying to chase down someone to get permission to edit something is a waste of time.\n\nNow, discussing big changes with your team about parts of the code that you know others care about or are currently working on is good practice. They can give you feedback on why they did it that way and together you can come up with better ways to approach the problem. Or if you want others opinion on some idea you have or the change will impact how others work it is worth talking to others. But for smaller things or older things it is not necessary to seek permission before making any change.\n\nIf someone is just constantly making the same stylistic change to everything you do then that is a conversation you need to have with them about code style and standards. Your whole team should be working towards a single style for the code base not constantly fighting each other over it.\n\nIf someone is constantly correcting someone else's work (not just one off things) then it is time to sit down with them and have a talk.

That's what the TCF 2.0 is. Advertising consents are stored in a standardised format that the entire online advertising industry conforms to.\n\nBut we're not allowed cross-domain cookies any more, for stupid reasons.\n\nSo now each site has to set its own, and even multiple sites owned by the same network can't\\* share consent info.\n\n> so browsers can automatically set a cookie policy globally\n\n*Yes*, we *should* have this, instead of having to load the many hundreds of kilobytes of \"consent platform\" JS & associated assets on every pageview. Now that we do have, however, an industry built up of *paid-for* consent management JS bullshit, I very much doubt we'll be seeing the back of that any time soon, if ever. There's now a vested interest in keeping this horrific bullshit around.\n\nAs far as the titular assertion goes:\n\n> Cookie Consent leads to more tracking via cookies\n\nI don't believe this is the case. We only see opt-ins on our CMPs of 60-85%, and there's no way in hell 15-40% of visitors were ever clearing cookies manually with any frequency prior to all this crap.\n\n\\*Well, you *can*, depending on whether your CMP offers such a facility. The only (as far as I'm aware) decent free one left standing is QuantCast's, and they *do* allow cross-domain cookie preference setting, but I believe it's via passing data around their backend servers or some bollocks or other; too much hassle to properly investigate.",

It's not a pattern I've personally come across before, but I think it's a better UX that is more respectful of our users.\n\n**We only request cookie consent at the point the user tried to do something that requires them.**\n\nOur approach is:\n\n* Don't set any cookies, and don't ask to either. No cookie/GDPR banner required.\n* Show the user features that would require cookies, anyway.\n* If the user attempts to interact with one of those features, *that's when* we ask for the cookies we need.\n* The consent dialog highlights the type of cookie required for the feature they tried to use, but also presents the other cookie options too. The user is here now, we can give them the option to enable/disable whichever cookies they want.\n* No dark patterns in the consent dialog. Two clear buttons, Allow or Cancel, neither is more prominent than the other.\n* If the user cancels, the feature they tried to use doesn't execute/doesn't do anything. If they grant the correct cookies, whatever they were trying to do goes ahead.\n* Having granted cookies, we now don't need to ask again. The user can now use that feature uninterrupted in the future. They'll see a new modal asking for more permissions if they try to use a feature that requires another class of consent.\n\n(Obviously, this doesn't help if you want cookies all the time, because you want to track users all the time. We use privacy-respecting, cookie-less analytics instead, and enhance this with additional cookie-dependent metrics if the user grants analytics cookies.)\n\nWhat do you think of the approach? Have you seen anything like this anywhere before?",

                "body": "Ah yes, GDPR making the internet less fun for all of us =)\n\nYou mentioning Google Analytics complicates matters slightly, but since your question also covers cookie consent in general I'll first tackle the general bits and address GA at the end.\n\nWhat you need to do is to actually prevent any type of cookie being set *before* the user has consented to allow them. Keep an eye on the *Cookies* section of the *Application* tab (when using Chrome's inspector panel), you'll be amazed how many third party cookies are set just from including scripts (or ifames, looking at you *youtube-nocookie* !).\n\nYou need to the following:\n\n**First:**\n\ndefer loading Analytics and any other third party script that might set cookies until consent is given. You need to do this client side using JS. So with pseudo code:\n\n**1** IF (on page load) / WHEN at runtime) cookie is set  \n**2** THEN load 3rd party scripts  \n**3** ELSE show consent popup\n\n**1** You can set an actual cookie (which you can read through *document.cookie* which brings the benefit that this cookie is also accessible to your backend, if you need this). ~~Otherwise you can just store a value inside local storage.~~ *< not true, see comment below*\n\n**2** This is where you create script elements and attach them do your *document.head.*\n\n**3** Show a modal window that you can make as obtrusive and unobtrusive as you like\n\nThis is where I can answer whether you want to use a 3rd party cookie banner or not:\n\n*It depends* : on what you want want the user experience to be like. If you deem the site unusable unless a user provides consent, this modal must be blocking the user from seeing content (at this point you need backend to only serve content to the browser when the user has accepted the cookie as users can otherwise circumvent any client side blocking you can think of).\n\nIf you want users to browse the site with reduced content, allow selecting which cookies they are willing to accept, or be a nice person and add a button allowing them to dismiss all cookies entirely. At this point you can store in session storage (which is not a persistent cookie) that the user does not want to be bothered with consent popups for the remainder of the session (e.g. until they close the browser).\n\nDon't reinvent the wheel when there is a ready to use solution, but be aware that in one form or another this solution needs to integrate with the requirements of your site.\n\nRolling your own solution might seem cumbersome but providing you have a clear idea of how to implement it, it might not be a hassle, for instance for my personal website I use Analytics and embed media content from YouTube. I allow users to view the site without consent which shows everything but shows placeholder content where the YT embed would be. If they click the placeholder I once more show the consent modal. Upon consent all third party content is embedded. The mechanism for this are just a few lines of JS to defer loading scripts. If you have this mechanism before creating the content views of your site, it's not really hard to maintain. Doing it retroactively... well that's a different story.\n\n**Secondly:**\n\nPer regulation, you need to list the cookies and what they are used for. Nobody reads this, but you need to have this section covered by law. You can create a link to a page from the consent popup and there you can list what every cookie is and what it is used for in a ginormous table. You can steal this text from any other site (because get this, they will be using it for the same purpose) or heck, ask Chat GPT to come up with something. :)\n\n**Third:**\n\nThe EU really, really doesn't like it when PII (personally identifiable information) is stored outside of EU data centers. Google Analytics stores its data in the US. You must set the *anonymize\\_ip* flag when configuring gtag (as an IP address is considered PII). <- *Sweden, Norway and a few other countries consider this still a breach though*\n\nAlso Google fonts. Download them and host them on your site (this is legal and you can download the fonts from Google fonts directly). Because loading the font from the Google CDN ... *stores PII in the US.* So once more: really, really check that inspector panel to understand what cookies are set just from visiting the pages of your site.",

        "selftext": "(This should be a farily straightforward question, but I can't find straightforward answers to this after quite a bit of searching):\n\nWhat is every website that uses Google Analytics doing when if their users hit Reject or ignore the cookie consent altogether?\n\nAll the cookie-consent examples and boilerplates I find on the Internet seem to have Accept/Reject buttons where the Reject button does nothing.\n\nHowever, let's take the use-case of a website where cookies are necessary for it to work. Session cookies, yes I know those don't need consent. However, basics things like Google analytics and I guess even third-party login do.\n\nSo my question is, what happens if the user clicks Reject or ignores, and the website still loads analytics scripts? Is the webapp technically in non-compliance?\n\nIn that case, what is even the point of having Accept and Reject buttons? Isn't it better to just have an \"OK\" button and mention something like \"Don't use this website if you don't agree\" or so (similar to terms & conditions)?\n\nHOWEVER, I think the above is also not in GDPR compliance, with something like: \"...access to services and functionalities must not be made conditional on the consent of a user‚Ä¶ (so-called cookie walls)\" in the [guidelines](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf).\n\nSo in that case, I am wondering... what exactly do/should webapps do when a user rejects cookies? Just not load (say) analytics scripts? Wait for a cookie consent \"Accept\" before loading the script? How does this work with third-party logins (say Auth0)?\n\nAnd what should be the behavior if the user ignores the cookie consent altogeher, clicks neither Accept or Reject? Do you refrain from loading Google Analytics / Facebook pixel onto the page then? And in that case how does (should) third party login like auth0 work, if at all? (or are those exempt, being considered essential?)",

You can send this token on each service request (as part of the payload or request header). It does mean that upon each visit (where the page is loaded freshly) the client needs to login again, but your navigation should in this case just navigate within the SPA routing, meaning this ideally never happens. You could also keep it in SessionStorage so that the login is valid for as long as the browser isn't closed (but this comes with a potential security risk on shared computers).\n\nThe privacy policy should list what each cookie is used for in the context of making your application work. There is no real legalese language you need here, just providing transparency. You can find plenty of templates for this type of text, even per service/feature you're describing.\n\n**User data**\n\nCertain acts, such as GDPR make it mandatory to allow a user to access al their data and also view and delete it.

The site generally doesn't use cookies or any storage, but there is a Google ReCaptcha at the contact form to prevent bots from spamming. If I understand correctly, that means I need a GDPR consent banner as it is technically collecting user information.\n\nMy question is, is it enough to just have some sort of informative banner (\"This site uses cookies for captcha purposes\"), can it be just the one with one button (\"I agree\") or does it have to be the one where a user can pick all the options (like most bigger sites have).\n\nSorry if it's a stupid question, it's my first time dealing with it and I want to get it right.\n\nThanks!",

When people accept it, then `sessionStorage.setItem` sets the value to \"ok\", and it's possible to browse the website without the pop up.\n\nI decided to go with `sessionStorage` because it wouldn't be persistent after people stop browsing the website: just by closing the tab it will start over next time. But if people open the links in a new tab the pop up will appear again, needing the consent, of course, since I used `sessionStorage`.\n\nI decided to try `localStorage` instead, and the consent is valid for all tabs now, but I still want the consent to be gone when all the tabs or the browser window are closed. So I tried to add the windows event listener \"beforeunload\" (still don't know if should be \"unload\" instead) and make it clear the consent with `localStorage.removeItem`, and now people can browse the website in multiple tabs and restart the consent over after the window is closed, but there is an issue: if one of the opened tabs viewing the website is closed, then the consent is reset in the other tabs, since it's the local storage.\n\nWhat would be the best approach? Did I make the right decision when using `sessionStorage` or `localStorage`? I mean: what are the possible approaches in doing it? Do people use cookies for the cookie consent?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nP.S.: Should I use `localStorage` with a timestamp as the value?

According to GDPR you have first to get users' consent in order to perform any tracking, even if the service is not provided by a third part, but it is a software that runs on the origin server itself.",

There's an accceptable margin of error and you're still comparing apples to apples, that error is always present and constantly in the context of the numbers we're looking at.

Good luck!",

Sessions are stored as  some cache memory and only live for a pre-determined time. E.G. 20  minutes in Redis or some Session store. How the server knows a session  is active is some cookie or local storage that sends a hash back to the  server.

How the server knows a session is active is some cookie or local storage that sends a hash back to the  server. Once the server checks for the hash, it will see it does not exist in the cache and terminate the session. Maybe you are thinking of something else.\n\n**First, I notice that they** ***seem*** **to have a rather different understanding of the word \"session\" than what I indicated in my earlier writings**‚Äîthey appear to use it to mean \"a state of connection, at least *de jure*, between the computer and the web server\" (which will henceforth be referred to as a session *sensu Hosnium*‚Ä†), when I used it to mean \"the data making up the content of the pages themselves, including that which was inputted by the user\" (which will henceforth be referred to as a session *sensu Grandis*‚Ä†).\n\n**In particular, they seem to be implying that the presence of the latter is dependent on the former, which doesn't seem true to any real extent.** I mean, if that ***were*** true, sessions *sensu Grandis* probably wouldn't survive if a computer loses internet connection or is put to sleep for any real length of time, which they *fairly obviously do*‚ÄîI have sometimes had my laptop disconnected from the internet for more than 2 days, or closed and asleep for over a week, and its not like every single page refreshes after contact is restored (the session *sensu Grandis* ending during a communication interruption itself would be almost oxymoronic, unless the local hash program contained a script to do that if it detected a communications outage... which would be in most cases one of the most needlessly cruel UX decisions I can think of). In fact, most pages still remain perfectly functional afterwards, including me being able to interact with content and submit content that I had been working on, demonstrating either that sessions *sensu Hosnium* are much less ephemeral than they think, and/or that the maintenance of a continuous session *sensu Hosnium* is far less important to web functionality than they think, with many sites able to accept an interruption and still accept user input (including often offline input) after that interruption has passed.\n\nFurthermore, even if the retention of sessions *sensu Hosnium* was extremely important, it would still be very possible to retain that hash program for it to be constantly running in the background so you could keep a \"zombie session\" going after a tab/window has nominally been closed, and store it on the hard drive to run immediately after boot so you could return to the same session if your computer restarted over less than 20 minutes or so. It should even be possible, if more difficult, to create a VPN-like server that would spoof as your IP address and run the hash program so that your sessions remain active even if your computer is incommunicado for a very long period of time. And even if we lived in a fantasy world where malicious scripts triggered the termination of a session *sensu Grandis* with the interruption of a session *sensu Hosnium*, I don't see why it wouldn't be possible for your computer to reject said script and store a copy of the contents of the current pages (including input information) on the hard drive to, at the very least, serve as an archive and something to copy from before you need to refresh it in order to continue interacting with the webpage in a manner the server recognizes. (Or, to continue the morbid analogy I used in the impetus post, the frozen corpse of a webpage rather than a taxidermized one.)\n\n**So,** ***what is the truth?*** **Is my counterargument to his points sensical? And if what I am looking for is possible,** ***are there any implementations of it?***\n\n‚Ä†Why yes, I realize I am probably mutilating Latin. Not as badly as all the web browsers I've seen mutilate the web pages they \"restore\", however, which is generally to total unrecognizability beyond the most superficial details (that being the *initial* URL, title, and favicon).\n\n(I am also posting this on r/AskProgramming, for good measure.)",

Let's assume this is only staying inside the company and not being shared with third parties. \n\nShould that be a feature/setting for the user to allow or not? Does it require explicit consent separate from the user terms and conditions with registration?",

Then the server can read newly set cookies and include the necessary snippets of HTML that spawns the Analytics and Adverts. But the downside of this is that it's another callback to your server.\n\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions?",

        "id": "gmjwya",
        "selftext": "Hi - so I am working on a ground up redesign of a corporation's global network of sites. Each region has slightly different content needs so, while they all use the same template and code base, they are separate sites with separate domains and are managed by separate marketing teams.\n\nAs the majority of these sites are located in the EU we need to provide a robust cookie consent management solution. Specifically, their legal team has requested that we provide the ability for users to enable/disable different categories of cookies ( i.e. performance/advertising/social/etc ). Additionally they require a cookie statement page with detailed information about each cookie - it's purpose, source, expiration, etc.\n\nUnfortunately I've run into an issue where all of the existing hosted cookie consent solutions I have tested so far either don't support the desired user experience or don't support all of the languages we need.\n\nI've also considered implementing this from scratch on our own but it's very daunting. We only have a few first party cookies on the site and I can add a consent layer, categorize, and provide translation capability for those without too much trouble.\n\nHowever, the client uses Google Tag Manager (GTM) to handle third party scripts and each region is likely to use a separate selection of scripts. I've done a bit of research on how one might categorize and block these scripts and most articles I have read involve making extensive customizations within your GTM configuration. Everything about this sounds hellish to maintain when we consider that we'd be having to account for more than a dozen separate marketing teams each with their own GTM accounts.\n\nSo, unless I'm missing some easy way to interact with cookies added by GTM programmatically ( entirely possible ) it seems like using an existing SAAS solution is the way to go.\n\nDoes anyone have a recommendation for a solution that meets all of these requirements?\n\n* adheres to strict GDPR requirements\n* allows blocking cookies by category ( performance, advertising, etc )\n* capable of generating a cookie statement with detailed information about each cookie ( source, duration, purpose, etc )\n* supports the following languages - English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese\n* ALTERNATIVELY supports overriding of any text ( includes button text )\n\nIf anyone has a recommendation or can at least point me in a good direction I will be incredibly grateful!",

The user must actively perform some kind of positive indication of informed consent, and just ignoring a chunk of text is not that.\n\nThis means, then, that a small banner simply won't do the trick: users will just ignore it and keep browsing around it, and you still can't track them because they have not agreed. And you can't deny them access either, because (see above) that's not allowed. Likewise, a dismissable banner is worthless, because dismissing does not imply consent, even if (see above) the banner has text in it saying \"by continuing, you agree...\". So if you're set on getting people to allow tracking, you have to be rather obnoxious about it - as obnoxious as you can be without stepping into outright illegality. Blocking access entirely is not allowed, but a large banner that covers all the interesting stuff and has a nice inviting green \"accept all\" button, and a pale transparent \"customize\" button that takes you to a large complex page with lots of frightful semi-legalese explanations and sixty switches that you need to turn off one by one as you scroll down 12 screenfuls of dread, that's borderline acceptable, and seems to be considered the current sweet spot.",

I'd like something like this for cookies, where I can auto subscribe and get low balance notifications, or accept cookies or delete my existence on that site, etc. I'd truly rather pay 2 cents than have an annoying cookie pop up. Your info is a product, and anonymous microtransactions is also a product.",

We have an in-house privacy team which reviews those elements and then give guidance on when we need GDPR and other associated banners based on where the visitor comes from.\n\nFor example, in one of the projects I needed to capture statistics on usage for a certain feature which was available to people who were flagged for a certain experiment. However, since the beta pool was small enough that the data collected could feasibly be used to identify individuals in the pool, we had to first ask consent from the flagged users to start collecting this information. The alternative was to not tie it to the experiment subgroup but the data would have been less useful. No, we could not have deemed it an \"essential cookie\", because technically the product would function without it.\n\nDue to the complexity of GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy acts it's usually safer to always include the banner and explicitly ask for permission to log anything, and then apply scaling factors on the data provided based on estimates of how many people rejected all cookies.",

A validated email address is far more valuable.\n\nIf you want to actually get conversions & sales from email, then you need good inbox visibility to start with. This means maintaining your sending reputation. Email validation is a form of email engagement which is a +ve sender reputation signal.\n\nThis is a pretty well developed practice in (real) email Marketing Automation. Having a bunch of disengaged email recipients compounds -ve reputation signals over time and  makes sends successively less visible to the *engaged* recipients. Less engaged recipients seeing your email => less clicks => fewer conversions.\n\nBasically you stand to gain more by having a smaller, verified & active list from compounding +ve reputation signals helping to boost inboxing/visibility and email ROI over time.\n\nThe best content I know of here is by Mike Arsenault who used to do marketing at webflow.\n\nVid here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxfivFmOPAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxfivFmOPAE)  \nBlog here: [http://rejoiner.com/resources/email-deliverability/](http://rejoiner.com/resources/email-deliverability/)\n\n\\^ not associated with this guy or brand, but the email team at work does use Rejoiner as an ESP",

Only if a marketing email does not present the option to unsubscribe, is sent to someone who never signed up for it, or does not advertise a service related to one the receiver uses is it violating the GDPR.\n\nIt does not necessarily force you to use *double* opt-in. It just makes sure that your customer has given her consent ‚Äúfreely [...], specific, informed and unambiguous.‚Äù\n\nDo you know any other method to give informed consent other than a double opt-in?\n\nEDIT: An example is if you happen to have the customer on the phone anyway and ask them for consent to be included in the Newsletter.

        "selftext": "I'm making an startup that collects analytics and marketing data, [https://storyteller.so](https://storyteller.so)\n\nThe whole point of the app is to collect that data in-house, not using 3rd party tools or sending it to different providers.\n\nFrom my understanding, the fact that the app is collecting information it requires to function, and isn't using 3rd party collection, it should be compliant to both laws without the need for a bunch of \"accept cookie\" banners.\n\nIt is also my understanding that sites that prompt those annoying cookie banners aren't really complying with the law.\n\nI also don't understand the consequences of not following those laws if I'm not in  California or Europe, so I'd like to understand this and make sure I am compliant without doing needless feature work.\n\n\n\nEDIT::: So I asked chatGPT but I dont knwo if I can trust it's answer, but it seems reasonable.\n\nIf your site and app use cookies **only for essential purposes**, such as maintaining user sessions and tracking which A/B testing version a user is seeing, and you gather analytics directly on your own backend without setting additional cookies for these purposes, your GDPR and CCPA obligations may differ:\n\n# GDPR Considerations\n\n1. **Essential Cookies**: Cookies used solely to maintain sessions and ensure functionality (like tracking A/B testing variations) are generally considered \"strictly necessary.\" Under GDPR, **strictly necessary cookies do not require user consent**. However, users must still be informed about their use in a cookie policy or privacy policy.\n2. **Analytics Without Cookies**: If you gather analytics server-side without setting additional cookies, this avoids the need for consent typically associated with analytics cookies. However, GDPR still requires you to:\n   * Be transparent about data collection (e.g., in your privacy policy).\n   * Justify the data processing under a lawful basis such as **legitimate interest**.\n   * Minimize data collection to what is necessary for your stated purpose.\n3. **A/B Testing**: Tracking A/B testing versions via session cookies can qualify as strictly necessary if it is essential for delivering the service users expect (e.g., ensuring they see a consistent version of your site during a visit).\n\n# CCPA Considerations\n\n1. **Session Cookies and Analytics**: Under CCPA, session cookies used for functionality or analytics collected directly by you (not involving third-party tools) are typically not considered a sale of data. However, you must:\n   * Disclose that you collect analytics data in your privacy policy.\n   * Provide a mechanism for users to opt out of data collection if the data is considered personal information.\n2. **A/B Testing**: Similar to GDPR, if the data collected is necessary for providing the service (e.g., ensuring users experience the same A/B testing variant), it is unlikely to trigger additional obligations. Still, you should disclose it transparently.\n\n# Do You Need a Cookie Banner?\n\n* **No Cookie Banner Required**: If the cookies used are strictly necessary, and no analytics or tracking cookies are set, a cookie banner is not required under GDPR.\n* **Transparency Required**: Both GDPR and CCPA require you to explain in your privacy policy:\n   * The types of data collected (e.g., analytics data, session tracking).\n   * The purposes for which the data is processed.\n   * Users' rights (e.g., access, deletion, or opting out under CCPA).\n\n# Key Steps to Ensure Compliance\n\n1. **Privacy Policy**: Clearly state:\n   * What data is collected (e.g., session cookies, analytics data).\n   * Why it is collected and how it is used (e.g., A/B testing, site functionality).\n   * User rights (opt-out under CCPA, access, or deletion).\n2. **Avoid Non-Essential Cookies**: If you don‚Äôt use cookies for analytics or third-party tracking, this simplifies compliance significantly.\n3. **Lawful Basis**: For GDPR, rely on a lawful basis like legitimate interest for server-side analytics and strictly necessary cookies.\n\nBy sticking to these practices, you avoid the need for a cookie banner while still meeting the transparency and accountability obligations under GDPR and CCPA.",

Hope I can shine a little more light here. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything further.\n\n>Essential Cookies: Cookies used solely to maintain sessions and ensure functionality (like tracking A/B testing variations)I believe ChatGPT is giving you an incorrect definition of essential cookies here. \n\nUnless I'm misunderstanding your product, if you turn off tracking A/B testing, ***the site will still work and the user experience during that session wouldn't be impinged.*** If so, these are not essential cookies; they would rather fall under persistent cookies (aka tracking cookies). These absolutely do require informed consent, and you would need a cookie banner for this. \n\nIn general, essential cookies tend to do things like keeping someone signed in during the session or retaining their language choices. The two rules of thumb I follow are:\n\n* if the cookie doesn't expire at the end of the session, i.e. there is data left over after a person finishes a session, it's likely not essential to the session. You'll need consent.\n* If the cookie is not there to enable the user to use your site, it's not essential to the user, it's just important to you. You'll need consent.\n\n>I also don't understand the consequences of not following those laws if I'm not in California or Europe, so I'd like to understand this and make sure I am compliant without doing needless feature work.\n\nSo, it's actually not about where you are; the laws aren't protecting you, they're protecting the citizens of their region.\n\n* If you collect personal data from a citizen of the EU, you'll need to follow the rules set by the GDPR.\n* If you collect personal data from US citizens in California, you'll need to follow the CCPA / CPRA.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcing fines, that's when things become a little more technical and you'll have to do your own reading. But your service could absolutely be banned in the EU, and in my opinion that risk isn't worthwhile when compliance softwares tend to be barely a few dollars a month and, in some cases, offer lifetime licenses. \n\n>It is also my understanding that sites that prompt those annoying cookie banners aren't really complying with the law.\n\nNot exactly - if you see a site with a cookie banner, it just means they're using non-essential cookies and requesting your consent to use them. By having the banner - assuming the banner is actually compliant and blocks scripts automatically - they are simply doing their best to comply with the law.\n\nEnd of the day, your product is a tracking software and your service is now highly regulated. But it's still incredibly useful, and you'll find more than 50% of people still consent to cookies anyway. As a marketer by trade, your product looks to be in the best interest of the internet and user experience - keep at it, just don't ignore compliance(!\n\nHope this helps :)\n\nAlistair",

        "author": "KvetoslavNovak",
        "id": "1k7d88b",
        "selftext": "On Apr 23, 2025 the European Commission found that Apple breached its anti-steering obligation under the Digital Markets Act [https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text](https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text) (DMA), and that Meta breached the DMA obligation to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data.\n\nTherefore, the Commission has fined Apple and Meta with ‚Ç¨500 million and ‚Ç¨200 million respectively.\n\n**## Non-compliance decision on Apple's steering terms**\n\nUnder the DMA, **app developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able to inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store**, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases.\n\nThis duty of the gatekeeper to allow developers to link users to alternative purchase options outside the gatekeeper's platform is set out in Article 5(4) of the DMA [https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text#Article-5-Obligations-for-gatekeepers](https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text#Article-5-Obligations-for-gatekeepers)\n\nThe Commission found that Apple fails to comply with this obligation. Due to a number of restrictions imposed by Apple, **app developers cannot fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels** outside the App Store.\n\nSimilarly, consumers cannot fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers.\n\n**## Non-compliance decision on Meta's ‚Äúconsent or pay‚Äù model**\n\nUnder the DMA, gatekeepers must seek users' consent for combining their personal data between services. Those users who do not consent must have access to a less personalised but equivalent alternative.\n\nIn November 2023, Meta introduced a binary \\_Consent or Pay\\_ advertising model. Under this model, EU users of Facebook and Instagram had a choice between consenting to personal data combination for personalised advertising or **paying a monthly subscription for an ad-free service**.\n\nThe Commission found that this model is not compliant with the DMA, as it did not give users the required specific choice to opt for a service that uses less of their personal data but is otherwise equivalent to the ‚Äòpersonalised ads' service. **Meta's model also did not allow users to exercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data**.\n\nThe duty of the gatekeeper to provide users with a less personalized but equivalent alternative if they refuse data processing consent is set out in Article 5(2) of the DMA [https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text#Article-5-Obligations-for-gatekeepers](https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text#Article-5-Obligations-for-gatekeepers)\n\n  \nSource: [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip\\_25\\_1085](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085)",

I of course use Laravel on everything, like you. I prefer Laravel to Ruby on Rails, although both have their own strengths.\n\nThe main issue with PHP isn't PHP itself (although PHP prior to version 5 or 6 had a LOT of issues), it's the trash legacy code everywhere, and the amount of terrible developers who use PHP because they don't have the talent to do anything other than hack together code they probably took from Stackoverflow.\n\nRuby on Rails has a steep barrier to entry - it's hard as hell to get started in it (compared to PHP at least), and you really have to know what you're doing to set up a local dev environment. To this day, just installing Ruby on Rails and hoping it will work is a stressful experience for me, although I know there's probably easier ways to do it now like with Docker containers.\n\nI generally prefer to follow SOLID principles whenever possible, and PHP 8 and Laravel 7/8 really seem to encourage it out of the box. Definitely a lot of terrible Laravel devs too, unfortunately, who can't seem to adhere to even basic MVC rules. The average Ruby on Rails or Python dev I've come across generally seems more competent than the average PHP dev, but maybe that's just me.\n\nI still use Laravel on just about every project myself, though.",

On the other side of the isle you get people who think PHP is this just great language with no issues and everyone who criticizes are silly bcs \"8.1 features 111!!!1!\" and so on. But I have to say I prefer the later more than the former.\n\nNo, it's not bad practice at all. PHP is very fast to develop and prototype language. Which can also scale well as it's less language dependent than many beginners think, however you run into an issue or two which are language specific down the line occasionally.\n\nThat being said, it's important to recognize that often you do not need that \"scale\". And wasting your time to make something \"scalable\" when there is absolute no requirement on the horizons to make it so is a mark of a inexperienced programmer.\n\nAs to repeat what other people already said answering your question about lack of security, there is nothing innately insecure about php. At least not more than any other popular language. Insecurities are generally result of poorly written code, not the language itself. PHP due to how easy is to use the language was often used by people who did not know a lot of stuff about security measures in terms of code one has to make, couple that with amount of php websites on the internet and that's how insecurity got associated with php. That being said, you can have absolutely the same issues with Java, Python or whatever.\n\nMy point: your usage of PHP is fine. It solves the problem. Move on. Your class mate is an idiot.",

And this for a mix of reasons, including facility of handling the basics (on webmaster side. On dev side it's rather hellish to dive into, at least until you get core notions), very strong reputation, active development, being of a strong quality code (although there are still areas that would warrant some slaps in the face) and \"being designed as a framework even before a CMS\" so you can tailor it to custom use-cases from both sides.\n\nIn 5 years though it may be in the top 10 at the very best, considering how fast and wide other products progress...",

Using PHP does not appear to be an obvious competitive disadvantage.\n\n__However__.\n\nPHP is loathed. That means it is difficult to find motivated programmers who use PHP (or rather, you'll find plenty of programmers, but a large share will be less capable and less willing to learn new things or go out on a limb). Simply because of a self perpetuating cycle: PHP sucks, why? Because everybody knows it sucks and therefore everybody who uses PHP just isn't in tune or doesn't care.\n\nLanguages are a product of their community. No language stands alone. PHP (or Java, or Python, or Haskell, or Brainfuck) is no better than the community: If those answering questions (here, stackoverflow, etc) aren't very bright or motivated, that makes it harder to learn the language. If the libraries don't exist, have bad API, or are riddled with bugs, that's a problem. Hence why it's a self perpetuating prophecy.\n\nSo how bad is it in the PHP world? Not horrible, but it's definitely picking up some drag and I really, really doubt it'll get better. Languages like java do well despite common complaints, but PHP really does seem to be losing its edge.\n\nFor what it is worth:\n\n* PHP was just badly designed. It exudes incompetence everywhere. For example, its built-in function names are _wildly_ inconsistent, using underscores seemingly arbitrarily and using different synonyms. There's actually a really stupid reason for that: The original versions would hash function lookups on string length so the original designers went out of their way to make functions have a nice distribution of name length. Which is an epically stupid way to name functions, of course. This is one of a very, _very_ long list of dubious design decisions. The problem is, __all__ languages have that list, and for all languages it's a sizable list. But I'm pretty sure PHP's list is many times longer than just about any other mainstream language. See also [PHP is a fractal of bad design](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/), but note that there have been rebuttals and revisits, which may be worth a read.\n* PHP used to have a bunch of baked in advantages but all of those have gone. It must compete now just on community and language design (and I fear for both of those). In the past, the vaunted 'LAMP stack' (Linux + Apache webserver + MySQL db + PHP) was __incredibly__ cheap to find a hoster for, in very sharp contrast to just about anything else which required literally 20x or more monthly (as you could get virtual LAMP stacks, where you shared space with many others on a single server, but few hosters would let you pull that stunt for anything else, and paying for an entire server was expensive. These days, you get the entire linux server with root access as a virtual IAAS appliance for 5 bucks a month or whatnot. PHP is no longer 'cheap'). Also, the PHP model, crazy as it was, enforces that you shove ALL your state in a database, but that does actually let you scale it better. Of course, you can do that (store all state in db) in _any_ language, and these days, other languages have web frameworks that support that model, so that advantage has turned into the handcuffs that they always were.\n\nYour friend is an ass, but you should probably still be thinking 'when shall I learn a different language?'. When, not If.",

Thats just good contract hygiene. \n\nHaving said the above, I don't think it would be considered reasonable for you to know the ins and outs of regulatory compliance issues. GDPR aside, security is a shared responsibility. As a contract developer you should have a set of security best practices you follow. At least within the scope and limitations of your work, and have it included in your scope of work so the bounds are known.\n\nIf nothing in the agreement to define security scope, I would think you must negotiate and determine what you believe is reasonable. Take it as a lesson learned for next time.\n\nPersonally if I was going to do contract work, I would have a boilerplate agreement drafted, even if clients typically have their own, so I can redline with my own clauses should theirs not adequately meet my standard concerns. \n\nTake a look at something like AWS security controls.

        "author": "trolleid",
        "id": "1k4ng09",
        "selftext": "So I was reading about OAuth to learn it and have created this explanation. It's basically a few of the best I have found merged together and rewritten in big parts. I have also added a super short summary and a code example. Maybe it helps one of you :-) Here is the [repo][ref-repo].\n\n# OAuth Explained\n\n## The Basic Idea\n\nLet‚Äôs say LinkedIn wants to let users import their Google contacts.\n\nOne obvious (but terrible) option would be to just ask users to enter their Gmail email and password directly into LinkedIn. But giving away your actual login credentials to another app is a huge security risk.\n\nOAuth was designed to solve exactly this kind of problem.\n\nNote: So OAuth solves an authorization problem! Not an authentication problem. See [here][ref1] for the difference.\n\n## Super Short Summary\n\n- User clicks ‚ÄúImport Google Contacts‚Äù on LinkedIn\n- LinkedIn redirects user to Google‚Äôs OAuth consent page\n- User logs in and approves access\n- Google redirects back to LinkedIn with a one-time code\n- LinkedIn uses that code to get an access token from Google\n- LinkedIn uses the access token to call Google‚Äôs API and fetch contacts\n\n## More Detailed Summary\n\nSuppose LinkedIn wants to import a user‚Äôs contacts from their Google account.\n\n1. LinkedIn sets up a Google API account and receives a client_id and a client_secret\n   - So Google knows this client id is LinkedIn\n2. A user visits LinkedIn and clicks \"Import Google Contacts\"\n3. LinkedIn redirects the user to Google‚Äôs authorization endpoint:\n   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=12345&redirect_uri=https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback&scope=contacts\n\n- client_id is the before mentioned client id, so Google knows it's LinkedIn\n- redirect_uri is very important. It's used in step 6\n- in scope LinkedIn tells Google how much it wants to have access to, in this case the contacts of the user\n\n4. The user will have to log in at Google\n5. Google displays a consent screen: \"LinkedIn wants to access your Google contacts. Allow?\" The user clicks \"Allow\"\n6. Google generates a one-time authorization code and redirects to the URI we specified: redirect_uri. **It appends the one-time code as a URL parameter**.\n   - So the URL could be https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback?code=one_time_code_xyz\n7. Now, LinkedIn makes a server-to-server request (not a redirect) to Google‚Äôs token endpoint and receive an access token (and ideally a refresh token)\n8. **Finished**. Now LinkedIn can use this access token to access the user‚Äôs Google contacts via Google‚Äôs API\n\n---\n\n**Question:**\n_Why not just send the access token in step 6?_\n\n**Answer:** To make sure that the requester is actually LinkedIn. So far, all requests to Google have come from the user‚Äôs browser, with only the client_id identifying LinkedIn. Since the client_id isn‚Äôt secret and could be guessed by an attacker, Google can‚Äôt know for sure that it's actually LinkedIn behind this. In the next step, LinkedIn proves its identity by including the client_secret in a server-to-server request.\n\n## Security Note: Encryption\n\nOAuth 2.0 does **not** handle encryption itself. It relies on HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to secure sensitive data like the client_secret and access tokens during transmission.\n\n## Security Addendum: The state Parameter\n\nThe state parameter is critical to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. It‚Äôs a unique, random value generated by the third-party app (e.g., LinkedIn) and included in the authorization request. Google returns it unchanged in the callback. LinkedIn verifies the state matches the original to ensure the request came from the user, not an attacker.\n\n## OAuth 1.0 vs OAuth 2.0 Addendum:\n\nOAuth 1.0 required clients to cryptographically sign every request, which was more secure but also much more complicated. OAuth 2.0 made things simpler by relying on HTTPS to protect data in transit, and using bearer tokens instead of signed requests.\n\n## Code Example: OAuth 2.0 Login Implementation\n\nBelow is a standalone Node.js example using Express to handle OAuth 2.0 login with Google, storing user data in a SQLite database.\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst axios = require(\"axios\");\nconst sqlite3 = require(\"sqlite3\").verbose();\nconst crypto = require(\"crypto\");\nconst jwt = require(\"jsonwebtoken\");\nconst jwksClient = require(\"jwks-rsa\");\n\nconst app = express();\nconst db = new sqlite3.Database(\":memory:\");\n\n// Initialize database\ndb.serialize(() => {\n  db.run(\n    \"CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, email TEXT)\"\n  );\n  db.run(\n    \"CREATE TABLE federated_credentials (user_id INTEGER, provider TEXT, subject TEXT, PRIMARY KEY (provider, subject))\"\n  );\n});\n\n// Configuration\nconst CLIENT_ID = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID;\nconst CLIENT_SECRET = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET;\nconst REDIRECT_URI = \"https://example.com/oauth2/callback\";\nconst SCOPE = \"openid profile email\";\n\n// JWKS client to fetch Google's public keys\nconst jwks = jwksClient({\n  jwksUri: \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs\",\n});\n\n// Function to verify JWT\nasync function verifyIdToken(idToken) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    jwt.verify(\n      idToken,\n      (header, callback) => {\n        jwks.getSigningKey(header.kid, (err, key) => {\n          callback(null, key.getPublicKey());\n        });\n      },\n      {\n        audience: CLIENT_ID,\n        issuer: \"https://accounts.google.com\",\n      },\n      (err, decoded) => {\n        if (err) return reject(err);\n        resolve(decoded);\n      }\n    );\n  });\n}\n\n// Generate a random state for CSRF protection\napp.get(\"/login\", (req, res) => {\n  const state = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString(\"hex\");\n  req.session.state = state; // Store state in session\n  const authUrl = `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}&scope=${SCOPE}&response_type=code&state=${state}`;\n  res.redirect(authUrl);\n});\n\n// OAuth callback\napp.get(\"/oauth2/callback\", async (req, res) => {\n  const { code, state } = req.query;\n\n  // Verify state to prevent CSRF\n  if (state !== req.session.state) {\n    return res.status(403).send(\"Invalid state parameter\");\n  }\n\n  try {\n    // Exchange code for tokens\n    const tokenResponse = await axios.post(\n      \"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\",\n      {\n        code,\n        client_id: CLIENT_ID,\n        client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,\n        redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI,\n        grant_type: \"authorization_code\",\n      }\n    );\n\n    const { id_token } = tokenResponse.data;\n\n    // Verify ID token (JWT)\n    const decoded = await verifyIdToken(id_token);\n    const { sub: subject, name, email } = decoded;\n\n    // Check if user exists in federated_credentials\n    db.get(\n      \"SELECT * FROM federated_credentials WHERE provider = ? AND subject = ?\",\n      [\"https://accounts.google.com\", subject],\n      (err, cred) => {\n        if (err) return res.status(500).send(\"Database error\");\n\n        if (!cred) {\n          // New user: create account\n          db.run(\n            \"INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)\",\n            [name, email],\n            function (err) {\n              if (err) return res.status(500).send(\"Database error\");\n\n              const userId = this.lastID;\n              db.run(\n                \"INSERT INTO federated_credentials (user_id, provider, subject) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\",\n                [userId, \"https://accounts.google.com\", subject],\n                (err) => {\n                  if (err) return res.status(500).send(\"Database error\");\n                  res.send(`Logged in as ${name} (${email})`);\n                }\n              );\n            }\n          );\n        } else {\n          // Existing user: fetch and log in\n          db.get(\n            \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\",\n            [cred.user_id],\n            (err, user) => {\n              if (err || !user) return res.status(500).send(\"Database error\");\n              res.send(`Logged in as ${user.name} (${user.email})`);\n            }\n          );\n        }\n      }\n    );\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).send(\"OAuth or JWT verification error\");\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => console.log(\"Server running on port 3000\"));\n```\n\n[ref-repo]: https://github.com/LukasNiessen/oauth-explained\n[ref1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6556522/authentication-versus-authorization\n",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone! I‚Äôll pay for help.\n\nI‚Äôm in a bind. I started at a startup a couple months ago as a demand gen marketer and found that the website cookie banner wasn‚Äôt recording data so pivoted to Hubspot‚Äôs CMP. Our agency got those banners on the site but the consent tracking in GTM is a mess. \n\nI‚Äôve been implementing Consent Mode using GTM in conjunction with HubSpot‚Äôs cookie banner. Most of the integration seems to work except for one major issue that I haven‚Äôt been able to resolve:\n\nProblem:\nConsent values are getting overwritten when a user accepts cookies‚Äîeven though U.S. visitors should default to ‚Äúgranted.‚Äù Instead, the values are either not being set correctly at page load, or they‚Äôre being overwritten after a user clicks ‚ÄúAccept.‚Äù As a result, GA4 tags are firing inconsistently, and Consent Mode isn‚Äôt behaving as expected.\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far:\n\n \nSet up HubSpot CMP using their native cookie banner with separate categories for marketing, analytics, functional, etc.\nConfigured GTM with a Consent Initialization Tag to run before any other tags:\njavascript\nCopyEdit\ngtag('consent', 'default', { 'ad_storage': 'denied', 'analytics_storage': 'denied', 'functionality_storage': 'denied', 'personalization_storage': 'denied', 'security_storage': 'granted' });\nEnabled ‚ÄúRespond to Global Privacy Control‚Äù in the HubSpot banner settings to respect user browser signals.\nTested behavior in GTM Preview Mode and confirmed:\nConsent values are initially set correctly when the page loads.\nBut once a user interacts with the banner and accepts cookies, the values are being overwritten instead of updated according to category selection.\nThis happens even when no GTM tags are firing at the moment of consent.\nChecked for firing tags and no conflicting tags or triggers seem to be running when the overwrite occurs.\nConfirmed U.S. visitors should be opted in by default, per agency recommendation‚Äîbut this doesn‚Äôt appear to be happening. The defaults are still being treated as denied.\n\nQuestions:\nHas anyone else seen HubSpot CMP override Consent Mode values after interaction?\nHow can I stop consent states from being overwritten when a user accepts?\nIs there a recommended way to intercept or preserve the values during/after banner interaction?\nCould this be a sequencing issue between HubSpot and GTM tags?\n\nAny help would be hugely appreciated‚Äîthank you in advance!

The consent window shows up correctly, with the \"View profile and access media (required)\" and the \"Access and publish content\" toggles and everything, but when I hit the \"Allow\" button, I'm getting the error:\n\n`Invalid Request: Request parameters are invalid: The requested permissions are not available for this app`\n\nI couldn't actually find the new ~~permission~~ scopes anywhere in the administrator console, but it seems all the old scopes I was using are no longer available either. Anyone got an idea how to solve this?\n\nI have already upped the app API to latest version (v22) but that did not seem to work.",

I don't know why but my old app did not have Instagram in the list of available products, even after I updated the API level to v22. In the app roles I added my Instagram test users, and then went to \"API setup with Instagram business login\" and generated tokens then placed them in my testing app. I used to generate my access tokens (for the test users) from the oauth endpoint but now didn't need to do that as Instagram test users allow all scopes. Toggled on the webhooks access because I use them. I just need to remind myself to generate new tokens in 60 days and that's all. Hope this will help you!",

        "selftext": "Hi all, apologies if this isn't the proper community but just wanted to check if you may be able to assist.\n\nI recently submitted a takedown notice via Google regarding a website that had displayed my text content without consent. The basis of my claim was the statement of an individual who said that the website in question had no actual affiliation with their organization, and that my content was submitted to said website under false pretenses. Google ruled in favor of my claim and removed the content from search, although the following notice now appears on Google.\n\n*In response to a complaint we received under the*¬†[*US Digital Millennium Copyright Act*](https://www.google.com/support/answer/1386831)*, we have removed X result(s) from this page. If you wish, you may¬†read the DMCA Complaint¬†that caused the removal(s) at¬†LumenDatabase.org.*\n\nHowever, the organization in question still hasn't removed the content from their website (although it no longer appears in Google search). And upon further investigation, it looks like the website may be affiliated with the organization after all and that what the individual told me was inaccurate. My questions are:\n\n1. Will the \"In response to a complaint...\" notice ever \"fall off\" from Google Search? It's been a month now and it's still appearing. Will it be there in perpetuity or is there a time period where it no longer appears?\n2. Since the organization hasn't removed the content yet from their website, if I submit a separate DMCA notice that's not through Google and approved, will that replace the current Lumen notice that's appearing on my search results? Again Google just removed it from search but the content is still there on the website.\n3. If I wanted to retract my initial Google claim entirely based on the recent discovery the website is still affiliated with the organization, what would be the best way of doing that?\n\nHappy to expand further on this as what I provided may be too vague or confusing. Thank you.",

I don't blame them, as misinformation and FUD is everywhere!\n\n-\n\nThis is mostly wrong.\n\nThe GPDR and EU rules relate to storing and handling personally identifiable information: Information which can be used to identify you and connect you with your actions. Wether it's stored in a cookie or not is immaterial.\n\nIf the information is required to do what the person has directly required of you (i.e. they order an item on your web shop and leave behind their name and address), then you are in the green. No extra consent or legalese required. The same of course applies to information you are legally required to store.\n\nif the information is not directly required to do something the person has asked of you, but is required to do something which is beneficial to the person identified, then you might be in the green - but have to write up a text stating your reasoning.  That reasoning can be tested in court. I.e. tracking errors in your app can be reasonably argued to be allowed, as it benefits users. Access logs can also be seen as OK, depending on what they are used for. You should probably also take some measures to make sure that the storage and handling is proportional to the benefit, like anonymising logs after 30 days.\n\nIn all other cases you have to ask for explicit consent. Here  \\_all marketing and retargeting is explicitly included\\_, so that you always have to ask for explicit consent before you store someones personal information to target ads to them or resell that information. Thus a \"cookie banner\" or \"consent screen\".",

        "selftext": "edit 2/5/2024:\n\nMy sites are back online, so all is good now. My guess is that somebody at Netlify found this thread.\n\nA couple things to clarify: Netlify had every right to take down my sites after my bill went unpaid. That's not the issue. Telling me that I have to find a new service due to a phishing scam that I had no knowledge of, without allowing me to take any steps to fix it‚Äîthat's the issue. (idk why I'm even saying this... the commentors who half-read my post aren't gonna bother reading this anyway)\n\nThat phishing domain, btw, was nowhere to be found on my account once I had access again.\n\nIf I had a client that paid me regularly for 12 months and paid late on the 13th month, I would undoubtedly give them some leeway. Most humans are like this.\n\n**Here's my best guess as to what happened:** \n\nThere were 3 issues 1) there was an unrelated api error since I had changed my email on Github, linked to my account 2) there was the unpaid bill 3) the domains had broke (still not sure why). \n\nMy guess is that the support team member was overwhelmed with all the issues and did the expedient thing, which was telling me to find a new service (not unreasonable imo), and hoped the issue would go away.\n\nI didn't go away, so she brought my ticket it to a supervisor or something. He couldn't figure out the issue, so he gave me a false reason for why my account was disabled. It's fixed now, though. Thanks Hrishikesh!\n\n  \n\\---  \nI've been using  Netlify for client sites for the last 6 years.  I had about 20 sites  published on there, 8 were for clients.\n\nA  few weeks ago I received notice that I hadn't paid for my subscription  (my life was a bit hectic with moving homes and holiday season, so I  didn't notice that one of my bank accounts had gone into the red).  Because of that, Netlify had taken down some of my sites.\n\nAfter  a few weeks, I took care of the unpaid bill (definitely too long, I  know). I waited about 12 hours and contacted support to check up on it.  Several hours later they told me the sites were up.\n\nOne site was back up, but the rest weren't.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qk1kpo13skgc1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ffe1f66b1c051f17bbba70fcb4bcd77e2664d6e\n\nOn top of that, there was another issue - I couldn't log in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ffdi8eh4skgc1.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=180a11e056257464d303c2ecafb68839890f1ecf\n\n24 hours later, support sent me this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqgeloi5skgc1.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c3fb55f8c74515fed22a1d903024424c9536\n\nI've been an independent web  developer for 4 years now, and with how saturated the market is, clients  are quick to find other options for getting their website built.  Thankfully, I'm not currently dependent on this income, but the trust  I've with my current clients has definitely been damaged.\n\nI asked for further information and received:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7p3nu6t6skgc1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8d1bda14e3166f4a9922c60b12d7413ca10041c\n\nI'm entirely unfamiliar with the  website under question. I didn't receive any notice of the complaint  until after they disabled my account, and it's super frustrating that  rather than letting me do something about it, Netlify kicked me off the  platform entirely. like *I didn't even know*\n\nI  suspect that the account got hacked, or I unwisely signed up for some  AI site generator that was compromised and published a site without my  knowledge/consent, but it's so annoying that a service I've vouched for  for 4 years dropped me without warning\n\nI'm  going to look for another service now, obviously. Hopefully, it's not  too much of a headache to get my domains transferred. I just wanted to  get the story out so that people are aware. If y'all have any  suggestions for an alternative web host, lmk. Cloudflare Pages looks  pretty interesting right now.",

If you suspect the AI site generator caused this, there are a few questions.\n\nWhy aren‚Äôt your business accounts separate from personal? That‚Äôs a big red flag and poor move on your part for someone with 4 years of experience. If my personal information gets compromised, my clients shouldn‚Äôt be as well.\n\nIf you were using the AI generator on your business accounts which lead to compromise, were you trying to generate your clients sites with AI? Why play with fly by night AI generators on a business account? Poor form, those AI site generators are not that great and could be putting malicious code into your site.\n\nYour trust has been damaged and it‚Äôs not on netlify.",

        "selftext": "I hope I'm in the right place for assistance. With limited experience in website development, I recently had the opportunity to start an online store connected to my line of work. After spending time learning about WordPress, Elementor, and some basic CSS, I managed to create a functional shop using WordPress, Elementor, and WooCommerce.\n\nHowever, I‚Äôve been struggling with a persistent issue: despite high GTMetrix scores (96%+) and PageSpeed scores (99%), the site still loads slowly. Product pages can sometimes take over 6 seconds to load, and I am unsure of what to look into next. Could anyone help me understand why my pages load slowly?\n\nHere's some additional information:\n\n* **Website structure:** The site is built with WordPress, Elementor, and WooCommerce, along with a plugin provided by my supplier. This plugin powers the search functionality and displays results. Once a product is selected, the plugin adds it to WooCommerce‚Äôs ‚ÄúProducts,‚Äù and WooCommerce then displays it on the product page. I‚Äôve tested this plugin on a clean site, and it performs fast there. I have also seen other websites that are build the same way that are fast.\n* **Essential Plugins**: The site cannot function without Elementor, as the supplier's plugin does not support Gutenberg.\n* **Image Loading**: I have no control over how images are added to products‚Äîthey are automatically sourced from my supplier. There are many products, so manually optimizing images isn‚Äôt feasible. I use the Smush plugin for image optimization.\n* **Additional Optimization**: I started using Rocket CDN today, but it hasn‚Äôt noticeably improved the speed either.\n* **Plugin Count**: I have already reduced the number of plugins significantly and currently use 17 essential ones. While I could disable one or two more, this has not improved load times in tests.\n\nHere‚Äôs a list of my current plugins:\n\n* Code Snippets\n* EED SEO Add-on\n* EED WP Plugin\n* Elementor\n* Elementor Pro\n* Google for WooCommerce\n* Minimum Purchase Amount for WooCommerce\n* Quantity Field on Shop Page for WooCommerce\n* Rank Math SEO\n* Rank Math SEO PRO\n* Redis Object Cache\n* Smush\n* WooCommerce\n* WooPayments\n* WP Consent API\n* WP Rocket\n* WP Rocket | Filter the Content of the Used CSS\n\nWebsite: [https://sedora.nl](https://sedora.nl)\n\nExample of slow-loading pages:\n\n* [https://www.sedora.nl/fornuis-onderdelen/](https://www.sedora.nl/fornuis-onderdelen/)\n* [https://www.sedora.nl/koelkast-onderdelen/](https://www.sedora.nl/koelkast-onderdelen/)\n\nCould someone please help point me in the right direction for improving site speed?\n\n¬†",

They might want to be your customers but not have anything to do with Google. So they should be able to know that interacting with you means to automatically interact with Google. \n\nGDPR wants you to make this kind of information transparent and give a user the chance to agree or disagree to data gathering. \n\nIn my opinion, it‚Äôs a good thing to give people this kind of control.\n\nIf you start a project from scratch GDPR is really not that difficult to comply to. There are many GDPR compliant alternatives to Google Analytics that don‚Äôt use cookies and are more privacy conscious. Just don‚Äôt collect any personally identifiable data unless you need to and give the user a chance to agree or disagree before. That‚Äôs really the key. \n\nAlso the privacy policy doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. List the information you gather on them, list the providers that your website is using (like the hosting provider) and link to their privacy policy, tell users why you need that data that you collect, and provide a contact email so they know how they can request their data to be deleted. \n\nThere are a few more details. But if you follow some common sense basics, GDPR doesn‚Äôt even have to be an issue and you may not even need a banner.",

Embedding a YouTube video (even with the `nocookie` domain), Bandcamp, Soundcloud, GOOGLE FONTS*, etc. adds cookies. So eventually I took no chances and embed third party content using placeholders managed by JavaScript. You see a preview of \"_There is media here, but you must provide consent_\" after which a click will provide consent (if you were to ignore the banner that shows up on first visit). Once a user has consented to cookies, all third party content - embeds and GA tracking - become active. Once you set up such a mechanism, it's very easy to manage, but applying this to several years of pages containing embedded content is a drag.\n\nI'm talking mostly cookies here because those are the hardest to manage because _they are outside of your direct control_. If you store user generated content, you must go the extra mile to allow users to delete said content at any time.\n\nHowever, despite the amount of work it gives you, I don't \"mind\" GDPR, its very nice to be transparent about data collection as the internet became a wild west over the past years.\n\n_*Somebody in Austria (I think) once sued someone because their site used Google Fonts which stored a cookie on their computer. The site owner was not given a hefty fine (100 EUR I think), but it goes to show that the law is on the side of those that wish to make the effort. I just self host the fonts now._",

I see developers that make pretty enough sites that also get paid well.\n\nI'm after a single question: How can you prove the value of your website / the product you're building?\n\nI ask because as a freelance developer, I'm currently in every role. Designer, sales, client onbaording, etc. Right now, clients come to me with their ideas, I do my best to build them a working website / webapp to handle their request for some amount of money. That's my entire job and figuring out the process to make this more efficient.\n\nMy prices, quite frankly, I do pull out nowhere. I just say an amount that sounds good, or link an hourly rate to a listed estimate of each part of the website / webapp and go from there.\n\nThe reason is, in some cases the client probably also doesn't know what they're looking for, and it kind of feels like my fault if I'm messing this part up and can't actually answer why a website is valuable for a company to have. I mean like some REAL official reason. \n\nNot just like \"Because other businesses have one\" or \"because I built it and it's inherently valuable\".\n\nI feel like every website I build should have all of the works, analytics, legal / terms of service, privacy policy and cookie consent, all of that jazz. Which is in itself a LOOOT of work. \n\nI mean I\"m fine with that so long as I get paid for it lmao. But still. \n\nThat's a lot of work, but how do you really know it's valuable? Is it a risk? Do you have to prove it with analytics and metrics? Should A/B testing be involved?\n\nOr, can it just be \"good enough\" for the owner of the business / project and that's just that?",

                "body": "20 YOE here. Seriously, it is mostly made up and what you think you can get from your client. You have to read the room and know what they are willing to pay.\n\nFor example, I had one client where I knew they always had 40K left over every year.  End of year, \"use it or loose it\" type budget. If they don't spend it, they lose it next year. I knew the stakeholders well enough to know how to price because it really didn't matter to them individually. It was the company,'s money and they had a budget to blow on a vendor. So when I estimate, I'll have a fixed amount in my mind. Divide it by my rate and go from there. Obviously, I would not gouge them. But hey, $175 an hour, 3 weeks is roughly $21,000. They had a budget of $25k, I round it down to $19K and offer it as a discount. The project may take 3 weeks or it takes 2 weeks. Sometimes it could even take 4 or 5 weeks. But that was roughly the estimate we both agreed on.  \n\n\nObviously, I can't do the same for other clients. I had the same stakeholder who now moved on to another job and asked me to do some minor work and I gave a lowball quote - $2k to update their certs and run a security audit. 3 years ago, she would not have scoffed at a $40k enterprise project but now she has a new job working for a small mom-n-pop so the dynamics are different. Again, I feel out the room and leverage my relationship to extract the ceiling.\n\nI'll get downvoted for being so blunt but that is the reality of it. I am also a client and pay for whatever, because, the money wasn't mine. I have a budget and I'll use it. If that vendor has been approved and a track record, I am not going to nickle and dime negotiate. I have x amount of dollars, you want the work? I need a contract and a timeline. The rest is yours. \n\nSo yeah, it is going vary wildly in the higher enterprise space.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: 2+wks to complete a domain transfer, no way to expedite, no status updates.\n\nGoogle Domains and Namecheap have been by far, my preferred registrars for registering and managing domains. With the recent migration from Google Domains to Squarespace, I noticed one of my domains was set to expire in 30 days, so I decided to give Cloudflare a try and see how their registrar service stacked up.\n\nAfter requesting the transfer code and initiating the transfer to Cloudflare, I received an email from Squarespace informing me of a 5-day grace period if I wanted to stop and cancel the transfer. There was no way to expedite the process, which was a bit annoying but fine nonetheless. I went ahead and transferred a different domain from Namecheap to Cloudflare, and the process completed in about 5 minutes.\n\nBack to Squarespace, the 5-day grace period ended yesterday and I didn't see any updates in the Cloudflare panel nor received any confirmation that the transfer was successful. For context, my domain is set to expire on June 22nd, which is why I contacted support to get this matter resolved as quickly as possible.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpthxmst4f3d1.png?width=422&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f658f59772d68957ab9c41a6ada8c7a993d7bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dppfxmst4f3d1.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=11132528080bc60a8d7a22557bfc7157cbbfcf58\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6412nst4f3d1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5c8ab752aa91820cdec1c67e321637110ed290b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3n7emust4f3d1.png?width=419&format=png&auto=webp&s=bff9e1a9fcdbf080cd18e540881d03ede2350358\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbbj5pst4f3d1.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed04bc95720ac4845ba19db687bf98f1ac58b0a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkhefqst4f3d1.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9e8247256b34f848db272d523d04ac6d3237de\n\n[https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011719247-Domain-transfer-timing](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011719247-Domain-transfer-timing)\n\nInterestingly, for domains transferred into Squarespace, the linked article mentions: \"If you're not sure if they released your domain, you can contact them to ask. We have¬†a sample message¬†you can use.\" They provide a sample message for you to send, yet they can't expedite the process themselves when you're transferring a domain away.\n\nThere are no status or indications that there is anything going on with said domain, I have to take their word that the transfer is in progress and will be completed in the time they indicated. On the bright side, setting up with Cloudflare was straightforward, they offer great pricing, and setting up DNS records as \"DNS only\" and \"Proxied\" worked as expected.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I just built a website for the first time and I'm bumping into some last minutes issues. \n\nMy homepage displays my showreel taking the whole width and height of the screen on autoplay, the the user is prompet to scroll down with a button. I like the layout. \n\nUntil yesterday night I was using my own video of almost 100mb (yes I committed that crime I know) and then I found out it'd eat out my bandwidth and was pretty much an irresponsable move. I first tried to embed it with youtube but a few months ago they made it impossible to hide both the title of the video and the youtube logo (which really devaluates the hero for me). Therefore I moved to vimeo, but the issue now is that their js (that is necessary to run the video) is taking extremely long and is seriously slowing the loading of the homage according to google pagespeed insights. It's such a shame because vimeo has a great \"background=1&\" embed code that's really convenient. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7zxkcxeobpd1.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=b529d62fc17c14fec296bd5d509953fb860a01be\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zqmfvbxeobpd1.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c95a4670468d3a1db3e4e5979d5c1229ccb1a6a\n\nThe rest of my js is just a clickable button to copy my mail, a clickable button to show/hide a subpage of my works, and that's pretty much it. It was working fine before today so I really can't suspect anything other than vimeo. \n\nAny solutions ? Thank you",

SVG is used in this case in order to display an empty image.

Apparently there is a lot of static content hosted under [getcatcaretips.b-cdn.net](http://getcatcaretips.b-cdn.net) (bunny.net) that is not found, including scripts and images.\n\nIf I had to guess, the images contain an empty SVG as an optimization to load the page faster. As soon as the page is loaded, it is supposed to execute a script to load the actual images. But for some reason your CDN has been deactivated, so the page can't access the scripts and the actual images.\n\nHope this helps.",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI recently join a company (EU, Swedish) as they were looking to downsize and reduce cost by replacing the company which built their website.\n\nI understood the role which would basically be fullstack+db manager+security+hosting and everything in-between since I'm the only IT person in the company.\n\nAnyway since they wanted additional features on the side which involves sensitive information. The company is a web-based job search portal and makes money by hosting/posting job ads for companies.\n\nSo to entice the companies to post there and show there are candidates on the sites which they might want to hire; they are looking to extend beyond just letting people subscribe to  a weekly mail update of new jobs within the areas they have actively subscribed to.\n\nSo the new features would involve:\n1. Creating user profile page that could store; name, phone number, email and what jobs they are looking for, possible CV + personal letter.\n2. Giving option to user to:\n- Allow us to say X people are looking for jobs in the job categories that they are following\n- Perhaps some options that will let us either: A: send a email to them saying X company is looking hire people within X section, allow us to send your CV?\nB: Basically have some option that lets the company browse though job seekers and read their qualifications but not share name/profile pic/email etc \n\nSo since we are EU company we need to adhere to GDPR and I want to get advice on what we actually need to implement for compliance. I feel like all the guides online is created for 1000+ companies and not super small ones so I'm abit unclear what needs to be done.\nIf anyone can correct me/add to my list I would appreciate it so much ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nConsent:\n\nUser profile, check boxes with options for allowing us to:\n\na. Let companies know X people looking for jobs in the occupations they follow on the site.\nb. Give information about the user qualifications to company which we then can let the user know that X is interested in them.\n\nc. Send SMS/email about new job postings in the occupations they subscribe to.\nd. Send SMS/email if company is interested in them (if option B is checked)\n\nData security:\na. Ensure that the data don't leave outside of EU, we are using a few third party vendors that hosts on AWS. They are well-known so I'm hopeful they are/can GDPR compliance.\nb. Ensure data is secured by limiting access.\n\nOpt-out:\na.Creating a page for logged-in users can;\nRequest their data from us and exported to a json (xml/excel? not sure yet)\nb. Delete all the info about them, that would probably also involve deleting their details on the page (name, phone , CV etc)\n\nI'm I missing something? I feel like Creating a GDPR diary or GDPR compliance person for a 9 person company is super overkill..",

You'll also need to implement google consent mode V2 if you are using Google Analytics or other google services (such as Google ads)\n\n\n2) Yep, it's really annoying. Since we implemented the cookie popup on our sites we have a consent rate of around 80% that roughly explains the 20% visitor drop in our analytics.\n\n\n3) You could set it up only for EU. Many CMP offer this possibility. You might want to read about the CCPA if you have some visitors from California or some states such as Virginia. Those states don't require a cookie banner but some kind of opt-out form from collecting and selling data.\n\nHope that helps!",

But if I were to paste this into my browser on, say, another phone which has the app also, it of course wouldn't actually log me in on that other device.\n\n\n\nHowever. Somebody else was able to do exactly that. I'm guessing they've set up their own Facebook app to act as an intermediate & allow them to just open my link, which would redirect them into my account on the application in question using the OAuth token & \"feeding\" that response to Monopoly Go in some way. Those links looked like this:\n\n[https://m.facebook.com/login.php?next=https://m.facebook.com/privacy/consent/gdp/?params\\[app\\_id\\]=285025889266955&params\\[kid\\_directed\\_site\\]=false&params\\[logger\\_id\\]=\"8d8640ae-9538-405e-a358-a7a3591c6467\"&params\\[next\\]=\"confirm\"&params\\[redirect\\_uri\\]=\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.facebook.com\\\\/dialog\\\\/return\\\\/arbiter#origin=fbconnect:\\\\/\\\\/cct.api.prod.tophat.withbuddies.com\"&params\\[ret\\]=\"login\"&params\\[response\\_type\\]=\"token\"&params\\[return\\_scopes\\]=false&params\\[scope\\]=\\[\"user\\_friends\",\"email\",\"public\\_profile\"\\]&params\\[steps\\]={}&params\\[tp\\]=\"unspecified\"&params\\[cui\\_gk\\]=\"\\[PASS\\]:\"&params\\[is\\_limited\\_login\\_shim\\]=false&source=gdp\\_delegated&refsrc=deprecated#\\_=\\_](https://m.facebook.com/login.php?next=https://m.facebook.com/privacy/consent/gdp/?params[app_id]=285025889266955&params[kid_directed_site]=false&params[logger_id]=\"8d8640ae-9538-405e-a358-a7a3591c6467\"&params[next]=\"confirm\"&params[redirect_uri]=\"https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/dialog\\/return\\/arbiter#origin=fbconnect:\\/\\/cct.api.prod.tophat.withbuddies.com\"&params[ret]=\"login\"&params[response_type]=\"token\"&params[return_scopes]=false&params[scope]=[\"user_friends\",\"email\",\"public_profile\"]&params[steps]={}&params[tp]=\"unspecified\"&params[cui_gk]=\"[PASS]:\"&params[is_limited_login_shim]=false&source=gdp_delegated&refsrc=deprecated#_=_)\n\nThe login link that they sent \\^\n\nAnd the redirect link that I sent back, after logging in: [https://m.facebook.com/dialog/return/arbiter?protocol=https&response={\"access\\_token\":\"EAAEDOsLhrQsBOZBfpmFWclQsjbramKMlE0ocVqSYxu19PdG7B9y1OoZBoLDbEST2wAdZAHvkk6ZAESZB0gM3ykBa9FYlLM1KJwzSKZA3NwMaeFWe0hWfo7GyWgbCkgvfIc3MXrQshlDEUgZCQi2PtIwL2UlSLwBbmpDFbOyUB56FrVCtJvRtO82eaQZC3JR4kuPkQzAZD\",\"data\\_access\\_expiration\\_time\":1737736263,\"expires\\_in\":5184000}&app\\_id=285025889266955#origin=fbconnect://cct.api.prod.tophat.withbuddies.com](https://m.facebook.com/dialog/return/arbiter?protocol=https&response={\"access_token\":\"EAAEDOsLhrQsBOZBfpmFWclQsjbramKMlE0ocVqSYxu19PdG7B9y1OoZBoLDbEST2wAdZAHvkk6ZAESZB0gM3ykBa9FYlLM1KJwzSKZA3NwMaeFWe0hWfo7GyWgbCkgvfIc3MXrQshlDEUgZCQi2PtIwL2UlSLwBbmpDFbOyUB56FrVCtJvRtO82eaQZC3JR4kuPkQzAZD\",\"data_access_expiration_time\":1737736263,\"expires_in\":5184000}&app_id=285025889266955#origin=fbconnect://cct.api.prod.tophat.withbuddies.com)\n\nSo basically they skipped the whole login page by just getting me to login myself & sending them back the redirect link, but I'm unable to do that between 2 devices myself with the first 2 links I shared. It seems that they have set up their own Facebook app intermediate for this purpose, but I'm not sure since I've never developed a Facebook app.\n\n\n\nI've URL decoded each URL in the post so it is easier to comprehend.\n\nFrom what I can gather, I would assume if I am correct in my theory, the flow of the intermediate application would be something like this:\n\n\n\nme >> app >> oauth idp >> I log in >> oauth idp sends token to app >> app logs in and redirects to Monopoly Go app\\`\\`\\`",

        "selftext": "Hi. My understanding is that the trend is for consent banners, and that this trend will only grow outside the EU (even Australia may mandate it sometime down the road?).  I am looking for a Consent Mode approved Partner of Google Ads (I guess one of the approved partners at https://cmppartnerprogram.withgoogle.com/), that offers the following, in order of highest priority to lowest priority:\n\n1 - Highest Priority: A consent banner that is smaller on mobile so the user can at least see more of my landing page and hero image. The Cookiebot banner totally blocks out your entire landing page on mobile and that's annoying. The CookieYes mobile banner is better on mobile and I can at least see the top 1/4 of the landing page, although 3/4 of the landing page is covered by the banner. And on desktop, hopefully the banner blocks out as little as possible (even here, CookieYes is better than CookieBot).\n\n2 - Next Highest Priority: The banner offers a geolocation option, such that the banner is only shown to countries where legally, it must be shown.  CookieYes offers such an option for $20 per month.  This is a nice to have option, although if I can find a partner that offers a much smaller banner on mobile (and desktop) that doesn't block the landing page much, I can forgo a geolocation option. \n\nAre there any good suggestions on what partners to Google Ads that offer such a banner at a reasonable price for a small business? Free is better of course, but I am expecting to pay (ie. CookieYes's price of $20 per month is reasonable, but I hope not to go much higher than that price).",

Really it depends how good you want it to be.¬†Sure, you can add something in your server side code to every request, but that will also log make response times slower.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like those quora grifters, I also wrote my own analytics script and there is a LOT to it, even for my simple use case. A few of the considerations:\n\n- performance - I used an AJAX request onload\n- detecting bots vs real people (using JS eliminates some, but you also need to check the user agent as Googlebot executes JS now)\n- deciding on what to actually log\n- ensuring privacy (e.g. to be GDPR compliant you shouldn‚Äôt log the IP directly, I logged a hash then compared future requests to that hash)\n- how to avoid the database filling up (in my case it‚Äôs a busy site, many GB were stored within weeks)\n- how to process the data - trying to count stats from a multi-GB table is sloooow, so I have cron jobs running to process it into summary tables\n- things like admin login to see the stats, database migrations etc.",

        "selftext": "I‚Äòm writing this reddit post to share our terrible experience with Adsense and warn other developers. \n\nI‚Äôm the Co-Creator of r/OpenGuessr, an online geography game that can be played in the browser.\n\nA month ago, my friend and I created our (first) Adsense account and integrated ads into our website. As responsive ads didn‚Äôt work as intended, we had to develop our own scaling solution without any proper documentation, but that turned out to be the smallest of our concerns.\n\nRevenue for the first week was surprisingly good - However, when we wanted to receive the first payment, we ran into issues, as our account type was erroneously set to ‚Äûcompany‚Äú - Could have been my mistake. \n\nUnfortunately, according to the support pages, you cannot change the account type (even though we had never received any payment!), which is why we had to close our account and lose out on a quite significant sum.\n\nWith the account closed and a new account created, we were confident that everything would work out now, but in fact, nothing did. \n\nAt first, our account got repeatedly suspended as we allegedly had ‚Äûmultiple accounts‚Äú which was against the guidelines - which we didn‚Äôt. This happened a few times until I had the idea to change the details of your account contact, which worked to resolve this issue (but certainly is a problem on google‚Äòs side). \n\nWith that done and everything configured (again) we were eagerly waiting for our website to be verified and accepted once again. \n\nThe verification process took only, and I‚Äòm saying only as it took far longer the first time, a week but to our frustration, our website got rejected.\n\nThroughout the entire process, we messaged the support 7 times and never got a response that even answered or matched our query. My suspicion is that the are just emails being chosen automatically based on the words included in the question, which certainly upset us even more, as we spent a lot of time communicating with the ‚Äûsupport‚Äú.\n\nThis time again, the support could not tell us why our website got rejected or even addressed our issue, rather wrote about how the verification process can take a while and that we should be patient  and ensure our website is online (?). \n\nI have no idea why the website got rejected this time and it doesn‚Äôt make sense, as the same site got approved a month ago.\n\nWe always made sure to follow all policies and integrated consent management etc. in the ways that google recommends. \n\nThroughout the past month, we did not receive any money from google and had to cover all our operational costs out of our own pockets. \n\nI‚Äòm utterly disappointed by Adsense and am looking for alternatives and have contacted a few (Eozic, Snigel, Media.net) which haven‚Äòt responded for 2 weeks now. \n\nDo you guys have any recommendations or a direct contact to google?",

For an app im developing im implementing tips, that can either be one time or recurring. I think it sends a much better message out to your users when you want to protect them from an ad riddled website/game/whatever. Showing you care can result in goodwill from your users and they might feel more inclined to pay you a tip. Another option would be cosmetics people can buy. I think opt in payment strategies are much much better for the end user.\n\nEither way good luck with your game.",

Can't share a live site of mine as I've had to migrate my sites to Google Funding Choices as an interim measure, *but* it's not just me experiencing the issue: UK tabloid rag The Mirror are still using InMobi and having the exact same issues too e.g. on https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/mancity-fans-bernardo-silva-penalty-32613282.amp",

Can anyone give me feedback please, appreciate your time.\n\nI will use OAuth 2.0 to obtain user consent for accessing their Gmail accounts. This involves setting up a Google Cloud project and configuring the OAuth consent screen.\n\nI will integrate the Gmail API to fetch and interact with emails. This includes retrieving emails based on user approval.\n\nI will use Google Gemini AI to analyze and search emails based on the specified parameters then generate a detailed report with the search results.\n\nI will build a user-friendly interface using a JavaScript framework like React or next.js which will enable users to authorize the app, input search parameters, and view results.\n\nI will set up a server using Node.js or Python to handle API requests, process data, and manage user sessions securely.",

On the client side, this makes it simpler to add \"Remember Me\" functionality -you simply wouldn't issue a refresh token- and on the backend offers better user tracking for any actions taken during a specific session, offering a better security experience on both ends. \n\nIf permissions change while a user is logged in you, generally need to terminate the existing session and start a new one, which is seamless if you're using a refresh token. \n\nAt scale, it's less resource intensive to validate a session token instead of thoroughly checking credentials each time or issuing new tokens. Sessions can live in cache or in-memory databases. This makes session tokens more convenient and performant, but less secure. Having sessions expire periodically mitigates abuse of a given session token, while balancing that against having the authorization of each and every request validated by the more authoritative and permanent database.",

So in a case where a RT (original or stolen) is redeemed then as soon as the other token tries to be redeemed the security implementation would detect a mismatch, stop the session from refreshing or forking off, and invalidated the session so neither original or stolen token can be redeemed to extend it.",

        "author": "WyvernCo",
        "id": "1bomfne",
        "selftext": "Last week, when I tried to sign in to my Vultr account I was greeted with a popup demanding that I accept a new TOS to continue.  Being a completely normal person who reads TOS documents when asked to, I skimmed the new TOS to see if there was anything objectionable.\n\nUnfortunately, **the new agreement is requiring us to fork over rights to our apps/software for anything hosted on the Vultr platform**.  That goes way too far.  No other datacenter company requires this. \n\nHere is the relevant section from Vultr's new TOS:\n\n> information, text, opinions, messages, comments, audio visual works, motion pictures, photographs, animation, videos, graphics, sounds, music, software, Apps, and any other content or material that You or your end users submit, upload, post, host, store, or otherwise make available (‚ÄúMake Available‚Äù) on or through the **Services** (collectively, ‚ÄúYour Content,‚Äù ‚ÄúContent‚Äù or ‚ÄúUser Content‚Äù).\n\n> ...\n\n> You hereby grant to Vultr a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your User Content, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and otherwise use and **commercialize the User Content in any way that Vultr deems appropriate, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you** or to any third parties, for purposes of providing the Services to you.\n\nThis is NOT standard contract language for web services.  I don't know of anywhere else that requires this.\n\nFor comparison, Digital Ocean specifically limits this clause to uploads on their website (ie, for community articles, forum posts, etc), not for all hosted services (which would include virtual machines, databases, etc).  Additionally, commercialization rights are not granted and it is not perpetual:\n\nDigital Ocean TOS Excerpt:\n\n> We will periodically differentiate between our websites such as digitalocean.com (which we will refer to collectively as the ‚ÄúWebsites‚Äù) and all of our other services, such as our cloud infrastructure and other paid services (which we will refer to collectively as the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù).\n\n> ...\n\n> By providing your User Content to or via the **Websites**, you grant DigitalOcean a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels.\n\nThough requesting limited permissions for the purposes of user uploads on a forum or other community site is fairly standard, it is not reasonable for a service provider partner to require full, irrevocable commercial rights of anything hosted on their services.  That'd let Vultr take and monetize customer databases, apps, software, etc. which almost every business would likely find objectionable.  Vultr needs to restrict their request as is done elsewhere in the industry.\n\nHere is another example -- AWS does not have such broad terms, except for their generative AI product:\n\n> 50.12.7. PartyRock Apps. ‚ÄúPartyRock App‚Äù means any application created or remixed through PartyRock, including any app snapshot and all corresponding source code. By creating or remixing a PartyRock App, you hereby grant: (a) AWS and its affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to access, reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, transmit, display, perform and otherwise exploit your PartyRock App in connection with PartyRock; and (b) anyone who accesses your PartyRock App (‚ÄúPartyRock Users‚Äù), a non-exclusive license to access, reproduce, export, use, prepare derivative works based upon, transmit, and otherwise exploit your PartyRock App for any personal purpose. We may reject, remove, or disable your PartyRock App, PartyRock alias, or PartyRock account at any time for any reason with or without notice to you. You are responsible for your PartyRock Apps, PartyRock Data, and use of your PartyRock Apps, including compliance with the Policies as defined in the Agreement and applicable law. Except as provided in this Section 50.12, we obtain no rights under the Agreement to PartyRock Data or PartyRock Apps. Neither AWS, its Affiliates, nor PartyRock Users have any obligations to make any payments to you in connection with your PartyRock Apps. You will defend and indemnify AWS and its Affiliates for any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees) arising out of or in any way related to Your PartyRock Apps or your use of PartyRock. Do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in the input that you provide to create or use a PartyRock App.\n\nNote how the license grant doesn't infect the rest of AWS offerings, but is only restricted to their AI product offering \"PartyRock\".  \n\nIt's possible Vultr may want the expansive license grant in order to do AI/Machine Learning based on the data they host.  Or maybe they could mine database contents to resell PII.  Given the (perpetual!) license, there's not really any limit to what they might do.  They could even clone someone's project and sell their own rebranded version, and they'd be legally in the clear.\n\nI sent my objection to Vultr support, but I've just been getting the run around so far.  I've been trying to get them to at least let me access my account without agreeing to the new TOS so I can migrate out to another provider, but I'm now on day 5 of being locked out with no end in sight.  Migrating all my servers and DNS without being able to login to my account is going to be both a headache and error prone.  I feel like they're holding my business hostage and extorting me into accepting a license I would never consent to under duress.  I'm self employed and the product I host (currently) on Vultr is what pays my rent, so not being able to manage it is a pretty serious concern for me.\n\nAnyway, I don't know what Vultr's plans are, but I think it's definitely worth pushing back on this overly expansive license grant they're giving to themselves.  If Vultr gets away with it, other hosts may try to sneak it into their contracts, too",

Instead, it works based on your browser's javascript capabilities, so even low-end devices should work.\n\nHere are some features of the app:\n\n* Secure messaging: Your messages are encrypted, making them more secure.\n* File sharing: Easily share files using WebRTC technology and QR codes.\n* Voice and video calls: Connect with others through voice and video calls.\n* Shared virtual space: Explore a shared mixed-reality space, similar to a metaverse.\n* Image board: Browse and share images in a scrollable format, similar to Instagram.\n\nYour security is a top priority. Here's how the app keeps you safe:\n\n* Decentralized authentication: No central server is required for login, making it harder for anyone to gain unauthorized access.\n* Unique IDs: Your ID is cryptographically random, adding an extra layer of security.\n* End-to-end encryption: Your messages are encrypted from your device to the recipient's device, ensuring only you and the recipient can read them.\n* Local data storage: Your data is stored only on your device, not on any external servers.\n* Self-hostable: You have the option to host the app on your own server if you prefer.\n\nThe app is still in the early stages and I'm exploring what's possible with this technology. I'd love to hear your feedback on the idea and the current state of the app. If you have any feature requests or ideas, I'm all ears in the comments below!\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\n* The app: [chat.positive-intentions.com](http://chat.positive-intentions.com/)\n* More information about the app: [positive-intentions.com](http://positive-intentions.com/)\n* Follow the subreddit to keep updated about the app: [r/positive\\_intentions](https://www.reddit.com/r/positive_intentions/)\n\nNote 1: As a solo-developer, i dont have the capacity or knowlege to do anything like an \"official launch\". i expect the app will progressively get better with feedback from users (as it has so far).\n\nNote 2: I think the app has (approximately?) reached a feature-complete state, but i'm not sure. I'm looking for feedback on what features are missing, and what features are not needed. The next step would be to grow the number of users by making the app more user-friendly and easier to use. (I need your help on this)\n\nNote 3: The app is not open source yet (sorry), but im open to answering questions about how the code is working (more details can be found in the docs). Open sourcing the app is something i would like to do in the future, but not a priority right now. Some parts of the app are open source.\n\nNote 4: The UI is a clunky implementation of Material-UI. It's something i will fix as i move towards open sourcing the UI components. i will take the opportunity to also give more attention to a \"desktop friendly UI\" (right now the app is best experienced on a mobile device).\n\nNote 5: Id like to keep the wording i have for \"pods\" although i have recieved feedback about it not being clear what it means. A pod is what you might think of as like a \"chat room\" and will be further developed to support group-chat. you can create a pod with a connected peer in the contact-details-page. The wording \"pod\" comes from how a group of whales is called a pod.",

Like, activate it and then look at the analytics pages in Cloudflare. No API integration required.

Anything further down will be subject to the caching rules you have set up and may not track every visitor. \n\nIf you are confident that no HTML requests are cached and you use node as your server, you can use google‚Äôs universal analytics.

        "author": "Jeff-IT",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone. \n\nSo i have been freelancing for about 4 years now. I got my first client 3 years ago charging $25/hr. \n\nFast forward to today, I am making $45/hr with the same client. \n\nI'm wondering if I should be charging more, have a monthly flat rate? What would you guys do and how would you approach this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some background**\n\n1. Client has never failed to pay me, and has basically never been late. \n2. 3 years ago he ran his company in excel documents. I basically created a site that allowed people to upload data, and then it verified and processed the data. Verified data does a bunch of checks with 3rd party apis, then gets sent to other people on his team. There is a bit more to it than that, but thats the jist of it.  \n3. He told me I have saved over 100 hours of manual labor per week for him and his team. There is a lot of automation and webhooks on the site that handle a lot of the stuff they use to do manually. \n4. I'm pretty weak on server knowledge, I use Laravel Forge to handle most of that. \n5. I handle all the support. Support with bugs, support with teams messing something up, support with helping the teams use something new, etc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New Stuff he wants** \n\nI bring this up because he now wants to integrate his company banking into the platform. Using the banks api to create, manage, track transactions and invoices. Along with reports, etc. \n\nHiring other developers to work under me, to handle the smaller work loads. With me reviewing their work before putting it in production\n\nTheres a few more things he wants, but thats the jist of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of my friends mentioned I should be asking for a lot more. Since I am basically running all the code, keeping it up to date, handling all the support, handling the servers, etc. I'm not sure, so I am wondering what some of you guys do. I am a firm believer of \"your rate is your rate\" and every time I have asked for an increase in my hourly, its gone up. \n\nBut I also don't know if charging a minimum fee everything month is a good idea? Increasing the hourly rate? What do you guys think? What do you typically do?",

And vary again for salary work.\n\n**Options:**\n\n* **Raise hourly rate**: Research market rates and adjust yours accordingly. This is a good way to do it, BUT you don't want your client watching your clock.\n* **Monthly retainer**: Charge a retainer for ongoing support and maintenance. (check out the [https://www.designjoy.co/#pricinggrid](https://www.designjoy.co/#pricinggrid) model for retainer pricing.)\n* **Project-based pricing**: Charge separate fees for new features like banking integration.\n\n**Talk with your client:**\n\n* **Focus on value:** You saved him time, headaches, and wasted energy. All of which he can use to put into his company.\n* **Focus on ROI:** This is similar to value, but more specific based on the cost of previous work related to the ROI the client received from the app you built him.\n* **Focus on the relationship:** You enjoy working with him. You want to continue working with him. This relationship is beneficial to both of you.\n\n**Other resources:**\n\n* **JS Chimp** \\- [https://jschimp.com/developers](https://jschimp.com/developers) \\- create a profile. be seen by companies.\n* **Contract companies** \\- (Toptal, Gun‚Ä¢io, etc) - if accepted they will send you work and you can test out market rates.\n* **Levels** \\- [https://www.levels.fyi/](https://www.levels.fyi/) \\- find related market rates.

The [Wide Angle Analytics](https://wideangle.co) is built and hosted in the EU (Germany/France) on EU Cloud. No transfer outside the EU. We invested in a GDPR audit and have a professional DPO. Everything is secured and encrypted (we can't encrypt data in-use for obvious reasons, but we encrypt even local traffic between servers).\n\nBecause we did this extra leg work, we offer the ability to process Personal Data. You don't have to use this feature. You can deploy WAA without cookie banner and be compliant, but should you wish to process more, we are ready to support you in a compliant manner. \n\n\nTL;DR deploy Wide Angle Analytics, without Cookie Banner, with custom domain and get much more accurate and reliable view of your website traffic.",

Also, do I need to store responses to the cookie banner, like when they accept I'd need to make sure the cookie banner doesn't keep coming back and save their preference or acknowledgement? I don't have any form of storage like a database for this, as this is a purely front-end build at the minute. Do I need to implement a back-end database and API to store these responses?\n\nIt all seems a little over the top for what I am trying to do - I understand that data protection and privacy is important, but I am not attempting to store any cookies.\n\nAny assistance or pointing in the right direction would be ideal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers!  \n",

What do I have to do/what consent do I need to be able to send this data to **Sentry**?\n\nCan anyone with experience in this area provide some guidance?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I'm using CookieBot if that helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you very much!",

        "author": "CalmWeeaboo",
        "id": "14tnnmm",
        "selftext": "I am very new to OAuth so there's a lot of holes in my knowledge.\n\nI have this POC system where a node express server would provide users a URL that they're supposed to visit on their mobile phone browsers where they would consent with their Google accounts resulting in an auth code that the node express server then exchanges for access/refresh tokens (Authorization code flow using Google OAuth 2.0).\n\nMy question is, would it be acceptable if these tokens are then passed and used by a separate device (not the mobile device that the user used to consent) so that said device can include the tokens in its HTTP request headers and make authenticated calls to some protected API?\n\nThe way the node express server would \"pass\" it to the separate device is by having the device poll the server while the user goes through the consenting/authorization process on their mobile phone's browser.\n\n**Why am I doing this?**\n\nI have a device that has limited UI capabilities (it doesn't have a browser) that I want to be able to call [Google's Device Access APIs](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access) from.\n\nIt needs to be able to allow users to consent with their Google accounts using Google's OAuth, but since it does not have a browser, its options of doing that are limited. **I understand that OAuth has the Device Authorization flow for these cases** [but the API scope that my device needs to use is not supported if authenticating via Device Flow on Google's OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/limited-input-device#allowedscopes).\n\nSo I've devised this system that mimics the device authorization flow using a node express server and the authorization code flow to allow the user to consent using their mobile phone's browser instead.\n\nMy main concern is that this system could be ignoring OAuth best practices or could be outright misusing the protocol. Again I'm new to OAuth. I'm not even sure what would be considered the OAuth client in this system because while the node express server is the one exchanging the auth code for tokens, it's ultimately not the one that would consume them.\n\nNote: My system also uses user/device code pairs to identify each \"linking\" session.\n\nAny thoughts?",

The advice on forums and blogs included all sorts of random timing delays and scroll or interaction event triggers - way too complicated for something so trivial IMO.\n\nAdding to that, dealing with GDPR consent pop ups. I‚Äôve used cookie-bot and a few others, but also adds to the page delay because you have to load their scripts too. \n\nI stumbled across Cloudflare Zaraz - and although it‚Äôs only in beta, it‚Äôs super useful. Basically, instead of putting the JS in your headers, you can offload 3rd party scrips to their cloud, and injecting the scripts without interfering with load speeds. The interface is a more simple version of google tag manager, a little rough around the edges.\n\nIt also comes with a consent manager that you can use to inject a pop up, quite rudimentary and requires a little CSS to make it look a little more on brand ‚Äî but overall, very impressive platform. Page speed is now 100% across mobile and desktop, whereas before Zaraz, I had 83% on mobile.\n\nIt does make it easier if you are proxied through Cloudflare on DNS, I use the Pages hosting so integration is dead simple ‚Äî however, they do support manual loading outside of Cloudflare too (see docs link below).Hope this helps, because I know how much we all love dealing with cookies.\n\nHere is a link to the docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/",

So it is not feasible to assume that you must only enforce it on European IP's. Additionally, if you do any business with California, they have a very similar set of restrictions known as CCPA. So both of those need to be considered.\n\nIt's worth noting that the modal is not the critical part. It is part of the implementation, but just as important is developing a notice to your customers of what cookies you drop, a system for adding any new cookie based apps where they are categorized and declared, and also allowing for right to deletion. And in right to deletion, you need to have a posted policy of how to request that a user's data be entirely removed from all of your systems.\n\nAll that being said - there shouldn't really be a lot of organizational ambiguity over this. If you are not past a certain size - say a dozen or more employees - I think the likelihood that you will get in a lot of trouble is minimal. \n\nRegardless of the law - data privacy is a big deal and worth taking very seriously. The data we are legally allowed to have and what we are allowed to do with it is wildly immoral and problematic. The GDPR is not enough, but it is maybe worth embracing as a step in the right direction. If we don't start allowing real legislation in this space, the dystopian nightmare we are helping to shape is going to just spin further and further out of control. So maybe just add the popup.",

Hell no you don't unless the user consented.\n\nYou don't need a modal for that right after the page loaded, but then you need to postpone loading any external stuff until the user consented. For embedding content it can be done [the way Borlabs Cookie does it](https://borlabs.io/borlabs-cookie/iframe-demo/). But please remember that you still have to implement a way for users to change their consent later on (which brings the modal back in). \n\nBut yeah if you have anything like a font being loaded from google (or even a css snippet from myFonts.com that counts how often your font was loaded for license reasons) then you still have to use the modal and only load the font after they consented.",

But **I can't know this in advance**, because I don't know which Google account the user is going to pick before they actually logged in.\n\nIf there was only one single Google account they could log in with, I could just check if the **refresh token in local storage is null** and I would know that I needed to show the consent prompt again (to get a new refresh token).

Modularity allows any project to adopt one or more of these principles to **increase the accuracy, fairness, and transparency** of each individual's role in **collaboration**. \n\n# [Read on Github](https://github.com/dougbutner/web-4)\n\nWeb 4 is **built on top of web 3** (it's blockchain-based) while being **fundamentally different** and providing enough **benefit to society** warrant the new title of web 4. \n\nIn essence, web 4 is **positive attention catalyzer**, built on providing power to every that only gains meaning when they give it freely to another. This power is also freely given, and limited by time. \n\n> Web 4 combines real-world components like time and geography with existing blockchain technology.\n\nIn this manifesto, I will define each of the **components** of web 4, provide **psudeocode** to illustrate the minimum integration into web 2/3, introduce the **benefits to society**, and offer a **roadmap** to adopting these concepts.\n\n# Background\n\nBefore we detail web 4, we must look briefly at the concepts of web 1, web 2, and web 3. \n\n - **Web 1**\n**Static web**. Files are served from a remote server to a user's browser.\n\n - **Web 2**\n**Dynamic web**. Web pages take a user's information and desires into account to build a unique experience for them. Asynchronous requests allow single page applications to thrive. Applications are still served from a central server.\n\n - **Web 3**\n**Decentralized web**. Applications, often open-source, exist in distributed networks instead of a central server. This unfederated model trades control and censorship ability for freedom and autonomy. \n\n - **Web 4**\n**Democratic web**. Time-limited cryptographic tokens are given to each individual, and used as a measure of opinion or desire in collaborative systems.\n\nToday, the top 100 websites by traffic are [all](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) web 2 websites. The web 2 paradigm fits closely with the wider environment of **corporate-owned information.** \n\nAs more and more individuals and societies are reconsidering the place of **government, censorship, centralization and federated power**, web 3 has emerged as a powerful, provable option to shape the evolution of society on planet Earth. \n\nA growing portion of web 2 websites and applications today have elements of web 3, like [cryptoblogs](https://peakd.com) and [games](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings/category/games). While web 2 and web 3 can operate independently, web 3 enhances the abilities of web 2. Similarly, web 3 and web 4 can operate independently, but it makes the most sense for web 4 to be built on blockchain tech to gain the benefits of reliability and transparency. \n\n## Guiding Philosophy\nWeb 4 seeks to implement [biomimetic](https://biomimicry.org/what-is-biomimicry/) systems in **harmony with the universe itself** by replicating nature: the **abundance** of the Sun, rising **entropy**, and the **equality** of each human being. \n\nI believe when we create information systems in **harmonic resonance** with natural systems, our society will be able to advance more rapidly than ever before, as we will be able to **synchronize energetically** with the larger systems of information processing around us (the Earth, Sun, and Galactic core). \n\n\n## Defining Web 4\nWeb 4 introduces **four modular components** for **provably democratic systems** built on top of web 3's open-source decentralized networks. \n\n### There are four conceptual underpinnings (modules) of web 4\n\n 1. **Time-issued cryptocurrency** \n\t Individuals may receive \"Time Tokens\" at given intervals, but never more frequently, and can't hold another's time tokens.\n 2. **Proof of Individuality**\n\t Biometric Secrets, Social Verification, Proof of Liveness, etc\n 3. **Pseudonymity and Information Entropy**\n\t Information degradation over time, pseudo accounts in sensitive systems\n 4. **Harmonic GeoSocial Systems**\n\t Fair, transparent collaboration through accounting the opinions and desires of participants\n\nEach module can be used separately or in tandem. This paper invites you to involve any of these ideas into your current and future projects. We will discuss these concepts one at a time, but first let's examine why we need them in the first place. \n\n\n# Why we can't have Provable democracy with web 3\n> Provable democracy cannot be fully achieved in web 3 itself because there is intentionally no limit over how many accounts a user may control.\n\nDemocracy is essentially reaching a consensus with the idea that **each person is equal** in their influence on that consensus within defined bounds.\n\nMany different consensus models have been developed in web 3, most notably, [proof of work](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work) (**POW**), [proof of stake](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake) (**POS**), and [delegated proof of stake ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/delegated-proof-of-stake-explained)(**DPOS**). These paradigms of consensus are used primarily to determine which chain of transaction records (blocks) is considered valid, \"securing\" a blockchain. \n\nPOS and DPOS is additionally used to in projects like [**Hive**](https://peakd.com) to allow users to \"vote\" on valuable content, an early example of the democratic web. DPOS is also used for networks to determine who can access network resources, such as in [EOSIO blockchains](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md).\n\nHowever, both of these POS/DPOS use cases (curation and resource allocation) are not democratic in the sense that **each account is not equal**. In both cases, the root of democracy is in the token, not the individual, and the ownership of tokens determines the voting power or computing power held by an individual. \n\nIn the end, the only way to implement true democracy in any system is through giving **each individual equal power**. The only way to do this while keeping web3's decentralized nature is to implement the technological (biosecrets) and idealogical (time tokens) advancements needed to be sure an account is owned by **one individual**, and that individual has **only one account**. These advancements  are, for simplicity and communication, called web 4. \n\n___\n# **<center>**1**</center>**\n\n___\n\n\n# Time-issued cryptocurrency (Time Tokens) \n\nTime tokens may be distributed to users' wallets periodically as time passes, or offered to be claimed manually. They work by hashing a unique personal identifier (address) with a time identifier, linking each token to a **person and a span of time**.\n\nThese tokens provide the user with a function or action. The action burns the token, which may cause some change in the state of a system, minting of another token, or any other action. \n\n## The Gears of Time Tokens\n\nTime tokens rely on the following concepts:\n\n 1. **Time Unit**\nA time unit MUST be a superset of a timestamp. This means that a time unit is some amount (or fraction) of seconds. Each time token MUST be the only one in existence stamped with a particular time unit for each user (wallet). Thus, each time token is unique and semi-fungible.\n 2. **Time Token Faucet**\nA time faucet offers any verified user EXACTLY one time token per unit of time passed since their last faucet. This can be an active faucet; requiring some action by the recipient, or a passive faucet; automatically sending the cryptocurrency to the user.\n 3. **Verified Recipients**\nRecipients of the system MUST be verified to be an actual human in order to receive time tokens. \n\nFor a full description of Time Tokens, visit the  [Time Token repository](https://github.com/dougbutner/time-token). \n\n\n## How do Time Tokens work?\nTime tokens store a time unit (integer) with a unique user identifier (string) in a hash signed by the user's biocryptographic signature.\n\nTime tokens are platform independent, and need only store simple data involving time unit and an account identifier at the most bare level.\n\nHere is the minimum information stored in a time token, using [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction/) as an example\n```\n{\n  \"header\": {\n    \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n    \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n  },\n  \"payoadData\": {\n    \"time-unit\": 294957,\n    \"userid\": \"7f3e873a2c3d\"\n  }\n}\n```\nBelow is a brief pseudocode example of how one could use a signed time token as a JWT.\n\nSee Appendix A for more detailed pseudocode of a time token. \n```\nconst passedBioData = {..} // biodata from user\n\nconst header = {\n        \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n        \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n      }\n\nconst payloadData = {\n\t\"time-unit\": \"294957\", \n\t\"userid\": \"7f3e873a2c3d\", \n\t\"appData\": {\n\t\t\"gold\": 479,\n\t\t\"honey\": 23,\n\t\t\"axe\": 0 \n\t}\n}\n\nconst bioSecret = bioKeyGenerator(passedBioData); // Biometric provider's key or one generated direcly by user\n\n// --- Here we have the signature, to be used for any purpose --- \\\\\nsignature = HMACSHA256(\n\tbase64UrlEncode(header) + \".\"+\n\tbase64UrlEncode(payloadData), \n\tbioSecret\n)\n\n\nfunction bioKeyGenerator(bioData){\n\t// Function takes data in the form of user input into their browser or smartphone.\n\t// Data is normalized (explained in Appendix A, not shown here)\n\tbioSecretChecked = bioData;\n\t// Return biosecret \n\treturn sha256(bioSecretChecked)\n}\n\n\n```\nThe notable parts here are the `time-unit` and `userid` in the payload, and the `bioSecret` which is generated by a user's biometric data.\n\nWe have said we web 4 is based on web 3 (blockchain), but this example intentionally used  **web 2 technology**, so the ability to do it is at all begs the question:\n\n\n## Why can't web 2 be used for Time Tokens?\n\nOf course it can! It's just not viable to fulfill all principles of web 4, but can be done to an extent. \n\nWeb 2 is not a viable candidate for **provable democracy** because the federated nature means that your biometric data **must be trusted** to a third party, possibly a government, large corporation or malicious actor. Time tokens do not rely on blockchain technology, but benefit from it to remove trust and add transparency. \n\n___\n# **<center>**2**</center>**\n\n___\n\n# **Proof of Individuality - Biometric Secrets + Protecting Identity**\n> **Please Note:** There are solutions available today (like [FaceTec](https://www.facetec.com/)) that solve the same issues presented here. This paper seeks to outline a \"better\" system (decentralized + open source) that can be ran without a centralized actor, while not providing specifics to accomplish these goals.\n\n**Biometric secrets** are akin to any cryptographic secret key, they are a hash of information. The information hashed in a biometric secret comes from a person's biometric expression. In today's biometric space, static images are most commonly used for things like fingerprint and facial recognition, and geometry is the means to compare this data. \n\nBiometric secrets generated from static images are not secure, as static images can be faked. [2] Video offers a better solution to this problem, as it is harder to fake, can include audio, and lets developers create a whole new set of algorithms based on a changing stream of data. [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/) is one company using video for biometric verification. \n\n### What is used to generate a biosecret?\nThis stream of data (video + audio biometric expression) could be a user doing a series of hand gestures, singing a part of a song, speaking a phrase, speaking a phrase in different voices, clapping, making a series of facial expressions or movements, or anything else one can imagine.\n\nFor security, biometric expressions must be unique (for example, which combination of words to speak) and many types (gesture, singing, clapping) must be available and used in combination. If each person's biometric secret was generated from the same single biometric expression, it would be a matter of time before specific AI could be developed to deepfake it for anyone. If the user is the only one that knows their biometric expressions it becomes nearly impossible to guess the type and nature of the expression, and even if that is known, difficult to use the same technique on more than one account. The nature of the uniqueness could be chosen by the user, or generated at random from the biosecret software which would prompt the user to complete an action in a specific way. \n\n## Why do we need this, again?\nDemocratic systems certainly are being built without biometric verification, and will continue to be until suitable biometric technology develops along the open source, client-side requirements. For now, **decentralized solutions** like [Civic](https://www.civic.com/), and centralized tech like [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/FaceTec_3D_Face_Matching_Whitepaper.pdf) provide the necessary individuality at the cost of trust and requirement of citizenship. As different projects implement web 4 in their own ways, the ideas presented thus far will develop as flaws are found. \n\nWe will present the ideas that are crucial for this system to be different, and represent true growth into web 4.\n\n\n**Key Aspects** \n1. **Biometric Expression**: A user is presented with a choice of different biometric options used to generate a hash that can only belong to this person. \nUser can choose to either perform a chosen biometric task to receive their hashed biosecret (trustless) or generate it at any time from a third-party provider (trust). Any third-party provider will generate the same hash by a set of open-source algorithms. \n\n2. **Biosecret Generation**: User's sensitive biological information and generated algorithmic results are destroyed (made impossible to reconstruct) at the layer of hashing, and data not stored in any way, public or private, as the user runs the software on their local machine (assuming they choose the open-source software, not a third party).\n\nThe biggest issue with biometrics is the lack of trust, mostly due to the growing number of facial recognition softwares and databases. The lack of trust is almost always associated with an individual's lack of consent, not the technology itself. \n\n### To alleviate the trust issue, solutions must be: \n1) open-source\n2) ran entirely on the individual's hardware (client-side), and \n3) not expose any biometric data to any other users or the system itself. \n\nThere will always be **security concerns** with biometrics. For example, if a user uses their biometric secret to unlock their mobile device, another app could be secretly recording the camera in the background. A person could record them doing their secret, and try to play that video back to the camera to gain access. Also, *[deepfakes.](https://github.com/aerophile/awesome-deepfakes)* exist. These concerns must be addressed before this module of web 4 reaches mass adoption. \n\nThe upside of biometric secrets is they **cannot be lost**, and the account will always be recoverable by the individual. In a web 4 ecosystem, where the tokens are distributed daily and often spent daily, a hack would be much less catastrophic. The attacker will be able to access the user's balance, but not alter the past transactions, nor continue to collect the future deposits, because the real user will (in theory) quickly recover the account and change the biometric secret generation means so that the hacker's biofake is no longer working. \n\n___\n# <center>**3**</center>\n\n___\n\n## Degradation of Information\nWeb 3 focuses on storing information forever in a provable way. Web 4 introduces a **counter-model** which may be **optionally** adopted by any time-token-based system. In this model, who did what becomes **harder and harder to know** the more time that passes. \n\nThis idea hinges upon incremental time units, the number of which is used to decide how difficult information about a particular individual is to access. \n\nWith **pseudonymity**, it is difficult, but not impossible, to piece together a story about an individual user by knowing they are responsible for a set of transactions over time. The further back in time a transaction is, the **harder** it is to link it to another transaction with any **certainty**. \n\n## Degradation of Information Fidelity\nInformation fidelity requirements can also be degraded over time. For example, when generating a users biosecret, it can be assumed that the more time that passes, the more the bioinformation of the individual will change. \n\n## Degradation of Biosecrets\n**Biosecrets** are generated from a **range of biometric values**. This range of values can be expanded over time. The effect is, instead of having one hashed biosecret for eternity, the generation process will create a set of biosecrets from an increasingly **wide range of data**. This concept may be needed to keep people in control of their accounts as they age. There is considerable work to be done to develop this concept, as each data type has its own complications. \n\nIn this case, as time goes on, someone attempting to prove their individuality would have to spend a lot **more effort** to run the algorithms against their collected biodata, and the data **precision** needed to match the person's identity is actually **lower**. This is one example of **fidelity change**; others can make it more expensive to change a record from the past, make it harder to find out the ID of a voter, or even limit a past state's effect on the future of a blockchain. \n\n## Proceed with Caution \nWhile the inclusion of this concept into web 4 may seem **unnecessary** at the moment, it is another guarantee of the privacy that is needed for many **social applications**. Philosophically, degradation of information also fits in with the general web 4 desire to reflect [systems in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics). \n\nBefore moving on, I do wish to stress the modularity of web 4, and that this (perhaps the most radical idea presented) is not going to fit into every web 4 system, nor should it. This idea will find its usefulness when it is time, and should NOT be adopted without clear reasoning. \n\n\n___\n# <center>4</center>\n\n___\n# Geo-Social Harmonic Layers\n\nCollaborative social environments are always happening everywhere humans live. Currently, we are both realizing the vast amount of ways to live abundantly, as well as deciding what direction we should be facing to grow as a society. Human growth in the past few centuries has been focused on technological improvements rather than social improvements. [3] To harness the power of the information age for the collaboration of humans, web 4 will be used to enhance, introduce, and replace current structures that organize our societies, which we term geo-social layers. \n\n> Web 4 proposes that systems based in time token are the most apt to create and improve existing social layers. \n\n## What is a Geo-Social Layer?\n\nA geo-social layer is something that affects **people** (social) at a given **location** (Geo). A simple example is the governing body of an area, including all of the legislation. Another example is the customs and culture of a group of people. \n\nThe geo-social layers apt to be improved by web 4 are those which involve **people collaborating**; government/legislation, food and water management, community projects, education, events, charities, environmental protection and much more. \n\n## Geographic Stratification  \nAcross the globe, one geopolitical pattern seems to emerge. Cities are within Counties, are within Districts (States in the USA), are within nations, are within the world. \n\n1. Cities (aka Towns, Commonwealths, etc.)\n2. Counties (aka Divisions\n3. Districts (aka States, Provinces)\n4. Nations (aka Countries, States, Republics, etc)\n5. Global\n\nFor communication, we will consider cities as the \"lowest\" and global as the \"highest\" stratification level.\n \n> Additionally, a **community level** may be added below cities to further add accuracy and usefulness. \n\nFor the purpose of any geo-social system, **geographic association with each actor** must be defined. \n\nTraditionally, it's the existence within a certain area, such as a place of residence or business, that is of importance. When building a geo-social system, it's only necessary that association is declared at the lowest level of geographic stratification, from which the rest can be extrapolated. \n\nBecause each person can be associated to either a community or a city, we can develop systems within web 4 that allow coordination at every strata with just this one piece of data for each person. \n\n# Democracy, Collaboration, and ever-redefining Utopia\n\nBy offering time tokens to the individual that correspond to each stratum we can create **high-fidelity democratic systems** that better represent each and every person's desires. We can know exactly what the people want, with no guesswork, in a very short period of time. \n\nFor example, a person may be given 12 time tokens per month at each stratum to vote on the initiatives that they would like to see passed. They may vote all 12 tokens for an initiative they are most passionate about, or 1 token to 12 different initiatives (or 2 to 6 initiatives, etc). By collecting and counting these tokens, the governing body can **know exactly what their constituents want**, without the direct need to elect a representative who only estimates these desires. \n\nThe democratic system described in this paper does not solve all problems, as there are still issues of voter informedness, unseen actors, and more, but it is a skeleton to build a collaborative social system that are an **improvement to the representative governments** which were once as revolutionary as these ideas are. \n\n\n\n# Roadmap to Web 4 Reality\n\n## **Phase One**\n> Implementing time tokens\n\n**Time Tokens** are implemented on any and all blockchains where developers see the value. These developers provide open-source instructions and tools to helps other developers incorporate time tokens into their applications. \n\n**Provable individuality** for Time Tokens is up to each application and blockchain, and these application can choose to ignore this requirement, risking their systems' integrity. **Federated** (Facetec) and **decentralized** (Civic) options may be used, and so can social verification.\n\n**Information entropy** and **geosocial layers** are starting to be theorized, but not showing up. \n\n**Phase 1 Action Points**: \n- Time Token ERC proposal (and similar for other blockchains)\n- Developers exploring use cases for Time Tokens \n- Developers implementing Time Token in unexpected ways\n\n## **Phase Two**\n> dApps and discovering issues\n\n**Applications using Time Tokens** are widespread, and issues in implementations are becoming known and solved. \n\n**Provable identity** **issues** are becoming apparent, as certain applications with **lax rules** are being manipulated, showing the need for true provable identity. \n\nSocial Verification and solutions like Facetec are still used, while biocryptography standards and biometric secret technology are being developed to allow true provable identity (in Phase Three).\n\n**Information entropy** principles are starting to be implemented, when required.\n\n**Geo-social layers** are starting to be built, but not used for \"real applications\" like voting because of lack of true provable individuality. \n\n**Phase 2 Action Points**: \n- Proposing the best uses for geo-social layers using time tokens\n- Incorporating different provable identity methods\n\n\n## **Phase Three**\n> Implementing Provable Identity\n\n**Provable Identity** is now possible as suggested in this manifesto through the maturity of the biometric secrets. Standards are being created openly, \n\n**GeoSocial layers** are being used to run and govern communities which are not dependent on traditional representative government. Existing governments are adopting time tokens to get a better read on what legislation the people want. \n\n**Phase 3 Action Point**: \n- Creating provable identity solutions that satisfy all requirements\n\n## **Phase Four**\n> Geo-social systems\n\n**Information entropy** is added to the systems where it can be of use. For example, this could make a person's (anonymous) voting record less knowable over time by increasing the amount of CPU time needed to associate one vote with another. \n\n**GeoSocial layers** are being used as a replacement for representative government where it is the will of the people. Voter informedness is measured and known, as are the exact desires of the people. This creates collaboration and a renewed faith in democracy, and a feeling of belongingness and appreciation for each individual. \n\n**Phase 4 Action Points**: \n- Building and operating geo-social layers for the benefit of society and any collaborating group\n- Exploring use cases and integrating information entropy where appropriate\n\n# Author notes\n\n## Change Without Conflict\n**No one can stop us** from building collaborative systems with web 4 and even **self-governing**. **We don't need** to \"tear down the system\" or separate from society to do so. **We can exist** fully embedded in the geopolitical systems around us, while implementing and improving web 4 concepts, the underpinnings of collaborative democracy.\n\nIf and when the \"old system\" meets its demise, as all things do, **we can transition rapidly** to a web 4 system like [Effective Collective](https://github.com/dougbutner/effective-collective) or any other, as it will already be in place. \n\n## Why use the term \"Web 4\"\nIt is my belief that each version of the web must 1) be built on top of the previous version, 2) be fundamentally different than the previous version by introducing new technology, and 3) have meaningful impact on society. \n\nThis proposal for the next iteration of the web is an effort to both expand and shift the path of information science in a direction where the **meaningful impact** of society involves: 1) empowerment of each individual, which serve as the basis for collective (social), economic, and novel applications; 2) provable identity verification while maintaining complete separation from any federated system, including government, with the side-benefit of lifelong recoverability of private keys; and 3) resonance with our contained and containing systems, like our human organs and the Solar system, which provide us with life and free energy daily, akin to free time tokens.\n\nWhile an argument could easily be made that DeFi is Web 4, or another emerging tech, like \"layer 2\" blockchains (rollups) are web 4, both of these are **not new**. DeFi mimics and improves the systems of the past. Rollups are merely making web 3 **more efficient**. \n\nIt is my hope and desire that the information presented here will be **expanded** on and **implemented** by many developers and systems in the coming years, not for the benefit of the few, but for the **empowerment** of each individual and the **harmony** of the human collective, and every layer of Gaia. \n\n___\n# Notes + References\n___\n\n[1] - Solutions like Civic and Facetec have proved to be effective in verifying individuality. KYC services rely on government-issued identification, physical signature, and minimal, often human-checked bioverification. Until the technology is developed for a biometric system resembling the ideas here, these options (as well as social verification) are viable, though not fully embodying the idea of web 4. \n\n[2] - Hao, K. & O'Neill P.

It made me realize I really do need a problem solution section, which I decided not to do at first. I suppose the problem is only obvious to me.

Groups of people organizing, whether to turn a profit as a company, or to live together in a city, are often under-, mis-, or not represented at all in the decision making processes that affect their life. In both of these (governments and companies,) it is the few that make the decisions for the many, even with the illusion of \"having a say\" that exists in a representative system. \n\n# The Solution\nBy providing each individual with equal power in a transparent decision making process, the true intent of the majority can not only be known, it can be acted upon in predetermined ways through smart contracts. Though the solution seems simple, there are issues that will need to be addressed according to the needs of each group of collaborating people, such as ensuring one person per account, and limiting the minting of voting tokens with time, as well as protecting the privacy of decision makers where appropriate. This paper will detail these solutions, though they may not be needed for each system. For example, systems can (and should) be built using time tokens that do not use biometric data at all. \n\n> What the hell is this supposed to mean?\n\nMan, I'm really grateful for your reply. You are right. typo aside, it was a very convoluted message using vocabulary I used in a [different project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2JH9J73WjgZ9-cULJAzrYvZzyPSXEA_fdgt21lHnDc/preview) that has no real context here. So super glad to gut that before publishing. \n\nHere's what I changed it to:\n\n> In essence, web 4 is **collaboration consensus tool** that helps to manifest a shared desire, opinion, or solution by providing a fair system of accounting using time-limited votes, real people, and existing geopolitical stratification.\n\nHow 'bout dat?",

        "author": "10xpdev",
        "id": "sqj7v8",
        "selftext": "Having authored an open-source project for session management - [https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core](http://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core), I know some things about authentication and would like to share my findings. JSON Web Tokens (or JWTs) have become incredibly popular and you‚Äôve likely heard of them before. What you may not have heard is that JWTs were originally designed for use in OAuth ‚Äì which is fundamentally different to user sessions.  \n\n\nWhile the use of JWTs for OAuth is widely accepted, its use for authenticating users sessions is controversial (see [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22354534) post). In this article, I will attempt to make a comprehensive list of the pros and cons of using JWT for this context. I do not intend to solve this debate, since devs (*especially* devs) are often strongly opinionated. I only aim to summarize all the perspectives.  \n\n\nThe flow of the content is as follows:  \n\n\n* Advantages and disadvantages of JWTs (including common misconceptions)  \n\n* A proposed session management flow using JWTs and server sessions (opaque tokens)  \n\n* Evaluating the new flow  \n\n* Conclusion  \n\n\n**A cursory note on session management.**  \n\n\nUser sessions involve managing tokens across your app‚Äôs backend and frontend. These tokens act as a proxy to your‚Äôs identity and can either be:  \n\n\n* Opaque (a.k.a session tokens ‚Äì a long random meaningless string which is a reference to some information stored in a database)  \n\n* Non-opaque (contains some meaningful information like a userID, encoded in base64)  \n\n\nNon opaque tokens have a special property that enables the backend to verify that the token is legitimate. This is achieved by cryptographically signing them, and in doing so, we get what is known as a **JWT ‚Äì a signed, non-opaque token**.  \n\n\n*A clarification note:* I am only concerned with session management between an app‚Äôs backend APIs and frontend. There is no third party service involved (i.e. no OAuth 2.0).  \n\n\n## The Pros\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gw03u8rezbh81.gif\n\nThe following is a list of all the pros for using JWTs ‚Äì aggregated across multiple sources. These are benchmarked relative to opaque tokens (the only other type of token for sessions). I have also included some common misconceptions and have labeled them as ‚Äúmyths‚Äù:  \n\n\n**1)Fact: No database lookups**: It‚Äôs generally known that for most APIs, network calls add the most latency. Hence, it‚Äôs reasonable to expect that having no network calls (no database lookups) for session verification is beneficial.   \n\n\nTo prove this, I ran a test to see latency times (requests per second or RPS) of APIs that used JWTs and not. The displayed RPS are an average of running the tests 60 times. Following are the different APIs that were tested:  \n\n\n* API-control: This API does nothing and can be used as a maximum RPS reference  \n\n* API-1a: JWT verification and response  \n\n* API-1b: Opaque token verification via database and response\n* API-1c: Opaque token verification via cache and response\n* API-2a: JWT verification, a database read and response\n* API-2b: Opaque token verification via database, another database read and response\n* API-2c: Opaque token verification via cache, a database read and response\n\nFor each API, I set up the database / cache in three locations:   \n\n\n1) The same machine (as the API process)  \n\n\n2) A different machine, but within the same WiFi network   \n\n\n3) A different machine with a different network (to the API process), but within the same city (an AWS EC2 instance). All machines have roughly the same spec in terms of processing power and RAM.  \n\n\n### Results for API-1 (No extra database read):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/toazmcfhzbh81.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=aca1f5eb1d3414b70339ead6e968cf783e94eaf1\n\n### Results for API-2 (one extra database read in API):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mhorigizbh81.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ffd2748f5c1d801a3f8cca917a073cd88fe263c\n\nAs it can be seen, database lookups are indeed much slower, especially over distributed machines (which is very often the case). However, there are counters to this point:  \n\n\n* Other database calls in the API will slow it down anyways: This is true. However, I‚Äôd argue that most API calls don‚Äôt have 100s of db lookups but just a few of them. Hence you are eliminating a good percentage of latency causing actions *most of the time.*  \n\n* Other services have scaled successfully without JWT: This is also true (even Facebook doesn‚Äôt use JWTs). It is possible to scale well with opaque tokens, but it‚Äôs just much more difficult and expensive to do so (in terms of engineering costs as well as running costs).  \n\n\n**2)** **Myth: Saving on database space**: Since JWT‚Äôs don‚Äôt need to be stored in the database, it‚Äôs true that it does save space. To get a sense of how much, let‚Äôs do a back of an envelope calculation:  \n\n\n* Opaque tokens (64 characters long), would take 64 bytes of space.  \n\n* We want to associate a userId (36 bytes) and some session information with this token (200 bytes). Overall, it takes 300 bytes of space to store one user‚Äôs session information.  \n\n* If we assume an app has a million active sessions (which is a lot), that means it‚Äôs using 300 million bytes or 300 MB for sessions. 10 million sessions? 3GB of storage.  \n\n\nSo by using JWTs, we are saving 300 MB of database space per million users. This doesn‚Äôt make much difference since it would cost approximately $0.03 extra per month on AWS as per [their pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/).  \n\n\n**3)** **Myth: More secure because it‚Äôs signed:** The signing of the JWT token is only required so that clients cannot manipulate the content in the token. Whereas, opaque tokens cannot be manipulated since the string itself doesn‚Äôt have any meaning. Just having a long opaque token (high entropy) is good enough. Hence, the signing of JWTs doesn‚Äôt add any extra security in comparison to opaque tokens, it simply matches the security level.  \n\n\n**4) Myth: JWTs are easier to use:** It is true that JWTs are easier to get started with since we don‚Äôt have to take the effort to build a system that reads the database for session verification, or a cron job to remove expired tokens‚Ä¶ However, these are quite easy to implement anyway.  \n\n\n**5)** **Myth: JWTs are more flexible:** Flexibility comes because we can put anything in a JWT. However, we can do the same with opaque tokens. Any data can be stored in the database against an issued opaque access token.  \n\n\n**6)** **Myth: JWTs automatically prevent CSRF:** As long as we are using cookies for JWT (which is recommended), we also have to take care of CSRF attacks, just like if we use an opaque token. This attack vector will have to be prevented using anti CSRF tokens or SameSite cookie attribute, both of which are independent of if we use JWT or opaque tokens.  \n\n\n**7)** **Myth: No need to ask users for ‚Äòcookie consent‚Äô:** Cookie consent which is required for GDPR, applies only to cookies used for analytics and tracking. Not for keeping users logged in securly. JWTs and opaque tokens are the same in regards to this point.  \n\n\n**8)** **Other myths:** I have also read people claim that JWTs work better than opaque tokens for mobile and also work even if cookies are blocked. Both of these are simply not true.  \n\n\nOverall, it seems that the only advantage of JWT over opaque token is lesser latency in API requests (which is a major win). Now let‚Äôs have a look at the cons.  \n\n\n## The cons\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/04gaaipjzbh81.gif\n\nLike the above section, the following is a list of all the cons that I have thought about, as well as what I have read from other sources:  \n\n\n**1)** **Fact: Non revocable:** Since verifying JWTs doesn‚Äôt require any lookup to a single source of truth (database), revoking them before they expire can be difficult. I say difficult and not impossible because one can always change the JWT signing key and then all issued JWTs will be immediately revoked. Revocation is important in many cases:  \n\n\n* Logging out users  \n\n* Banning users instantly  \n\n* Changing user‚Äôs permission in your system  \n\n* Changing a user‚Äôs password  \n\n\nOne solution that people recommend is to use revocation lists. This is where you keep a list of revoked JWTs and check against that list when verifying the JWT. But if we do this, it‚Äôs *almost* the same as opaque tokens since we will have to do a database / cache lookup in each API. **I say** ***almost*** **since here, we have the option to choose which APIs should check against the blacklist and which should not.** So this may be an advantage in certain scenarios over opaque tokens.  \n\n\nOne more solution is to keep the lifetime of the JWT very small (\\~10 mins). However, this also means that users will be logged out every 10 mins. There are various session flows that one can implement to have short lived JWTs while maintaining a long session as explained in [this blog post](https://supertokens.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-user-session-security). We will be exploring the recommended method later in this post.  \n\n\n**2)** **Fact: Bottlenecked against one secret key:** If the signing key of the JWTs is compromised, then the attacker can use that to change the userId in their JWT to any other user‚Äôs. This allows them to hijack any user‚Äôs account in a system. This secret key can be compromised in a variety of ways like employees making a mistake (by pushing the key to github) or purposely leaking the key. Attacks to your servers might also leak this key.  \n\n\nA counter to this is that even opaque tokens from the database can be leaked. However, those are much harder to leak ¬†(because of their sheer volume) and cannot be used to compromise new accounts or accounts that don‚Äôt have an active session during the time of attack.   \n\n\n**3) Fact: Crypto deprecation:** Signing of JWTs requires use of a cryptography instrument called hashing. It is usually recommended to use SHA256 for this. However, what happens when this gets deprecated? At that point, one may want to switch to a newer algorithm. While making this change is relatively straightforward, the problem is that developers are very busy and often will miss out on such deprecations. That being said, such deprecations are very infrequent.  \n\n\n**4)** **Fact: Monitoring user devices:** In the most simple implementation, if one is using JWTs for their sessions without any session information stored in the database, their app will not be able to know which devices or how many devices a user is using. This may often cause business logic and analytics issues. This being said, it‚Äôs easy to add some information to the database when a JWT is issued and remove it once it expires. This way, this disadvantage can be mitigated. However, this is something that needs to be done purely outside the scope of a JWT (hence this point).  \n\n\n**5) Myth: Cookie size is too large:** A typical JWT can be 500 bytes long[*\\[1\\]*](https://supertokens.com/blog/are-you-using-jwts-for-user-sessions-in-the-correct-way#footer-note-1), versus a 36 or 64 bytes sized opaque token. These are to be sent to the frontend via cookies and these are sent to the backend on each API request. This causes two problems:  \n\n\n* No more space in cookie store: The maximum cookie size a browser allows is 4096 bytes per domain. Even if using a 500 byte JWT, we still have 87% of the cookie store left for use. This seems to be more than enough for most applications.  \n\n* Higher amount of data transferred on each API call: If we take the above numbers, we are transferring 464 bytes extra each API call (500 minus the size of an opaque token). This means, the client is uploading that much more and the server needs to download that much more for each API call.   \n\n   * If we assume that a client has an upload speed of 10kbps (very low), this means each API call will take an extra 46 milliseconds. In general, I believe this ¬†is completely acceptable. In typical situations (1mbps upload speed), this would take an extra 0.4 milliseconds per API request. For applications which are extremely sensitive to latency and want to save every millisecond, this is something that you could consider factoring in.  \n\n   * A typical EC2 instance on AWS has a download speed of 5+ gbps. Let‚Äôs assume a low of 1 gbps for argument‚Äôs sake. If we also assume that this instance gets 100k concurrent requests (which is very high!), this would imply that the server needs to download an extra 464 \\* 100k bytes = 46.4 MB of data. Given the download speed, it would take the server an extra 46.4 milliseconds across all the requests to do this which is insignificant.  \n\n\n**6) Myth: Data in JWT is visible to everyone:** First, the priority should be that JWTs themselves should not be accessible by anyone malicious because then they can gain unauthorised access to an account (which is a far bigger problem than being able to see the contents of the JWT). However, if that does happen, one should also refrain from putting any sensitive information in a JWT. Instead, one can store this information in the database. Either way, this is not a con of using JWTs.  \n\n\nSeeing the pros and the cons above, my opinion is that just using JWTs is probably not worth it. The risks, I feel, outweigh the benefits. However, what if we could use a different approach where we use both, opaque tokens and JWTs. Perhaps, this would allow us to eliminate the cons whilst keeping the pros?  \n\n\n### The new approach\n\nOnce the user logs in, the backend issues a short lived JWT (access token) and a long lived opaque token (refresh token). Both of these are sent to the frontend via httpOnly and secure cookies. The JWT is sent for each API call and is used to verify the session. Once the JWT expires, the frontend uses the opaque token to get a new JWT and a new opaque token. This is known as rotating refresh tokens. The new JWT is used to make subsequent API calls and the session continues normally. This flow is illustrated in the diagram below:  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1qtsgslzbh81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7be4914d9ca5767bc0234bf3472e6878f5a9c71\n\nNow let‚Äôs revisit pros and cons for this new session flow.  \n\n\n### Revisiting the pros:\n\n**1) No database lookups:** Since most API calls still use the JWT, this advantage still holds. We will need to call the database when refreshing the session, but this is a relatively rare event (relative to the number of session verifications that do not require a database lookup).  \n\n\n**Cookie 3; Localstorage 1**  \n\n\n**2)** **Added security via session hijacking detection:** Using rotating refresh tokens, we are now able to detect stolen tokens in a reliable way. This will help prevent session hijacking attacks. Learn more about it [here](https://supertokens.com/blog/the-best-way-to-securely-manage-user-sessions).  \n\n\nWe can see that the main advantage of using JWTs still holds, and we have also added a new advantage!  \n\n\n### Revisiting the cons:\n\n**1)** **Partially Solved: Non revocable:** We can use short lived JWTs and long lived refresh tokens to maintain a long session as well as get substantially more control on revocability. To revoke a session, we must now simply remove the opaque token from the database. This way, when the refresh API is called, we can detect that the session has expired and log out the user. Note that this will not immediately revoke a session ‚Äì it depends on the lifetime of the JWT. But it makes this problem much more bearable.  \n\n\n**2)** **Solved: Bottlenecked against one secret key:** We can keep changing the JWT signing key every fixed interval of time. When the key is changed, all current JWTs will be immediately invalidated. In this event, the frontend can simply use its refresh token to get a new JWT (and a new refresh token) signed with the new key. This way, we can vastly minimise our dependency on this secret key.  \n\n\n**3)** **Not solved: Crypto deprecation:** This point is still a problem, however, changing the hashing algorithm can be done smoothly and immediately just like how we change the signing key.  \n\n\n**4)** **Solved: Monitoring user devices:** Since we have an opaque token for each session, we can easily monitor the devices each user has.  \n\n\nWe can see that most of the cons have been roughly resolved and are now all acceptable risks.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nMy opinion is that using JWTs, especially for long lived sessions, is not a good idea. Using short lived JWTs with long lived opaque (refresh) tokens in the following scenarios:  \n\n\n* The need for **easier scalability** is higher than the need for **immediate token revocation**. The final decision depends on your use case. Do you expect your app to **scale to millions of users** (JWTs preferable) or less than tens of thousands (opaque tokens preferable)? How important is **instant revocation**? If you ban a user or detect theft, the token will continue to be valid till it expires (let‚Äôs say 30 minutes).  \n\n* The 4k bytes cookie size is not a limiting factor.  \n\n* You do not need to map ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù information to the access token that is required in each API call.  \n\n\nWhen I think of consumer apps that I want to develop, most of them meet the criteria above. I feel that it is a perfect balance between scalability and security. For all other requirements, stick to short lived opaque access tokens and long lived opaque refresh tokens.  \n\n\nNote that we have not spoken about the applicability of JWTs for OAuth and have only focused on sessions between an app‚Äôs backend API and frontend. JWTs are generally an excellent use case for delegation of access to third party services (OAuth). In fact, they were originally designed for this exact purpose.  \n\n\nWritten by the Folks at [SuperTokens](http://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core)  \n\n\n^(\\[1\\]: A typical JWT contains the following information:)  \n\n\n* ^(iss (issuer): site name (20 bytes is a good upper limit))  \n\n* ^(sub (subject): 36 bytes UUID)  \n\n* ^(aud (audience): site name (20 bytes is a good upper limit))  \n\n* ^(exp (expiry): timestamp: 13 bytes)  \n\n* ^(nbf (not before time): timestamp: 13 bytes)  \n\n* ^(iat (issued at time): timestamp: 13 bytes)  \n\n* ^(custom roles and information: 200 bytes more)  \n\n\n^(This is a total of 315 bytes. The JWT header is normally between 36 and 50 bytes and finally the signature is between 43 and 64 bytes. So this gives us a maximum of 429 bytes which would take about 10% of cookie space.)  \n\n\nShare you thoughts on the topic and let me know how I can make this note more useful to you",

So I take this *show off Saturday* opportunity to say I managed to do it, and it was simple and easy, and the customer and the customer's customers are happy.\n\nSometimes simple solutions are better.\n\n**An important note, if a user explicitly chose a specific language, please try to remember this for the next visit to your website.

So nothing gets gained or lost in that aspect.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n>DNT is not widely adopted by the industry, with companies citing the lack of legal mandates for its use, as well as unclear standards and guidelines for how websites are to interpret the header\n\nThis sounds like it was a great cue for EU to just enforce the DNT more strictly, rather than going through all the hassle of making everyone do something completely new for the same purpose.\n\nSo, where did things go wrong for DNT?

Just like you said, i'll check if the language cookie exists or not and decide if it is a new/recurring user based on that! This way, i won't need to add a id! I won't be able to track specific users that way, but that is not the goal anyways!\n\nAm i missing something obvious and creating an id is necessary, or do you think this could work?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your input!",

        "selftext": "\\*\\*I think I have followed the rules correctly, if not please let me know\\*\\*\n\nHi.\n\nI am working on making a SaaS idea of my own. At the moment I am mainly focusing on the front end so I can get a preliminary mockup set up and running so as to pitch and get funding to pay developers. This may just be done in something like Adobe XD, Photoshop etc. if it is enough.\n\nSaying this I stilll would like to get an at least foundational understanding of the technology involved in the idea's developments so that if necessary I can develop it further myself or at-least understand what the developers are doing. .\n\n# Context:\n\nI am a university student in the field of STEM without any real background in web development and software engineering and I do not intend to work in his field when I enter the real world. I know C + Arduino and have started doing a couple courses on [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).\n\n# What I am trying to do:\n\nMy idea (without highlighting exactly what it is) would involve the following features:\n\n* User Accounts\n* Payments, recurring and one off which can scale automatically based on customer usage\n* Databases with user generated content that can be edited by users and accessed with the users' consent\n* Data analysis that checks for keywords in a users post that then scrapes our internal database for matches and then attaches this information to the post\n* A highly configurable & automated post filtering system for users to choose what comes up in their feed. (this is an analogy that reflects largely what I am looking for)\n* Database searching with an inordinate amount of variables that the user can configure in order to look for what they want\n* An automated post searching system, users set what they are looking for, the post goes off and looks for that stuff and returns on a regular basis e.g. bi weekly email with highlights\n* RPA allowing for automated emails notifications etc.\n* lastly a dashboard showing a data funnel for things like things in queue to read, how many posts have been created etc.\n\n# What have I researched so far:\n\nSo I've begun working on the [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) courses to get an idea of the elements that I may need to get going. I've also had a look through on the internet at information that comes up on google with my search terms and have come up with following understanding:\n\n**Front End:**\n\n* What the users will actually see. Things to learn: HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, React.\n* Dashboard: ?\n* I've looked at Webflow and its not flexible enough for my needs.\n* Flutter?\n\n**Back End:**\n\n* Node.JS\n* Payments: Stripe.JS\n* User Accounts: Passport.JS\n* Databases: I've heard of MongoDB? Don't know what it does or how it would interact.\n* Data Analysis: Python + SQL pings. Don't know how it would interact with the rest of the system.\n* Filtering system: ?\n* Automated searching: ?\n* Emails: Sendgrid, MailChimp, Button-down, can this be inbuilt so I don't have to pay another company?\n* RPA: Check respective app's api e.g. Discord.JS\n\n**How to host it is then a whole other question.**\n\n# What help am I looking for?\n\nI  am not asking for: how to get into the industry, how to start learning, what is best to get hired in x company or industry.\n\nWhat I AM asking for is essentially:\n\n* Am I on the right track and do I have a correct understanding of what I intend to learn?\n* Any pointers for the information that I don't know or may not have thought about?\n* Tips, alternatives, recommendations, references that would make journey easier.\n\nThank you so much for any and all information.",

It will be stand-alone for information only.  Other than a bare-bones visitor count, I will not design the site to intentionally harvest any other information from visitors.\n\nWhat I want to know is, is the site is not harvesting data, and ask for no data or provides anyone for the users to even input any data, does the privacy laws still require have things like a Cookie Consent and a Privacy Disclaimer?\n\nI obviously want to obey the law, I just think that having disclaimer popups about Cookies and Tracking will be give the wrong impression about the site's purpose.

You could also consider offering a discreet cookie notice, maybe without a pop-up, as an alternative, ensuring the user experience aligns with your site's message of privacy and simplicity.\n\nWhile it's understandable to not want pop-ups, the key is transparency.

But the data you collect cannot identify a specific person without extreme dedication.\n\nSo town/state/country are a definite no. You could pretty easily identify a user from their town, depending on the content of the site (i.e. if it's niche, there's less people in town who'd be your \"target\").

Finding 1 person in a group of 33,000 isn't \"impossible\".\n\nUser IDs/email address/etc. are obvious nos. But a session ID *could* be ok if the ID is completely random and there is no storage of it anywhere; i.e. you were using it to be able to track user journeys...

So again, probably safer to leave it out.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think there's a hard and fast rule on what is \"personally identifiable\", outside of the obvious things (user ID, email address, phone number, name, etc.) so I would generally just say that if could I look at the analytics and say which data is **likely** mine (it may not be, but based on the data it could be), then it is personally identifiable.

Thing is, basically every website uses cookies. The law had good intention, but all it really did was make everyone deal with an annoying pop-up each time they go to a new site.\n\nChatbots are also annoying IMO, but I usually only see them in contexts where they're relevant. Eg. When I'm looking through subscription options from some ISP, or other contexts where I might actually want to talk to a representative for a minute.\n\nExtensions: I'm not sure what you mean by this.

This data is not being shared with or sold to any third-parties. Since we don't make money from targeted advertisement, we must ask for a small fee to keep the servers running. \n\nCorrect.",

First, good on you for having the sense to ask before doing.\n\nYou do not want to track any user behavior without tracking / cookie consent, otherwise you will be liable in countries protected by gdpr law. The only way to get around this is to not provide service in EU countries.\n\nJust add a standard TOS contract & a tracking consent banner. They're everywhere nowadays.\n\nAlso, be wary of forwarding personally identifiable info to any analytics vendors you use (such as amplitude). Everything needs to be anonymized. If you use email as a unique users identifier, then you'll want to encrypt before sending. Many dev sdks for sending data do not do this for you, and may also auto-collect other info such as IP. Even browser settings can fall under this category (ex, browser / device fingerprinting).\n\nBy venturing into behavioral tracking territory, you are now considered a \"data controller\" under gdpr. If you do not anonymize data sent to 3rd parties, then you need to provide mechanisms allowing your users to perma-delete their data from said 3rd parties.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: By the way, my recommendation if you think you will lean into behavioral tracking, is to send data through segment.io. At my work, we built our own multi-destination pipeline, but segment is a great product for smaller apps.",

The localStorage is a boolean stored on the USER side. No user data is stored or acquired on the server to achieve the unique count that wouldn't already be present with any other HTTP request. If you visit a site from Google search results, the HTTP request for your first page view before agreeing to any policy is exactly the same as the ajax HTTP request that would be ran under the hood for incrementing the unique tally. It's perfectly legal to count page views and unique visits without user consent if you're utilizing either of the two methods (localStorage or 304 Not Modified) described in my previous post. As mentioned earlier, any argument otherwise is the equivalent to saying a restaurant owner can't count the number of people who walk into their restaurant every day without the express consent of each customer.\n\nOnce you start using persistent session IDs and/or logging IP addresses to count unique page views, then there's an argument to be had. But the two methods I've described are not in a gray area and do not require user consent since neither method gives you ANY means to actually track or identify the user in subsequent HTTP requests - there's no ID or hash to identify them in any way (even anonymously). There's no data link of any kind. No names, no IP addresses, no hashes, no codes - zip zero nada.\n\nFrankly the fact this is even an issue shows how absurd the laws are and how absurd people's interpretations of said laws are.  Look at your web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS - whatever) - even if you're not counting anything on your website or using any cookies of any kind, chances are your server is logging all kinds of crap (IP addresses, user agents, referrers, etc.) behind the scenes and chances are your firewall is logging all kinds of crap behind the scenes. I bet 2/3 of the people here saying you need user consent to count unique views have all of the aforementioned logs running behind the scenes on the server or firewall level without nary a thought about disabling them. Furthermore, people running smaller web applications via shared hosting providers wouldn't even have the means to disable such logs. Please stop intimidating people against doing something as harmless as incrementing a phucking number in a phucking database.",

It's about requiring user consent regarding the collection of user data (including anonymous data) that is not \"strictly necessary.\" So you're absolutely right about the scope of it. But this method does not collect ANY data, identifiable or anonymous. I've read through numerous FAQs and EU documents on the topic and have found absolutely nothing that distinguishes the method I've just described from any other regular page view that would exist and be recorded prior to someone accepting or rejecting a cookie or privacy policy. The method I've described equates to a page view - nothing more. It involves nothing more than an HTTP request. It requires no identifying HTTP headers, nor does it anonymize data (meaning it does NOT take identifiable data and convert it to anonymous data). It's literally just a page view. All that is different is it is only viewed once. You aren't storing ANY user data whatsoever. You're incrementing a single number. It's perfectly legal to count page views and measure server load. How is this any different? That's like saying a restaurant owner isn't allowed to count the number of people walking through their door every day without the express consent of each patron.\n\nAnother way to count unique views without a notice is via asset caching. For example, if you send a cache header for a regular asset (like a CSS stylesheet that is present on every page) that expires in X days, there's nothing stopping you from incrementing your unique views everytime you send an HTTP response for that asset that doesn't include a \"304 Not Modified\" header.",

Don't jeopardise that trust right out of the gates\n\nThere are two ways to do multi-part forms properly.  First would be to make the requirements clear, ie, indicate before the user starts that there's going to be multiple parts.  Second would be to honour the initial agreement - ie, provide the report after the user provides the email address as advertised, and make the second step of the form optional",

You don't get the loyalty program, but you still get the core service.\n\nA/B testing is admittedly trickier. You will be processing data which one *can* argue is personal, and for a purpose not essential to the core service you're providing. I was too quick to jump to it not being personal data, when the truth is it's ambiguous enough that you cannot be certain it's safe from regulatory action. There's no precedent to tell us whether it is or not, yet.\n\nIt all depends on the scope of your A/B testing.\n\nIf your A/B testing is as simple as \"how many sales do we have on version 1, 2, and 3 respectively?\" then it is not processing personal data at all. There is literally no identifiable information of any kind being stored or processed.\n\nThe second it turns identifiable, then you're in opt-in territory.   \nFact of the matter is though a lot of A/B testing can be done entirely anonymously. A/B systems just aren't typically designed for being anonymous because the business doesn't give a shit.\n\nRegistering mouse coordinate data for instance, isn't inherently under the purview of the GDPR, it's only when you tie it to an identifier like a cookie or user ID that it is. Pretty much all A/B testing systems do that though, so it becomes a GDPR matter. \n\nSo the real question is, what kind of A/B testing is being done, what kind of data is being stored, and can it all be entirely anonymous... If it can be, then you're golden.\n\nPs. I feel like enticing opt-in is a fantastic way to get regulatory bodies on your ass. I wouldn't touch that with a ten-foot pole. \n\nPPs. We all need to ask ourselves as the ones creating these services if we're actually fighting tooth and nail for something that's actually beneficial, or if we're just used to a certain way of doing things and have an idea what we're doing is \"good for business\".",

The A/B testing we conduct is entirely centered on page layout, and no personal data is collected - we can't even drill down into individual session data.\n\nHowever, [the ICO only gives three examples of cookies exempt from opt-in](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/#exemptions):\n\n>...you are unlikely to need consent for:  \n>  \n>‚Ä¢ cookies used to remember the goods a user wishes to buy when they add goods to their online basket or proceed to the checkout on an internet shopping website;  \n>  \n>‚Ä¢ session cookies providing security that is essential to comply with data protection security requirements for an online service the user has requested ‚Äì eg online banking services; or  \n>  \n>‚Ä¢ load-balancing cookies that ensure the content of your page loads quickly and effectively by distributing the workload across several computers.\n\nThe new Head of IT is incredibly risk-averse, and so interprets this as meaning that all A/B testing requires consent. \n\nThe only writing I can find about whether or not A/B testing is allowed without consent or as opt-out post-2018 comes from either cookie solution software providers (which have a strong incentive to say that we need to pay for their software in order to A/B test) and [this page,](https://www.convert.com/blog/privacy/analytics-and-a-b-testing-cookies-only-after-consent-in-europe/) which can only provide a solid statement on the issue from the French authorities.
