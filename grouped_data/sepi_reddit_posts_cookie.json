Personally, I'm quite satisfied with the combination of Firefox + uBlock Origin + enabling the \"Annoyances – Cookie Banners\" lists, but I'm also OK with websites that don't always work correctly. This also works on mobile devices.\n\n\nWhat attempts are there to address the cookie consent problem?\n\n\n\nBrowser makers have started to support some degree of tracking without legally needing consent. E.g. Google's Privacy Sandbox initiatives, or Mozilla's/Meta's Privacy Preserving Attribution. But there are debates about whether that's lawful. Also, websites using these features will still ask for consent because they'd like to do *more* tracking.\n\n\nGermany has passed a law that allows the establishment of central consent management services. Consent once, and participating websites don't have to ask themselves. But no such service actually exists. And even if it did exist, most websites wouldn't participate, and even if they'd participate, they would still show a consent banner to ask for additional consents.\n\n\nSimilarly, browser-based consent management wouldn't work in practice. Unless you say \"yes\" to everything, websites will look for every possible way to coerce you into consenting. A broad \"consent to all\" is not legally possible, because the GDPR requires that consent is informed and specific, that you know what you're getting yourself into. But this is all hypothetical, as no browser vendor is interested in the liability of running such a system.\n\n\nRoughly one decade ago, there was an \"ePrivacy Regulation\" proposal that would have greatly reduced the need for cookie consent, by allowing opt-out approaches for low-risk purposes. (While still needing consent for things like cross-site tracking that's the foundation of online behavioural advertising). However, this law was never passed. In particular, parts of the advertising industry like Google lobbied *hard* against the proposed rules.\n\n\nSo in summary, everyone knows it's a problem, but websites + ad networks have no interest in change, browsers have been captured by advertisers, EU level legislators don't feel this is urgent enough, and national legislators are unable to make meaningful changes.",

It requites it for tracking, targetting, giving your data to others and so on.\n\nAlso, GDPR is the reason you can buy something offline without accepting marketing letters - data can only be used for the purpose it was given.\n\nYou fell for the oldest trick in the bool: Blame regulations for companies on the regulator, not on companies who want to abuse your data and earn a pretty penny with it.",

Right now I'm only using a single cookie (once someone logs in, to have their authentication persist), and because that is strictly essential I don't have a cookie banner (but of course I do provide information in the privacy policy). Aside from that I'm using Plausible analytics for example which doesn't use cookies (can recommend!). I'd really like to keep my website cookie-free (barring essential ones), but I also know that I can't keep it running without advertising. This isn't inherently a problem because of course it's theoretically possible to advertise based on context etc, but as a starting platform the practical options for that are limited. \n\nI found EthicalAds which seems wonderful but is focused on the programming/developer niche, and my platform is focused on relaxation and sleep. Google Ads seems like the most accessible option for advertising but of course they aren't GDPR compliant without a cookie banner. I'm not sure there's a foolproof way to disable all of their cookies while still running non-personalized ads, with the goal of staying cookie-free and GDPR-complaint by default. Any suggestions?",

Sure, they might not do tracking or set cookies, so there's a good chance that no ePrivacy concerns apply.\n\nBut if a publisher embeds third party content (such as ads), this implies that personal data (such as IP addresses) is shared with the ad network. That requires a legal basis. Compare the infamous *Google Fonts* case. All of this would be a lot simpler if the ad network would act as the publisher's data processor, but I don't think any ad network is willing to do that. EthicalAds definitely doesn't.\n\nSkimming through the EthicalAds privacy notice, it seems they think that GDPR does not apply to their ad network activities because they don't store personal data relating to ad viewers. Thus, they don't even provide a \"legal basis\" for these ad network activities. Despite demonstrating a quite privacy-friendly ad design, I find this difficult to reconcile with my understanding of the GDPR.\n\n> I'm building a video platform …  I also know that I can't keep it running without advertising\n\nI'm aware of at least one video platform that is not ad-supported: Nebula.

You probably found it via a link somewhere, maybe something you searched for on google.\n\nInternet advertising to some extent is an issue for major discussion, but there is no such thing as personalised ads when I watch TV or read a newspaper. Both of those make money through advertising but everyone who watches the TV channel (at least within my region) or reads that edition of the newspaper is going to see the same ads, so why not on the internet?\n\nThe other thing that is different is that those who pay for the advertising on TV or in a newspaper pay a fixed amount - with TV possibly based on the length of the ad and when it is shown, in a newspaper often based on the size of the ad and what page it appears on. What neither pays for is the result of their advertising - i.e. when I watch TV and an ad-break comes on, if I haven't left the room at the time, it's still highly unlikely I'm immediately going to rush onto amazon and buy the advertised product. So why do they advertise? To let me know it's there so if there comes a time when I need it, I will possibly buy it.\n\nBut internet advertising appears to be different. They expect you to \"click\". The ads are often extremely intrusive and most of the time are served up by 3rd party ad-servers, which of course many of us block, including me. I only block them because they are annoying and intrusive, but another thing: if the content provider simply put something like \"this page is sponsored by ... \" at the top (and I have seen that done) it won't get blocked. I know because I have ad blockers and those are not blocked.\n\nThe other thing is that those who put their content on the web will use 3rd parties to do this, or use such tools that do all the above, and it is not actually the companies themselves who make these choices, at least not deliberately.\n\nThe fact these banners usually start with \"We respect your privacy\" or \"Your privacy matters to us\" when it clearly doesn't, and that they all look the same, to me acts as a clear indicator. This reminds me of when in around 2011 I had a page provided by [webs.com](http://webs.com) that made users fill in an illegible captcha when they logged in. I didn't want it there but had no way to remove it (nor later to start clicking on squares with whatever pictures). Similarly I wouldn't want my users to have to decline cookies, as I wouldn't use any that were not strictly necessary, and if they were just reading \"open\" content that didn't need an account, I wouldn't need to know who they were at all.",

Surely, accepting tracking is a consideration on the user's behalf, who is offering something valuable in exchange for a service, the cookies are the cost of using the service. You can't make the argument that cookies aren't valuable; several of the most profitable companies on earth make huge portions of their income from collecting data for use in advertising, so you, as a user of Google or Facebook, are offering your valuable data, in exchange for the use of their service; that sounds a lot like payment, surely changing the medium of exchange makes no difference.

Remember, the mere fact of asking for consent is indicative that what they're doing does not fall under \"necessity for contract\" or \"legitimate interest\".\n\nThe use of the word \"consent\" was a deliberate choice.  It is widely understood that this does not mean mere permission.  Think about what you're saying, and translate it to other contexts.  GDPR creates individual rights.  You can't sign away your rights for consideration in this manner.  I can't put a sign on my door saying that you as a visitor agree to pay me £100 or otherwise consent to, say, me injuring or killing you, or appropriating your car, or voting on your behalf, etc.  We clearly understand that those entail fundamental rights that cannot be contracted away.\n\nQuite simply, the \"consent or pay\" model can't be treated as an alternative form of payment, because you can't \"pay\" with consent.",

This issue can’t really be solved with a cookie banner.  \n\nIn addition to that, there have been numerous class action lawsuits based on various U.S. privacy laws.  Eg the Video Privacy Protection Act, which protects the PII of individuals who rent videos - this has been applied to cookies used by embedded video streaming on websites, ie people have claimed information about what they have streamed has been shared with third parties without their consent in violation of the VPPA.  For this and a few other reasons US websites are starting to get consent for certain types of cookies",

In fact it more and more relies on other techniques to circumvent third-party cookies blocking and similar \"defences\".\n\nSo the right question is \"Can I accept tracking on websites even though Chrome is configured to not accept third-party cookies?\".\n\nThe answer is no, because:\n- See my first sentence.\n- If you value privacy do not use the browser of the biggest tracking company in the world (**Google** Chrome), use an alternative like Firefox or at least Brave.\n- Even if you refuse tracking on websites, it does not ensure you won't be tracked. In fact, a lot of websites track you as soon as you land on their home page, even though you haven't had a chance to interact with the consent panel yet.\n\nUntil the authorities do their job and really enforce GDPR (and even then, they can't do much against companies/websites which have no presence in the EU), the most effective way to prevent tracking is to use a dedicated browser extension. The best one is uBlock Origin, and it soon won't be as effective as it was on Chrome or other Chromium-based browsers (because of Manifest V3). So again, use Firefox or one of its forks. I am not sure Brave (which is Chromium-based) will still support Manifest V2 when V3 rolls out, and Brave's own tracking protection is lackluster compared to uBO.",

I am not sure it's possible, except maybe if you serve them yourself and don't share user's data with the third party. But if you do so I suppose you will have a hard time proving to that third party how many real users you served the ad to, which is probably the basis used by the third party to calculate how much to pay you. And if the user can click on the ad to be redirected somewhere I suppose it means you share user's data with the third party anyway and therefore need a legal basis.",

Anyway, idk how this will be seen once the EDPB-shepherded Meta decision will come out in January. See below a brief contractual and DP assessment and some ranting in the end. \n\nSo, pursuing the assessment of this practical scenario starting with what basically means paying for smth - it's a contract, right? If you pay for smth, then you have a contract.  \n\nThis being said, I take an issue with the contractual side of this. Basically, it's a payment in kind for access to a service, which should be covered in the website TCs and will be subject to consumer protection legislation - especially the provisions related to Digital Content Services in the EU. And this is just to start a discussion on this, if anyone's interested. As above, this is subject to the Meta decision acquis in a sense that, if the EDPB says that marketing processing cannot be subject to a contract, but only to consent separate from a contract (and signs are this will be the case), then you still need consent to process the personal data for marketing ends, which will potentially kill the practice subject to our talk. We're moving in circles. Best solution is to create paywalls with subscriber-only accessible content - but that's only for the big publishers, not for everyone. Anyway, it's not my job to decide who's getting paid here and who pays. \n\nAlso, w/out repeating the above arguments on consent validity, am just noting that the consent should be informed, i.e., the privacy notice should be sufficiently detailed to explain what happens w/ the user's data, who uses it (this is where the third parties mentioned above and what they do should be presented in clear language) and to what end. Have never seen a privacy notice that comes even close to the GDPR standards on discussing advertising processing purposes; and here comes the ranting: the IAB framework is a joke; the overall interest is to dupe uneducated users into providing their data for marketing purposes, which can be monetized quickly and w/out regrets; unbiased consent is dead, long live dark patterns!",

More money to Google and Facebook. So we need a level playing field where those two also can't use it.\n\nFinger printing is just another way of tracking users.

I disagree with how you seem to be fighting this battle. If that is not handled carefully, and a good amount of publishers see their ability to serve even non-personalized ads removed, that will have very negative effects.\n\nI am very aware of the efforts of the NPO in The Netherlands, since that is actually my home country.

They also have a good amount of video content that is in high demand, which does not compare very well to advertising around written content that makes up most of the web. Let alone the budget to market these solutions (which is basically just grouping titles into some content categories) towards advertising agencies and the agreements that are involved in that.

These data protection rules do not distinguish commercial purposes from other purposes. From the GDPR perspective, data controller is whoever determines the purposes and means of processing of the personal data, regardless of their motivation. A publicly accessible blog generally falls outside of the GDPR's exemption for purely personal or household purposes.\n\nSo yes, you will need a privacy notice since you will be processing personal data of visitors and contributors. See Art 13 GDPR for the exact requirements, but the ICO has published excellent summaries and checklists for the “right to be informed”.\n\nUnder certain conditions, you are required to ask the data subjects/users for consent before doing something. In particular, this is the case when accessing or storing information on the user's device, such as by using cookies, unless that access/storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user. For example:\n\n* cookies for advertisement purposes → not strictly necessary for the site to work, needs consent\n* session cookies for logged-in users → strictly necessary, no consent needed\n* CSRF protection cookies → strictly necessary for the site to work securely, no consent needed\n* cookie to remember consent status → strictly necessary, no consent needed\n\nOnly if you do something that needs consent will you have to show consent/cookie banners. It is quite possible that you will not need to show a consent banner, similar to how GitHub decided to remove friction by getting rid of non-necessary cookies.\n\nIf you do have to ask for consent, you must consider the Art 7 GDPR requirements (again summarised by excellent ICO guidance). Consent must be the user's free choice, they must be able to decline without suffering detriment. Using a third party consent management solution can help, but doesn't automatically make you compliant.",

I show a cookie banner that, practically speaking, leaves three choices:\n\n* the user explicitly consents for non-necessary cookies\n* the user explicitly declines consent for non-necessary cookies\n* the user ignores the cookie banner\n\nI think we can agree that things are clear for options #1 and #3: If the user accepts non-necessary cookies, fine. If the user does not indicate any wishes, then no consent is given (consent is never the default) and I can't set unnecessary cookies or load tracking or third party content or whatever.\n\nBut the second option is interesting here. The user has indicated that they are not interested in giving consent, and I should honour that decision.\n\nIf I don't remember that decision anywhere, then the next time the user loads a page (such as following a link on my website), they'll get the cookie banner again. For each page, they'd have to click the banner away again. Even though they declined consent on a previous page, that user would be indistinguishable from a new visitor who was never asked for consent.\n\nI think this clearly violates the spirit of ePrivacy/GDPR, as it is essentially a kind of nagging/dark pattern – the only way to durably get rid of the cookie banner would be to give consent, which doesn't sound like a freely given choice.\n\nSo, to honour the user's decision to not give consent, it is *strictly necessary* to remember that decision. On websites that offer user registration, this decision can and should be stored server-side. For other sites, client-side storage such as cookies is the only option.\n\nThe only other solution to this dilemma that I see is to argue that any consent solution that potentially distracts the user or gets in the way is per se noncompliant.\n\nI want to underline ePrivacy's strict necessity principle does not allow information from cookies to be reused for different purposes. For example, if a cookie is set as strictly necessary for consent management purposes, then I cannot also use that cookie to detect returning visitors for other purposes like analytics.\n\nThe consent status cookie problem also doesn't arise in those situations where no banner or popup is needed. For example, if I'm asking for consent to load third party content on a web page, then I can replace that content with a placeholder which asks for consent. In that scenario, I'd be totally with you that no cookie would be necessary to remember the “user has not yet given consent” status.",

Here is my long overdue reply.\n\nI get the dilemma you are pointing to; if a user refuses the cookie, he will be faced again and again and again with a consent banner. But I believe this is a false dilemma because it is created by those wanting to use non-essential technologies in the first place. \n\nConsent banners are doing these checks in an unlawful and backwards way. How it should work is that:\n\n1) User requests the webpage\n\n2) The consent platform checks if the user has accepted non-essential technologies by looking for a cookie indicating which non-essential technologies to load.\n\nIf the user is visiting the site for the first time they will not have such a cookie set. If the user has visited previously, but rejected cookies, they also should not have such a cookie. The default under ePrivacy and the Planet49 judgement is that only strictly necessary cookies are permitted without consent.\n\nRecording whether non-essential technologies are refused is not strictly necessary. The argument to the contrary, that it needs to be set because otherwise the banner will be presented each time, stems from the fact that the webpage wants to use non-essential technologies in the first place.\n\n3) Most websites would then load a consent banner irrespective of whether or not a cookie storing that a user has consented exists or not. \n\n4) If the user then does not consent to anything. You shouldn't set a cookie that says that the user hasn't consented to anything. This would be contrary to the ePrivacy directive because it isn't necessary. The default is no unnecessary storage, which entails that if the user doesn't consent to anything, there is no need to store anything - the absence of a preference cookie is enough to determine not to load any non-essential technologies. Only when the user consents is a cookie needed indicating which technologies was consented to. \n\n\\-\n\nI get that this in practice will lead to constant reoccurring cookie banners, but that is only because the website wishes to use the non-essential technologies in the first place. \n\nThe banner that will keep re showing is only an issue because the ad tracking industry chooses to do so. You can absolutely honor the users choice to refuse to consent without storing that refusal in a cookie. It is then a choice to keep showing the consent banner. \n\nBut the mere inconvenience of constantly reoccurring banners does not impact the necessity test under law.

One thing they emphasize is that giving consent and declining consent must be equally easy. While they don't state this explicitly, I think this goes beyond counting how many clicks are necessary to give or decline consent – it should also mean that I should remember given/declined consent status for a similar amount of time. They do explicitly mention that consent status can be managed without long-term identifiers in cookies, but unfortunately they don't state the reverse that storing declined consent with a simple `consent=no` cookie would typically be acceptable.",

Article 4(11) of GDPR defines consent:   \n“Consent of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.”  \nHere’s a primer on what constitutes a compliant cookie banner or popup.\n\n* Display a cookie banner on a user’s first visit to your website.\n* Inform users that your site uses cookies, why it's used or their purposes in plain, simple language.\n* Collect users’ active consent to cookies i.e. display both ‘accept’ and ‘reject’ cookies button.\n* Give users the option to opt-in to specific cookie categories. (For eg. in the second layer of the cookie banner)\n* Do not use pre-ticked or ‘on’ sliders for cookies other than strictly necessary cookies.\n* Block third-party cookies from being set on the user’s device until the user gives explicit consent for their use. (This can be automated through consent management platforms or CMPs like CookieYes)\n* Store cookie consents in case you are subject to audit or you have to demonstrate proof that your site is compliant.\n* Have a cookie policy within your privacy policy or as a separate page in your website.\n* Provide detailed information – name of the provider that sets the cookie (first-party or third-party), description and cookie duration in your cookie policy.\n* Give users a user-friendly and easily accessible option to revoke or withdraw consent.\n* Do not use cookie walls that prevent access to the website (unless the user accepts or is forced to accept cookies)\n* Do not set cookies if the user is scrolling or continuing to use a website without interacting with the cookie banner.\n* Some Data Protection Authorities like the Italian DPA also requires the banner to have a close button so users can dismiss it easily.  \nDepending on the EU member state your website is primarily based in or caters to the specific guidelines may differ. These are generally published by the respective DPA such as CNIL in France, AEPD in Spain, GDDP in Italy and so on.",

If the service is essential, monopolised and/or the individual cannot afford to overcome the paywall, they would have no choice but to “consent”. If you deny that person a service unless they “consent”, their “consent” would not have been freely given. \n\nTherefore, the appropriateness of a cookie paywall largely depends on nature of the service offered. In a democratic society in which every person, rich or poor, has an equal voice, and in which journalism provides important checks and balances on our constitutional institutions, it is arguably distasteful to require poor people to sell their privacy (assuming the UK GDPR and not merely PECR applies to these hypothetical cookies - e.g. due to the level of tracking and personalisation), a human right, for access to professional journalism.",

That isn’t to say that vaguely similar models haven’t been adopted. The BBC is funded by licence fees, for example, and its news is provided free of charge. Parliament has power to abolish the licence fee, which is currently a hot political issue.\n\nAs to revenue from *personalised* adverts being the *only* feasible business model for private news corporations, I am going to have to take your word for it. I would never profess to have expertise in business. I thought, though, that some news corporations offer key, political, “public-interest” articles free of charge without cookie paywalls, but generate additional revenue streams by charging for access to other things like hard copies, articles on lifestyle, fashion, food, sport, celebrity culture, special features, music, film, television, as well as other commentary and reviews, sometimes in the form of supplementary magazines. Many also rely on donations, which can be substantial. It is also worth remembering that not every user refuses to provide their consent to personalised adverts - I would be interested to know the statistics. It shouldn’t be forgotten that many users find personalised adverts desirable.\n\nAssuming you are right, yes, it is a valid point and courts are always going to need to weigh up and balance individuals’ rights with the rights of others and the public interest at large. If not having cookie paywalls would mean that private news corporations would fold, this would likely not be in the public interest as society would lose a large chunk of its independent journalism.",

Yikes, public interest much? I am actually surprised it's so low, in France a lot of people bash newspapers and other media for supposedly living off government aids.\n- more than 66% (!!!) of revenue come from from subscriptions and sales\n- ads revenue is allegedly falling and not that great anymore. Though they still have an illegal paywall (consent to cookies or subscribe) and do not disclose in the linked article how much revenue ads are actually generating, which I find suspicious.\n- partnerships and sponsorships (donations, news aggregators...)\n- [...]\n\nStatitics about many newspapers and media are required to try to establish if the majority of them have revenu streams similar to Le Monde or if it's an exception.\n\nBut IMO your question is actually bigger than journalism related websites: Really it's about the fact that people are used to having access to all websites for free while websites survive mostly thanks to (targeted, as you said) ads. But that business model is not compatible with privacy legislations such as GDPR: [Look at what NOYB recently did to Facebook.](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-surveillance-capitalism/) So we are at a crossroad where many websites will die if they don't manage to radically change their business model. Subscription only access (e.g. Netflix) might work if the website manages to convince people that the provided service is worth it, but I guess a lot of websites won't be able to pull that off.\\\nPeople will also have to drop the \"everything on the internet is free\" mindset, but it will take time, time during which a lot of websites will die. I am not sure it's a bad thing though, at least for all the clickbait focused websites not providing anything original or of any value.",

And I feel GDPR requirements about consent may also have been inspired by another French legal principle: the [unavailability of the human body](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indisponibilit%C3%A9_du_corps_humain), which basically means you cannot sell/rent your body or parts of it because it would be a violation of your [dignity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity), as it would mean you are a mere thing, not a person.

For those too young to know, there was a time when you would go to a website and be presented a form of your \"interests\" that you filled with a few clicks and then they would serve you ads accordingly. \n\n\\- There are many websites that use the \"pay to remove ads\" model. The difference is \"pay us to remove the annoying ads\" instead of \"pay us to stop selling your personal information\". \n\n\\- Donation models. People get to choose how much they are willing to pay to support their news outlet so that people who have the means can (voluntarily) pay more. The downside is that we should be very careful with this model to make sure that those donations do not have strings attached to secure the integrity of journalism.\n\n\\- Freemium models. Public-interest news should be free (world news, national news). Entertainment news (fashion, sports) can be paywalled since it is not in the public interest to know what happened to (insert name of celebrity). However, this comes with a risk of journalism moving a lot of resources to entertainment news in order to grab subscribers.\n\n\\- If journalism is a basic service, so it should not be a commercial enterprise. As seen in the USA, commercial journalism has led to the production of \"news\" that people want to see, as opposed to news that people should actually know. If we publicly fund schools, we can also publicly fund journalism. Of course, there is the risk and the fear that publicly funded journalism is going to lead to state-controlled media, so safeguards have to be put in place.",

This seems really difficult, I think.\n\nMy personal belief is that the root cause problem isn't consent or cost, but the lack of a widely adopted solution for online micropayments. If payments on the order of 0.10 EUR can be processed without excessive fees, if such payment systems were integrated into browsers and could be authorized with a single click, if kids could easily pay pocket money into that system, then there is a straightforward path for implementing consent-or-pay solutions in an obviously compliant manner.",

In Chrome, select the \"Application\" tab, then select a storage type such as \"Cookies\" or \"Local storage\" and then select the domain under which data is stored. In Firefox, select the \"Storage\" tab, then select the storage type + domain.\n* The cookies are displayed in a table with name, value, the domain and path that determine their scope, and metadata such as expiry, HttpOnly, and so on.

For example, toggling dark mode of a website might store the preference as a cookie.\n\nUsing a web browser instead of a dedicated scanning tool has the advantage that you can see *exactly* what is going on with the site, because you're actually a user. The disadvantage is that the information you get is targeted at web developers, and can be difficult to interpret. Dedicated scanning tools might be able to explain/attribute well-known cookies. For example, the cookie called `_ga` is typically set by Google Analytics.\n\nRemember that the ePrivacy rules on cookies aren't actually about cookies – they are about accessing or storing information on the end user's device, unless that access or storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user. So consider using the browser's developer tools to also look at other kind of storage, for example LocalStorage or IndexedDB.",

A few week ago, using the browser development tools (chrome and safari) I noticed that the presence of fifteen or more cookies, while at other times they seemed to disappear completely. This discrepancy also occurs when I check from different devices and can persist for weeks despite the cookie expiration date being years. I have tried to scan the site with various cookie scanning tools but can only detect one cookie and other times none. Recently, I asked the support of my hosting service to run a check, they identified about twenty cookies, all of which disappeared within a few minutes. I requested a re-verification today and they only found one. I even changed my browser settings to accept all cookies as I thought it was my problem, but that didn't solve the mystery of these fluctuations. I no longer know which cookies to include in the privacy policy at this point. Does anyone have any idea what I can do to fix it? A thousand thanks.",

Legitimate interest can be just as valid. On a surface level, the difference is that \"legitimate interest\" is opt-out rather than opt-in.\n\nMost companies would revel in this, because it means users would need to actively decline legitimate interest for their data not to be processed.\n\nHowever, the ePrivacy directive states that the placing of cookies and similar technologies on a user's device requires consent. So there needs to be consent involved in the cookie banners as well, for a lot of the processing to be possible. This even applies to processing where no personal data is involved, as it's the cookie itself you consent to. No legitimate interest allowed here.\n\nSo if it's possible to process user personal data without the use of technologies as cookies, legitimate interest should theoretically be a valid option and so companies will rely on this when the user does not consent.\n\nAs for its validity, well... there are a lot of things companies use the data for, and a lot of complicated processes and interests involved. It's doubtful that a user can even be considered \"adequately informed\" as per their rights, just reading away in the cookie banner. It's also doubtful whether it's clear to the user that \"legitimate interest\" is even a thing, and what it even entails. Then again, what else could companies rely on? Consent *also* requires the user to be properly informed, so if it's still too complicated for the average person, then would that even be an option? It's an ongoing debate and I do expect there will be a lot of changes in the coming years one way or the other.\n\nBut the TL;DR is this:\n\nLegitimate Interest is the legal purpose companies rely on when consent is out of the question, for any processing that does not explicitly require consent.",

So if the UI contains means of sending this along to other vendors, then they can effectively stop processing too. This is where it's important to have a set standard for processing, as you'd want the consent/legitimate interest to be the same across all involved vendors. Hence frameworks like [TCF](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/) which standardises the legal texts, the purposes, etc.\n\nHowever, again, there's been a lot of legal uncertainty involved with the TCF alone.

There's an older EU law called the ePrivacy directive (the “cookie law”) that essentially said: cookies are small files stored on the end user's computer. Software shouldn't freely access the files on your computer, unless it's strictly necessary for a service you explicitly requested, or if you've given your consent. That's quite reasonable by itself. Then GDPR came along, and re-defined what “consent” means. Originally, it was planned to update ePrivacy to account for these changes, but agreement couldn't be reached in time (and the update is *still* not done).\n\nSo we have a weird combination of strict ePrivacy requirements (cookies usually require consent) and strict GDPR definitions (consent must be freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous and must involve a statement or clear affirmative action). Usually, GDPR is fairly flexible, but this specific combination lacks any nuance – not all cookies are equally problematic. For example, a cookie used to count the numbers of visitors to a page is far less sensitive than a cookie used for tracking you across different web sites in order to create an ad targeting profile.\n\nI hope that the ePrivacy regulation will be done soon so that the cookie law falls in line with the more flexible GDPR approach. But in the meanwhile:\n\n* Many sites manipulate and trick you in order to get you to click “accept all”. I won't let them win, and will try extra hard to decline consent, or to ignore and circumvent them.\n* Practicing digital self-defense prevents many problematic aspects of cookies on a technical levels. Disable third-party cookies in your browser settings. Firefox has much stronger privacy controls than Chrome, e.g. with its “Enhanced Tracking Protection” feature which you should enable in all tabs.

It isn't being asked about in the post, nor is it discussed anywhere in this thread. Apart from your post - where you provide a very thorough and thoughtful response, although not asked for by OP.\n\nAnd in this thread I also don't see how it is about feelings regarding said requirements, the only thing that is mentioned by OP is that they find cookie *notices* annoying, and whether someone is ever rushed and pushes accepts. This doesn't without any further information relate to cookie consent requirements at all. A cookie notice can also just be, simply a cookie notice, without asking consent for anything under ePrivacy, but simply to comply with information obligations. Accepting is not the same thing as consent, and consent can't be implied from any information out of this thread.\n\n>This subreddit is about GDPR (and related regulation), not about legal advice.

Discussions about GDPR, ePrivacy or any other law that is within scope automatically is a legal discussion; it is about the law and thus a legal discussion.\n\nThis post simply isn't about any law, it's only asking about feelings; and not even feelings about consent requirements, simply feelings.\n\nI take your point about the VPN, but I do not agree that this question is related to the European regulatory environment.

Furthermore, from what I gather from OP with the exact same post in other subreddits is really just that OP is looking for a solution such as an browser plugin that blocks them, is just another pointer that it is out of scope. \n\nI get your reasoning in regards to how you moderate the subreddit, but voting simply is not a good way of measuring the community's preferences. At the time of writing my comment has -12 points, it could very well be that 20 people upvoted it and 32 people downvoted it. It's not an objective way of measurement in my opinion.\n\nIn my opinion, posts should be substantive, not low effort. That together with the fact that it is not, or merely borderline within scope should be enough for deletion.\n\nBut you are the moderator, and I am not.

Ces mesures sont dans de nombreux cas indispensables au bon fonctionnement du site ou de l’application et donc à la fourniture du service. En conséquence, la Commission considère que les traceurs dont la finalité se limite à la mesure de l’audience du site ou de l’application, pour répondre à différents besoins (mesure des performances, détection de problèmes de navigation, optimisation des performances techniques ou de l’ergonomie, estimation de la puissance des serveurs nécessaires, analyse des contenus consultés, etc.) sont strictement nécessaires au fonctionnement et aux opérations d’administration courante d’un site web ou d’une application et ne sont donc pas soumis, en application de l’article 82 de la loi « Informatique et Libertés », à l’obligation légale de recueil préalable du consentement de l’internaute. \n\n51. Afin de se limiter à ce qui est strictement nécessaire à la fourniture du service, la Commission souligne que ces traceurs doivent avoir une finalité strictement limitée à la seule mesure de l’audience sur le site ou l’application pour le compte exclusif de l’éditeur. Ces traceurs ne doivent notamment pas permettre le suivi global de la navigation de la personne utilisant différentes applications ou naviguant sur différents sites web. De même, ces traceurs doivent uniquement servir à produire des données statistiques anonymes, et les données à caractère personnel collectées ne peuvent être recoupées avec d’autres traitements ni transmises à des tiers, ces différentes opérations n’étant pas non plus nécessaires au fonctionnement du service.",

Also no third party scripts are used or any cdn‘s are linked.\n\n\nDo I need to inform my visitors that I do not use any cookies? I think the only personal data that gets stored are the IP addresses in the server logs of my webhoster, but I assume that is not avoidable and I have no control over that.\n\n\nAlso in near future I plan to store a language preference in a cookie to display the website in the correct language, from what I understood this is a functional cookie. I assume if I have that I must have a cookie policy banner but there would be no opt-out as I only have one functional cookie?",

Else your privacy policy would be endless, wouldn't it?\n\nYou still have to write a privacy policy about the personal data you process (e.g. the IP address, as you mentioned yourself) though.\n\n>I assume if I have that I must have a cookie policy banner but there would be no opt-out as I only have one functional cookie?\n\nNo, if you only use essential/strictly necessary cookies you don't need a banner, just mention them in your privacy policy.\\\nA banner is required only if you rely on consent, so for non essential cookies. And it would then be opt-in, not opt-out. You could maybe also use one if you rely on legitimate interest, but then it would be opt-out.\n\nDo note that a language preference cookie does not seem to meet the PECR definition of 'strictly necessary' (at least that's what ICO [appears to say](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-the-rules-on-cookies-and-similar-technologies/#rules9)), so you would still require consent.\\\nAnd if you require consent, it means you must allow users to refuse without being negatively impacted, which means your website must be able to work without that cookie and still display content in the language of their choosing.\n\nI recommend relying on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language instead. That way you don't need to store data on the device and your website is in the preferred language of the user out of the box.",

We do have guidelines and court decisions that explain what counts as personal data. Based on such information, it is safe to say that IP addresses should generally be treated as personal data, unless it is clear that the IP address does not relate to an identifiable data subject (for example, internal IPs in a compute cluster).",

The default browser configuration (e.g. that cookies may be set) is not consent for a specific site to set specific cookies for specific purposes. Thus, actually compliant cookie management solutions allow the visitor to accept or reject cookies for specific purposes. E.g. I might consent to cookies for convenience features and analytics, while rejecting cookies for ad targeting purposes.\n\nIn any case, cookies must be opt-in: they can only be set *after* the visitor has given their consent. The exception to this are cookies that are strictly necessary for providing the service explicitly requested by the user. For example, using a cookie to store contents of a “shopping cart” is perfectly fine since that's strictly necessary for a webshop to work – but ads are not strictly necessary.\n\nBecause many sites are not compliant with GDPR and ePrivacy, I recommend taking additional precautions on your own.

        "selftext": "Hello! I'm working on a project focusing about the legal side of webpage cookie usage in the EU. I know that cookies containing information that might identify a user are considered personal data, and therefore require a consent and proper handling.\n\nThere are a few things I don't understand though, and I couldn't find an answer online - most webpages just talk generally about how bad third party cookies are, without going into details.\n\n1. I visit a website and a .doubleclick.com cookie is loaded into my browser. It contains a string of random letters. How can I prove that it's personal data? (Edit: example of a doubleclick cookie taken out of a recorded HAR file: [https://pastebin.com/AJiEuP6v](https://pastebin.com/AJiEuP6v))\n2. How do tracking cookies exactly work? How does doubleclick know which cookies to load into my browser? Are any files from my browser sent back to doubleclick?\n\nI'd highly appreciate answers or links to useful resources. Thanks in advance!",

For instance, the Google Analytics cookies are first party, meaning they're set by the website provider. But Google Analytics itself is a third party tool using Google Servers to store data, so Google becomes a processor in that regard.\n\nAlso, regarding the GA cookies: Statistics is *not* a strictly necessary purpose in the legal cookie sense, though some choose to ignore this if it's simple, website statistics. However, a big point against this would be that Google Analytics has recently been put into question by certain DPA's as not being compliant in regards to third country transfers. So if the website wanted to say \"it's just simple statistics\" the very fact that they're using GA is an argument against this.\n\nHowever: Legitimate Interest is an \"opt-out\" option, as consent is not factored here. It's fine to have these boxes pre-checked, assuming everything else about it is legal. It does, however, seem like the consent solution is built around the TCF, which has recently also been ousted by the Belgian DPA, so there's a lot of legal uncertainty there as well.",

Hell, IMO buttons such as 'accept all' are violating GDPR if:\n- the user can click them without having to see the list of third-parties and whatnot (because they cannot give informed consent until then)\n- the user cannot chose which third-parties to allow and must consent to all in bulk (meaning consent is not specific)\n\nSo yeah, IMO to comply with GDPR you need a big ass cookie modal/panel with a list of all your 142 third-party 'partners' with a link to their privacy policy and the user must be able to pick what he wants to consent to. Problem:\n- that's annoying as hell, your user is here for your service/content, not for this shit, that's why solutions like uBlock Origin are so popular\n- to not make it annoying as hell you can hide the modal/panel until the user clicks on it, but as I said earlier it means 99% of your users won't even glance at it, because in the end they don't need nor want your tracking, you do",

I'm not sure there's explicit official guidance, but generally I treat \"service\" as pretty fine-grained.

Most users don't use the chat service, you can't load cookies for a chat service *until* the user takes an affirmative action towards using the chat service (like clicking the \"Chat\" link).\n\nFollowing this logic, the \"default\" values for cookies should be to not exist, as opposed to existing with a null-ish value.

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit, could really use your help on a UK issue.\n\nDuring lockdown I helped a local small restaurant set up a Squarespace website so they could offer click and collect to customers. I cannot be certain that I enabled Squarespace's 'show cookie banner' when I did and now an unhappy customer (that placed a click and collect order thinking it was for delivery and who has since been refunded) has been in touch demanding hundreds of pounds to compensate them for the 'loss of control' of their personal data and for the distress it has caused, and if the restaurant doesn't pay the amount they're asking for they're going to involve solicitors.\n\nI can accept that if the customer was not notified about cookies and able to decline them via a suitable banner that they have a case technically, but the cookies in question are the out of the box connection to Google Analytics, plus YouTube for an embedded video and the 1-2 that Squarespace set during the session, there isn't anything particularly 'personal' or sensitive to the level they imply in their claim and it feels out of proportion.\n\nI am now extremely nervous about what happens next - if the restaurant didn't agree to the financial demand that has been made and lawyers did get involved, then does the ICO or whoever governs such things take a completely black and white approach and treat this business with the same level of punishment as, say, a large corporate? Or do they consider the severity of the case in question and assess the punishment from there? I am having trouble finding case studies and examples.\n\nI appreciate this is a GDPR subreddit and that a significant proportion of readers will take the customer's stance on this, but if anybody can objectively recommend what to do next or what outcome I should realistically expect I'd really appreciate it.\n\nIs it more likely a warning and being told to make sure it doesn't happen again, or more likely a hefty fine, or something in between?\n\nNeedless to say, the 'show cookie banner' setting is now definitely switched on properly!

It doesn't even matter if that information is personal data.\n\nCookies that are needed for securely running the site and for providing the features used by the user are sometimes called “functional” cookies, but that is not a term used by the law itself. Typical examples for cookies that might not need consent include rate limiting cookies, CSRF tokens, session cookies for logged-in users, remembering user preferences like cookie consent status, language, or theme, and features like shopping carts.\n\nIn the web browser, examples of technologies for accessing or storing information on the device include cookies, LocalStorage, but also other JavaScript APIs and fingerprinting techniques.\n\nIn mobile apps, there are generally far more ways to access information on the device or to store info on the device. Examples include files or databases, but also advertising IDs, cameras, or the APIs provided by the operating system. The operating system might force you to ask for consent for some of those (e.g. permissions for location data or camera), but that doesn't affect your legal obligations.\n\nSo I think your colleague is mostly wrong, with a bit of truth. The consent requirements are exactly the same on mobile and web. If you'd need consent on web, you'd definitely need consent on mobile when using similar technologies. However, it is entirely feasible that your app might only access/store data as strictly necessary to provide the service explicitly requested by the user, so that no consent would be needed.",

Without session cookies, you'd have to enter your username and password every single time you wanted to load a page or subpage.

The **session cookie** is the \"keep this\" half, and is kept by your browser. The number on it is your **session ID**. The other half of the ticket, Facebook keeps: they stamp it with an expiration date (today + 30 days, for example), and staple it to your account.\n\nThe next time you access Facebook, instead of punching in your password again, your browser auto-presents the session cookie (your raffle ticket). Facebook sees a matching ticket in its database, confirms your identity, pulls up your account, and hands you the webpage you asked for, filled with information specific to your user. This works until the ticket expires, or you sign out (rip the ticket up). In that case, you'll need to prove your identity again to make a new session cookie.\n\nWithout a way to prove your identity, the only information Facebook could provide you with is public information.",

If you don't want the cookie, it is not technically possible for you to login to a site.\n\nBTW, they don't store your password in a cookie.  The cookie will store a giant random number.  In the site, they will have a database entry saying something akin to <user, valid Y|N, large_number>.  When your browser loads a page, it sends the cookies along via fields in the HTTP request.

                "body": "The “cookie law” provides for three different reasons why a website may store cookies or store/access data on your device using similar technologies:\n\n* The storage is technically necessary. For example, website data may be cached for better efficiency.\n* The storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by you. For example, cookies to store preferences or session cookies are strictly necessary.\n* You have given your consent.\n\nFor strictly necessary cookies, you don't have to be asked for consent. Without these cookies the site will break, so it's acceptable to block your access should you disable these.\n\nBut when cookies shall be set on the basis of consent, this consent must be freely given. Art 7(4) GDPR says that consent is typically not freely given if the website makes access to a service conditional on consent. This is also what that DPA guy on the phone said to you.\n\nFacebook is pretty bad about this. When you visit a Facebook property, you're asked to accept cookies:\n\n[Fig 1: Instagram cookie banner level 1.](https://imgur.com/Fp32V3x.png)\n\nNo “reject non-essential” option is given.\n\n[Fig 2: Instagram cookie banner level 2.](https://i.imgur.com/0hlUZEF.png)\n\nThe banner explains that some cookies are essential. However, it also says that cookies are used for showing relevant ads, which is not strictly necessary for the service that I requested (viewing a profile). The only control is over third-party cookies, which is probably not sufficient.  \nBelow the fold, links point to browser cookie management features such as Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection. Again, probably not sufficient: the data controller cannot outsource the responsibility for consent management to third parties.\n\nIn my opinion, FB's cookie banner is not compliant because FB wants to set cookies that are not strictly necessary for a service requested by the user, without obtaining valid consent. The “accept all” button fails to achieve freely given consent because there is literally no option (other than removing the banner using browser developer tools).\n\nUnfortunately, the Irish Data Protection Commission is the primary regulator for Facebook, and they're not exactly cracking down on FB.\n\nI think that Reddit's cookie banner does a much better job and offers a real choice:\n\n[Fig 3: Reddit cookie banner level 1.](https://i.imgur.com/6ylgLG5.png)\n\nA “reject non-essential” option is directly given, which is very good.\n\nReddit also has a pretty reasonable [cookie notice](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/cookie-notice) ([permalink](https://web.archive.org/web/20211027151454/https://www.redditinc.com/policies/cookie-notice)) that clearly lists which strictly necessary cookies will be set, and for which purposes.",

                "body": "The cited WP 29 guidelines are from 2007. Since then, a lot has happened. Especially the research on identifiability has made some important advances around that time. The old Data Protection Directive on which these guidelines are based are even older, and predate important scientific results.\n\nSo while those WP 29 guidelines are important and well-reasoned, they are not particularly authoritative regarding GDPR.\n\nWhile the DPD and GDPR share a lot of text, there are also some important differences. E.g. the GDPR mentions “singling out” as an example of identifying someone. The GDPR added “online identifier” as an example of an identifier.\n\nI interpret this as meaning that if you can single out an individual, that data subject is identifiable. A random identifier in a cookie clearly makes it possible to single out an individual. If two HTTP requests have the same cookie value, that implies they are from the same browser session, thus most likely from the same person. Similarly, IP addresses allow singling out in most cases (except in case of massive NAT deployments, e.g. IP addresses that connect a large intranet). These IP addresses or cookie identifiers are at the very least *pseudonyms* of the data subjects – but still personal.\n\nI note that my interpretation is in some contraction with the WP136 document, especially example 13. But that example has many additional aspects that ensure a level of anonymity. I don't think any DPAs or courts still doubt that cookie identifiers or IP addresses can constitute personal data.\n\nThe reference to “another person” is important in case the data is shared with others, or even published. If that data is anonymous, then *no one* who gets the data will be able to identify data subjects. If someone else can combine the data with additional data that allows re-identification, the data is not anonymous. So a data controller can't claim “*I* can't identify data subjects, so it's anonymous” and sell the “anonymous” data to others. In this context, the WP136 document also considers the storage duration – if the data is kept for a long time, future developments could make re-identification possible.",

                "body": "In the following, I will first discuss the Breyer ruling which introduces this “legal means” concept. I find that it is far broader than generally summarized. Subsequently, I will provide an argument that while Breyer establishes a lower bound on identifiability through IP addresses, its line of argument is not necessary under the GDPR: IP addresses are likely to be personal data regardless of legal means to obtain additional information. In particular, I will discuss the concept of “online identifiers” in more detail, will remark upon “singling out”, and will show that “reasonably likely to be used” should be interpreted broadly, excluding only means that are unreasonable. I finish with a remark on the ICO guide.\n\n## Discussion of the Breyer ruling\n\nTo my knowledge, there have not been any more recent ECJ rulings on identifiability through IP addresses than the Breyer ruling you're citing. That ruling is subsequently cited in more recent cases such as the Opinion of the Advocate General in the Fashion ID case, but there just to note that IP addresses *can be* personal data. Whether an IP address *is* personal data in that context would be for a lower court to decide, which hasn't done so yet.\n\nSpecifically, the judgement in Breyer mentions that if the data controller is reasonably likely to have means that allow them to combine non-identifying data with other data that allows identification, then this data is personal data. Here, the court notes that there would be such means:\n\n>  German law does not allow the internet service provider to transmit directly to the online media services provider the additional data necessary for the identification of the data subject[. However], in the event of cyber attacks legal channels exist so that the online media services provider is able to contact the competent authority, so that the latter can take the steps necessary to obtain that information from the internet service provider and to bring criminal proceedings.\n>\n> Thus, it appears that the online media services provider has the means which may likely reasonably be used in order to identify the data subject, with the assistance of other persons, namely the competent authority and the internet service provider, on the basis of the IP addresses stored.\n\nNote that this finding is in no way contingent on the “online media services provider” being the German government. It is also not necessary for identifiability that the data controller would receive the additional information itself. In the court's finding, it is sufficient if the re-identification is performed by a “competent authority”.\n\n## Limits of the Breyer ruling in light of changes between the DPD and GDPR\n\nHowever, I believe that the Breyer judgement is not entirely applicable under the GDPR. To be clear: it shows a lower bound on identifiability. If such legal means exist, the IP address is identifiable. This doesn't preclude that the IP address could also be identifying without such legal means.\n\nThe Breyer judgement says:\n\n> a dynamic IP address does not constitute information relating to an ‘identified natural person’, since such an address does not directly reveal the identity of the natural person who owns the computer from which a website was accessed, or that of another person who might use that computer.\n\n(and later discusses whether an IP address can be *indirectly identifying*, reaching the conclusion above.)\n\nI think this part is no longer as applicable, or at least misleading. IP addresses can be personal data without directly revealing the identity of a natural person.\n\n**First**, the GDPR explicitly added that **online identifiers** are an example of personal data. There is to date no case law on this term, so we only have Recital 30 to go on:\n\n> Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them.\n\nBoth “cookie identifiers” and “internet protocol addresses” are explicitly called out as examples of online identifiers. While there are obviously many cookie contents and IP addresses that are clearly not personal data, I think we should assume by default that they are at least indirectly identifying. It would be up to the data controller to demonstrate the opposite in the context of their processing activities.\n\n**Second**, the GDPR added “**singling out**” as an example of identification. You disagree with me on the interpretation of this term, but I think the GDPR consistently takes a comparatively wide view of identifiability. Let's look at Recital 26 again:\n\n> To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments.\n\nBoth the “singling out” and “To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely …” parts were added in the GDPR, and were not present in the old Data Protection Directive on which Breyer was based. There are some examples given as objective **factors that affect reasonableness**. These do not allow an overly narrow interpretation, instead requiring us to even consider future “technological developments”.\n\nI think this mandates a rather wide and risk-aware approach to identifiability, while merely excluding *unreasonable* scenarios like “a supervillain builds a $100M supercomputer cluster to crack the encryption” or “an ISP employee accidentally lost printouts with customer records in the back-alley behind a bar, where the data controller finds them and uses them for re-identification”. The referenced ICO guidance excludes scenarios with a “slight hypothetical possibility”. Prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or outright unlikely means do not have to be considered. However, the current intentions of the data controller would not seem to be a factor, e.g. if the controller merely intends to not use available techniques that would reasonably allow identification.\n\n## Regarding the ICO guide\n\nI agree that the same information can be personal data when processed for one purpose, and non-personal when processed for other purposes. However, this should not generally be argued over the “identified or identifiable” aspect, but over the “relating to [a] data subject” part. Note that those ICO guidelines also consider a data subject directly identified or identifiable if “you can distinguish an individual from other individuals”, i.e. if you're able to single out a subject. It is not necessary to know the data subject's real-world identity such as their name.",

If the user hasn't indicated their preferences, you do not have consent. So by default, “do nothing” and “decline consent” should have equivalent effect. You must not prevent access to a user who doesn't want to consent. If you block scrolling, you can't already load stuff in the background that would need consent.\n\n2. Most ad networks still require cookies or similar technologies in order to measure click rates and to prevent ad fraud. Such ad networks will require consent even when just showing non-personalized ads.\n\nAlso, you may want to consider the impact of blocking user interactions depending on the purpose of the page. For example, adding such friction on a landing page where you are trying to sell a product would be extremely unwise.

If so, this should mean that if you fail to untick the legitimate interest boxes on cookie consent banners, but you have consent boxes unticked by default, no data could be collected. But then, if the answer is no, what is the use of providing this legitimate interest option from the get-go? \n\nDoes anyone here know whether this is the case and no data will be collected (as would be compliant with existing regulation), or are cookie banner providers actually using it as an alternative to consent?

If something looks problematic on a website's cookie banner, a very realistic possibility is that they done goofed and it's actually in violation of GDPR or ePD.\n\nHaving seen how the sausage gets made, there are a variety of contributing factors. A) companies assign the drafting or review of policies to their existing roster of lawyers which does not include relevant expertise, so it's someone who is out of their depth. B) after making a general policy, decision-making about some of the details gets handed down the chain to either a manager or consultant who projects more confidence than competence. C) There is a lot of difference to emulating peer companies, resulting in the blind leading the blind, or to the default settings for management tools, which for a variety of reasons actually default to non-compliance.\n\nLegitimate Interest is not a basis for cookie consent. Also the idea of \"a fail-safe option to consent\" is ill-founded. If consent is being asked for, that means that denying/withdrawing consent results in the data not being processed. It is a violation of GDPR to claim another Legal Basis when the user does not consent. \n\nAs a practical matter, even when the company *intends* not to collect data based on the user's settings, it's a bit of a coinflip on whether they successfully stop themselves from collecting the data.

That is true but irrelevant to the cookie being essential or not.\n\n2) LI is never an acceptable legal basis for cookies. In my experience, it is almost never used as a legal basis for cookies. You often see websites ignoring the user consent or dropping cookies before consent is given but never websites exposing LI for cookies.\n\nI know the cookie banner vendors out there pretty well and they would not support cookies based on LI for EU by default. Some of them might allow their clients to do it if they want but vendors will usually make it pretty clear that it's not acceptable. At the end of the day, the responsibility is with the client so the cookie banner vendors will allow non compliant configurations to happen.\n\n3) LI can be used for other data processing for websites/apps and is therefore offered for non-cookie based purposes pretty often.",

Indeed, this system could affect the freedom of consent, required by the GDPR.\n\n>In the decision of June 19, 2020, the Council of State ruled that the requirement for \"free\" consent could not, however, justify a general ban on the practice of \"walls of tracers\": the freedom of consent of individuals must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account, in particular, the existence of a real and satisfactory alternative offered in case of refusal of cookies. To take the most common example, the fact that an online press publisher makes access to its content conditional either on the acceptance of advertising cookies that contribute to the remuneration of its service, or on the payment of a reasonable sum of money, is not prohibited in principle, if the latter allows access to an equivalent version of the site in terms of content and totally devoid of advertising cookies Other elements, such as the dominant position of the site, may lead to the illegality of certain \"walls of cookies\".\n\n>The CNIL, which has already taken this latest decision into account in its guidelines, will continue its analysis in light of the Conseil d'Etat's ( State Council ) ruling to determine the cases justifying the presence of a wall of trackers in light of the alternatives available to the individual. The future European regulation known as \"e-privacy\", currently being drafted, could contribute to setting more precise rules in this area.\n\nSource - in French [CNIL](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookie-walls-et-monetisation-des-donnees-personnelles-les-enjeux-juridiques-et-ethiques#)",

This is generally correct, especially taking into account the later Fashion ID case.\n\n* The Law.SE question is specifically about cookie consent. In the Law.SE answer (which I wrote), I discussed who the data controller is with regards to the setting of cookies. Taking into account the Fashion ID case, I come to the conclusion that the embedding site and the embed provider are likely joint controllers. So while the embed provider is definitely responsible for cookie consent, the embedding site might also be responsible for managing consent.\n\nIn any case, cookies are a bit of red herring. You need a legal basis for sharing visitor data with the embed provider. This legal basis will typically be consent. That means:\n\n* instead of showing the embed, show a placeholder\n* only load the embed after the visitor has given their informed consent\n* the visitor should be aware that the embed is outside of your control, who the other data controller is (e.g. Youtube), that they might set cookies, and that the data might be transferred into the US.\n\nI've screenshotted a fairly good solution in [this Law.SE answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56006).

                "body": "EU law generally relies on the country of origin principle: your member state passes laws that are compliant with EU directives, so you're good if you comply with those laws. This doesn't just apply to e-commerce aspects (such as subtle differences between consumer rights) but also to aspects related to the ePrivacy Directive, such as cookies.\n\nThe catch is that not all laws that are on the books are valid. While a national law can clearly explain that creating statistics from traffic data is allowed, the ePrivacy directive does not give EU members the option to allow analytics cookies without consent. From your description, the law seems to clarify the former and doesn't do the latter. So that just seems to be a clarification of EU-wide rules, not an exemption specific to Italy. \n\nSpecifically:\n\n> we don't need to use a cookie prior consent banner if we only use Analytics in anonymous mode\n\nCorrect. The ePrivacy Directive (and implementing laws) mandate that you obtain consent before you store or access information (such as cookies) on the end user's device, unless the access is *strictly necessary* to perform a service *explicitly requested* by the user. Analytics only need consent to the degree that they involve such client-side storage or if they involve non-anonymous traffic data. ePrivacy explicitly allows you to use traffic data as long as it's made anonymous.\n\nCareful: typical analytics solution collect *a lot* of data, which may amount to an unique fingerprint. True anonymity is difficult to achieve without aggregate statistics.\n\n> there is a specific law that says you need to show in the cookie banner which kind of cookie categories you want to accept and give consent.\n\nCorrect, but this is a core feature of consent as defined by the GDPR (and thus applies EU-wide). Consent must be specific to a purpose, so the visitor must be able to give consent to one purpose/category but to withhold consent for another. Consent must also be informed, which means that you must give an appropriate level of information about what you're asking consent for.\n\nFor EU-wide guidance on consent, consider reading the [EDPB guidelines 05/2020 on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en) (PDF, about 30 pages).",

As such, the actual wording of the law is harmonised across all member states and ancillary members. Member states *can* \"gold plate\" laws by adding additional requirements (e.g. countries such as Spain and Germany have additional requirements for processing employee data).\n\n2. **Countries can take a different approach to GDPR, but this is lead by the guidance issued by the relevant DPAs and more broadly local courts** - Since there is still much up to interpretation, local DPAs and courts may make slightly different interpretations when it coems to issuing guidance and enforcing GDPR.\n\n3. **GDPR does not contain specific provisions on cookies** - Cookie requirements are contained in the e-Privacy directive. This, as opposed to a Regulation, is an EU legal act which *does* need to be implemented at a local level (e.g. see UK's PECR). This is why there are many different approaches to cookie walls in the EU, it simply isn't harmonised. GDPR does impact cookies, and you are correct in this part, but only insofar as the definition of \"explicit consent\" which can still be tempered by DPA guidance.\n\n4. **The CJEU ruling only requires that consent is not automatically gathered** - The CJEU is sensitive to the fact that the EDPB and local DPAs have primacy when it comes to interpertation and enforcement of data protection laws across the EU. As such, this ruling only makes a minor impact on the interpretation of EU cookie requirements. Rather than requiring \"unchecked checkboxes\", the ruling only requires that consent is not automatic. This is compatible with the AEPD advice as cookies are not automatically set when the cookie banner appears - cookies will only be set when a user clicks anywhere on the website other than the link which takes them to the cookie options page.\n\n\nThis is an area of mass confusion and interpretation, mainly because we have two pieces of EU privacy law which do not create a clear image of how we should act. The long awaited e-Privacy Regulation, which was supposed to be published alongside GDPR, is taking a long time to be implemented. When it is, it should harmonise this area of law and restore clarity.",

The German legal situation is a bit murky, but the consent requirement has recently been clarified and re-emphasised in the ECJ's (EuGH) Planet49 case. Consent means opt-in, and must be freely given. You cannot use non-necessary cookies without consent, and you must also make it possible to decline or withdraw consent. Merely showing an “agree” button is not sufficient.\n\nWhereas Cloudflare can be your data processor, services like Giphy cannot (I presume). When sending user data to those third party services through embeds, you need an appropriate legal basis. At least in Germany, it has become somewhat customary to put embeds like videos or tweets behind a consent wall: instead of the embed, a message asking for consent is shown. When consent is given, the actual embed is loaded (and this preference is remembered in a cookie).\n\nThe necessary parts of a privacy policy are largely enumerated by GDPR Art 13 & 15. Note that you need to explain\n\n* what kinds of data processors you use (e.g. content delivery networks like Cloudflare),\n* what the purposes and legal bases of processing are (e.g. a legitimate interest to ensure the security of the site, and consent to load third party embeds),\n* whether/how data is transferred to non-EU countries (e.g. to the US due to using Cloudflare, under the basis of an adequacy decision because Cloudflare maintains a Privacy Shield certification).",

It is sufficient to explain in broad terms what processing you do (like using cookies) and what the purposes of processing are (like securing the site). Larger data controllers need to create an internal Records of Processing document that explicitly discusses which kind of processing activity is done for what purpose and under which legal basis.\n* The issue with embedded content is not primarily that the embed may set cookies, but that the embed provider can track users (or more generally: process personal data of your visitors). You need a legal basis for this *sharing* with third party providers.\n   * I don't remember the name right now, but there was a case that concluded that website operators are jointly responsible for Facebook's use of data when they embed a Facebook “like button”.\n   * Therefore, the standard solution is to only load embeds when explicitly requested by the user.\n* If Cloudflare is your data processor, Cloudflare's servers are effectively your servers. \n   * You do not need a legal basis for using Cloudflare.\n   * But you do need to explain why you are allowed to transfer data into the US.\n\nWhile striving for compliance is good, it's not necessary to go overboard.

Art 32 does mandate that certain kinds of measures are considered, e.g. pseudonymisation, encryption, backups, and security evaluations. These concepts are not specific to backend stuff, and could also apply to frontend. For example, encryption could involve usage of HTTPS, HSTS, and the Secure flag on cookies, or even E2E encryption.\n\nWhat is important is that the measures are *appropriate* (Art 32). What is appropriate depends on the state of the art, but also on the risks to data subjects. A CSP is definitely state of the art, but it would be fairly useless e.g. on a static site or on a site that otherwise prevents XSS. E.g. when loading scripts from third party domains, an alternative to CSP could be to use subresource integrity. It is the job of the controller and processor to figure out which measures are appropriate.\n\neIDAS only applies to very specific processing activities, namely identification schemes and trust services. Just like the GDPR, the eIDAS directive does not impose specific technological requirements, though national regulations might.",

                "body": "This subreddit (OP included) is once again failing to draw distinctions in the regulatory regimes which legitimate interest is relevant which adds to this confusion. \n\nIt’s important to recognise that GDPR is a lex generalis, in that it applies where a law covering specific scenarios doesn’t exist. Where a lex specialis exists, such as the ePrivacy Directive, GDPR either does not apply or can be used to provide definitions or context.\n\nThe ePrivacy Directive regulates a number of things, but most commonly relevant to GDPR practitioners and marketers are the rules on direct electronic marketing and cookies. The ePD is not concerned with the processing of personal data, it is only concerned with the requirements for certain activities. \n\nTo make clear, the ePD never mentions legitimate interest because it is not relevant to any of the activities for the scope of the ePD. The ePD makes clear that an activity either requires consent or it does not require consent. The processing of personal data is secondary assessment, which I cover below.\n\nFor direct electronic marketing (marketing communication by any electronic medium (email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn messages, etc)), the sender is required to get consent from an individual subscriber. Consent is not defined in the ePD, so the lex generalis effect of GDPR kicks in and provides the definition by way of Articles 4 & 7.\n\nAn individual subscriber is any individual, really. In the UK, it’s been decided to mean customers in the B2C sense but also sole traders.\n\nSo there are two elements to sending marketing emails to individual subscribers:\n\n- ePD: Do I have the consent required to send this email? \n- GDPR: What is my lawful basis for the processing of the personal data for marketing purposes?\n\nIf you’re getting consent to send marketing email (ePD) and you’re statement is clear that the processing of the personal data is for the purposes of sending direct marketing, then your lawful basis (GDPR) is likely going to be consent, but you’re free to choose your most appropriate. It’s important to remember that these are two separate requirements, but it is standard practice to obtain them at the same time. A purist would say that you would need to get consent to comply with the ePD separately to the consent for personal data processing. I am pragmatist, not a purist. \n\nB2B direct electronic marketing is not discussed in the ePD therefore no such consent requirement exists. B2B contacts can be a little bit of a minefield because you need to determine whether you’re marketing to the address/person as an individual or as a business function. This means hello@business.com is free game as there is no ePD requirement for B2B direct marketing AND because the email is not personal data you don’t need a GDPR lawful basis either, but person@business.com is something you’ll need to assess whether it falls inside or outside of the ePD.\n\nThe added complication for person@business.com is that the email is personal data (because it has the person’s name and their place of work) which means there’s both an assessment of whether you need consent to send the email because ePD requires AND a separate consideration of whether you have a lawful basis for processing personal data. \n\nUnlike the individual subscriber above, your requirement are for a B2B which falls outside of ePD:\n\n- ePD does not require consent\n- what is my lawful basis (GDPR) for processing the personal data of person@business.com?\n\nYou don’t need consent for ePD purposes in this example, so you may not have even interacted with the person, but instead found their details online, via a third party, etc. So it would be perfectly fair to do a legitimate interest assessment to see if LI is suitable for sending them a B2B email. This is further highlighting that you must treat the ePD and GDPR as separate steps \n\nFor individual subscribers, there’s also the ‘soft opt-in’ exemption for purchases (for money) of goods or services. The exemption is an exemption to the requirement to obtain consent provided you meet the process requirements. The ePD does not mention legitimate interest therefore it is not legitimate interest (it just looks a little bit like it). Again, you would do both an ePD assessment and a GDPR assessment, but because you’re not obtaining specific consent for ePD compliance, you might actually choose to rely on legitimate interests for the personal data processing elements instead. \n\nI’m not going to go into cookies much because this is longer than I expected already.\n\nCookies are similar in that there are two elements:\n\n- compliance with ePD if you’re dropping a cookie (or similar tracking technology e.g cookieless, fingerprinting, pixels, server-side tracking, beacons)\n- compliance with GDPR if that tracking also includes personal data processing\n\nEssential cookies are the ones that enable your site to function as intended. These do not require consent. If they require personal data of the visitor, you will need to do a separate GDPR assessment, and same as above when you don’t need consent for ePD compliance you might choose to use legitimate interest for the GDPR lawful basis. I’ve seen some spectacular justifications for trying to recategorise non-essential cookies as essential, in my time as a DPO. \n\nFor non-essential cookies you require consent from the user of the terminal device (device used to access the site/app/service). There is no delineation here between B2B and B2C.\n\nAgain, the two part test is-\n\n- Do I need consent for ePD compliance?\n- If my cookie uses personal data, what is my GDPR lawful basis?\n\nAgain, if you’re getting cookie consent for ePD it can be expedient to use consent as the GDPR lawful basis if your cookie banner also gives enough info about the personal data processing the cookie does. Again, a purist would disagree and would argue they should be separate consents, but at some point punishing users with benign checkboxes based on a purist interpretation of two laws is only going to make your customers and colleagues hate you. \n\nSimilar rules for delivering advertising by way of cookies, but this is typically broken into 3 categories:\n\nPersonalised advertising\n- consent to drop cookie for ePD compliance \n- lawful basis for GDPR compliance (usually consent combined with with the ePD because legitimate interests assessments usually fail for personalised adverts tracking)\n\nNon-personalised adverts\n- consent for cookies under ePD\n- choose your lawful basis for any personal data processing (for non-personalised, this is usually just IP address so you can typically choose consent or legitimate interest)\n\nFallback advertising (this is where if a user rejects advert cookies, a default advert will show which does not rely on cookies)\n- ePD compliance isn’t necessary for a fall back advert\n- advert still uses IP address, so GDPR compliance is required. Since you don’t need consent for ePD, you might choose to satisfy your GDRP aspects with legitimate interest.\n\n[updated to further clarify that ePD and GDPR are two separate compliance exercises that need to done. The only overlap is ePD does not define ‘consent’ so this is borrowed from the GDRP]",

Not sure what receipts you could possibly wish to see in that scenario. Generally, case law and receipts are not required here, the EDPB guidance on the technical scope of Article 5(3) of the ePD, Report on the work undertaken by the cookie taskforce (pay close attention to scenario H, as this discusses the delineation between the parallel obligations of ePD and GDPR), and the guidance on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR are more comprehensive than old case law. \n\nYou've misunderstood the delineation between ePD obligations and GDPR obligations which I clearly state are two separate requirements, one of the many points of the Planet49 decision rules on. The ePD does not care about personal data, and the GDPR does not care about tracking technologies which do not process personal data or about the consent requirement for individual subscribers to receive direct marketing by electronic means.\n\n>but you’re still overstating LI’s ability to bypass ePD despite the Planet49 ruling basically linking ePD and GDPR standards. *Only* the soft opt in exemption exists.\n\nUnequivocally, at no point do I state that legitimate interest is relevant to complying with ePD obligations. Also, the soft opt-in exemption only applies to electronic direct marketing. Not cookies, just in case anyone reads this and is unclear.\n\n>The ePrivacy Directive regulates a number of things, but most commonly relevant to GDPR practitioners and marketers are the rules on direct electronic marketing and cookies. The ePD is not concerned with the processing of personal data, it is only concerned with the requirements for certain activities.\n\nTo which you responded:\n\n>3. It does not matter whether the cookies constitute personal data or not - Article 5(3) of the e-Privacy Directive (i.e. the cookie consent rule) applies to any information installed or accessed from an individual's device.\n\nThis is just a less clear rehash of what I said. The ePD doesn't care about personal data, it cares about the requirements for certain activities, such as sending marketing or using cookies (or similar tracking technologies) in order to obtain information originating from the terminal device.\n\n>2. Where consent is required for cookies under the e-Privacy Directive, the GDPR standard of consent applies.\n\n\"\\_Where consent is required\\_\" is the key phrase here. Not all cookies require consent. If they require consent, then consent is measured against the GDPR standard (again, I discussed the interplay lex generalis and specialis in my above response). As I mentioned above in the cookie taskforce report, the first step is to assess whether you need consent for your activity under the ePD. The second step is to assess whether you also need a lawful basis under GDPR if your activity processes personal data. ePD mandates consent to perform the activity (not for the processing of personal data), but that does not mean that your GDPR lawful basis has to be the same for the processing of personal data. This interplay between ePD requirements and GDPR requirements can be read in the EDPB guidance on the processing personal data based on Article 6(1)(f).",

                "body": ">Legitimate interest is *very* strictly defined\n\nThis is where you lose me. Here's a sentence from the EDPB Guidelines 1/2024 document's executive summary: \n\n>A proper Article 6(1)(f) GDPR assessment is not a straightforward exercise.\n\nStraight out of the gate, the guidelines are telling us \"it's very complicated\". Which it is! Because that's how LI was written. And where there's complexity, there's ambiguity - and where there's ambiguity, there are loopholes. Or at least, arguments to be made for loopholes.\n\nAnd as far as the UK goes, I'd suggest things are far worse. Here's the [ICO's definition of LI](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/legitimate-interests/what-is-the-legitimate-interests-basis/): \n\n>Legitimate interests is different to the other lawful bases as it is not centred around a particular purpose (eg performing a contract with the individual, complying with a legal obligation, protecting vital interests or carrying out a public task), and it is not processing that the individual has specifically agreed to (consent). Legitimate interests is more flexible and could in principle apply to any type of processing for any reasonable purpose.\n\nAny type of processing.\n\nFor any reasonable purpose.\n\nAnd a bit further on in the same document: \n\n>The UK GDPR does not define what factors to take into account when deciding if your purpose is a legitimate interest. It could be as simple as it being legitimate to start up a new business activity, or to grow your business.\n\nAnd on and on and on it goes.\n\nThen here's the [ICO on how to apply LI in practice](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/legitimate-interests/how-do-we-apply-legitimate-interests-in-practice/):\n\n>An LIA is a type of light-touch risk assessment based on the specific context and circumstances of the processing.\n\nI defy you to tell me this is strictly defined. If you do, then - as you demand from others - I expect receipts.\n\nTo be clear, I hate this. I think LI is dramatically underdefined and overused. \n\nAnd while you say \"oh look, all these companies got fined\", in reality that list consists of seven companies. Most companies ARE getting away with misusing LI - because who has the time and budget to actually go through and slap down every instance of even largeish companies taking the mick.\n\nWhile things might be somewhat better in Europe, in the UK the [ICO's 2024 performance](https://www.urmconsulting.com/blog/analysis-of-fines-imposed-by-the-information-commissioners-office-in-2024) was, by my estimate, pretty dismal. It issued 15 private-sector fines last year, [every single one of them](https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/?entype=monetary-penalties&from=2024-01-01&to=2024-12-31) for unsolicited calls or messages.\n\nAnd re cookies, the ICO reprimanded - not fined - one company in 2024.\n\nOne!\n\nTo emphasise a point: I wish you were right. I wish more companies were taken to task for actions under LI. I wish there was much more definition of the term, and what does or does not fall under it.\n\nBut I do not believe this is the case.",

Use a tracking tool that captures IP Address. If the device is the Same, then the IP address most likely will be the same. GA4 does not do this. Motomo analytics does this and should by default identify the user as the same between both or at least you should be able to identify based on the IP address + Device data.  \n2. In GA you can try to create a similar fingerprint but without the IP address -> using the Device + location + time matching - this is going to be hard with GA4 web but very much possible with BigQuery (accuracy could be a little off!)\n\nDM me if you have any further questions on this.",

Furthermore, if these things are disabled, it shouldn't affect data collection much at all, I'd say.

We have two separate websites on different domains and want to track whether a user is a visitor/member to one via a cookie , so we can use that to influence their experience on the other site. Currently, I have GTM setting a cookie based on whether the user has visited certain pages but I'm tracking the effectiveness of this with a combination of events in GTM and Google Analytics and there looks like a 10% error. I'm fairly new to both GA and GTM so it could be either errors on GTMs side or GAs side. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with setting cookies in GTM and if you think this is a safe way to set the cookie?\n\nEDIT: The sites are on subdomains",

Safari's ITP deletes cookies after seven days, if someone comes back, they are reset, if they come afterwards, they still need to log in and while they are logged in they will have their users id cookie. (This is an example, doesn't mean on your site it's done exactly this way).\n\nIf this exists, then you have to implement stuff as said in my previous comment. If not, you would have to find out how sessions and cookies and users are handled in your site to be able to find what sets a registered user from a non-registered one apart.\n\nHope this kind of helps.",

There are tons of ways to do this, for example you could let developers implement datalayer events. As GTM doesn’t store data it is up to you to create tags, variables and triggers that read those dataLayers and send the data to GA4 for example. Next to datalayer event which a developer can implement you can also track various actions and parameters with CSS selectors for example. Cookies will contains a user and session id. So if a user visits your website a cookie is set. If he returns GA4 will read the cookie and thereby know that it is a returning user.\n\nIn a complete GTM course you will learn about all these aspects. Cookies, events, variables/parameters like the name of a button or the item that was viewed. It will learn you how to debug your setup with GTM and in the GTM debugger you will see literally every data that’s coming in and which you could use to enhance your tracking according to your needs. You’ll find a lot of automatically collected data for example which you could add to events as parameters as desired. \n\nI think learning GTM is the best way to get familiar with all aspects you’d like to learn. While you start working in GTM to set up tracking according to your compagnies goals you’ll, of course, run into a loads of questions and there is no single answer to solve them. Communication with developers about how to extract data from a website will get you more and more technical but ways of extracting data yourself with CSS selectors for example will teach you the technical sides of tracking to!\n\nThere’s extremely much to learn like server side tracking, SQL and bigQuery and much more. But knowing how data collections works is at the basis of all of this. Don’t expect, and don’t try to learn all aspects at once. Get comfortable with GTM and they you can proceed with other aspects that you’re interested in!",

You could use once per session for example, but some websites might have multiple forms with the same thank you page over and over again and if multiple are filled out by the same user you would indeed want it to fire multiple times.\n\nYour advice about keeping it simple is definitely good advice, just wanted to point out that there are still things to think about to be sure that the data is accurate. Some degree of knowledge of tag manager functionalities like settings from your example about triggering once per page / once per session / or on every specified event should be thought about while implementing more ‘general’ triggers.",

Once you’re working with GTM and you’re unsure how something works so you Google it, he’s the one that’s on top of your search results with the answer to any question that you can think of! While I didn’t do it myself, I think his is probably one of the best.\n\nSimo Ahava is like te biggest legend in GTM, but currently more into server side I think. In many blogs about GTM from others you’ll see him being mentioned as the one who created/found out solutions to problem. I found a course (https://cxl.com/institute/online-course/advanced-google-tag-manager/)on CXL (maybe your company has an account as well, which would make it free) from him but I suggest you to ask them how old it is, much has changed over time, so if it’s outdated you shouldn’t use it probably. Analytics mania is up to date for sure!\n\nIn these courses they are also going to talk about basic HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Basic knowledge of this will be helpful eventually. If you have reached those topics in your GTM course and want to learn the basics of these, then check out codecsdemy, I found their html, css and JavaScript courses straight to the point and they are free to!\n\nIn conclusion. Yes, analyticsmania is an excellent choice. Simo Ahava’s course on CXL should be to if it’s not outdated so might want to mail them!",

        "author": "Green_Database9919",
        "id": "1ik44tf",
        "selftext": "Look, I get it. Enhanced Conversions is one of those things that sounds simple but gets messy real quick. After helping countless clients fix their setups, I've seen pretty much every way this can go wrong (and right). This is what I've learned. \n\n**First up - What's the actual deal with Enhanced Conversions?**\n\nHere's the simple version: Enhanced Conversions is basically Google's backup plan for when normal tracking fails. It takes stuff you're already collecting (emails, phone numbers) and matches them with Google accounts to track conversions. Trust me, with third-party cookies dying, you're gonna want this.\n\n**\"Do I really need this if I'm already using...?\"**\n\nI get this question constantly, so let me clear it up once and for all:\n\n1. **Using offline conversion uploads?** Yes, you still want Enhanced Conversions. I've tested this extensively - they actually work together. Enhanced Conversions catches the online stuff, and your offline uploads catch the rest. More data = better decisions.\n2. **Running GA4?** Again, yes. Here's what I've learned the hard way: GA4 imports are fine, but native Google Ads tracking (especially with Enhanced Conversions) usually catches more. Pro tip from someone who's tested both: Set up Google Ads as primary, GA4 as secondary, and thank me later. In my experience, server-side tracking tends to be the most reliable source of truth - I've seen it catch conversions that client-side solutions miss entirely. \n\n1. **\"But my data collection is weird...\"** Collecting user data before the conversion page? I see this all the time, and it's totally fine. Here's what works:\n   1. Stash the data in hidden fields\n   2. Use local storage\n   3. Server-side storage if you're fancy (and honestly the easiest while being the most effective)\n   4. Just make sure that data's available when the conversion fires. I've seen people overthink this - it's simpler than you'd think.\n2. **Email stuff you need to know**. After fixing countless broken setups, here's the big one people miss:\n   1. Gmail addresses? Strip the dots and anything after '+' (learned this one the hard way)\n   2. Other email providers? Leave them alone\n   3. Paranoid about privacy? Hash before sending\n\n# Real talk about what happens after setup\n\n# \"Help! My numbers went crazy!\"\n\nDon't panic - I see this all the time:\n\n* Numbers went up? You're probably catching conversions you missed before \n* Numbers tanked? 90% of the time it's email normalization\n* All over the place? Give it a few weeks - I usually tell clients to wait at least 2-4 weeks before freaking out\n* I've seen server-side implementations consistently capture about 20% more conversions than client-side solutions. Not surprising given all the browser restrictions these days, but still worth noting.\n\n# \"Which numbers should I trust?\"\n\nHere's what I've found works best:\n\n1. Make Enhanced Conversions your primary\n2. Keep GA4/offline as backup\n3. Watch both for a month before making any big decisions\n\n# The privacy stuff you're worried about\n\nI've dealt with plenty of paranoid clients (rightfully so), so here's the deal:\n\n* Everything gets hashed\n* It's all first-party data you already have\n* Yes, it's privacy-law friendly\n* Super security conscious? Pre-hash it yourself\n\n# What I tell all my clients to do\n\n1. Keep your existing tracking running - seriously, don't turn it off\n2. Test with a small segment if you can\n3. Watch your conversion rates like a hawk for the first month\n4. Don't ditch your offline tracking\n\n# Quick setup checklist (because we all love checklists)\n\n✓ Say yes to Google's data terms (obvious but people forget)   \n✓ Pick your setup method (GTM, Google tag, API - they all work)   \n✓ Fix those email formats (especially Gmail)   \n✓ Test on a small scale first   \n✓ Give it 30 days before judging   \n✓ Compare with your other tracking\n\nLook, Enhanced Conversions isn't perfect, but it's become pretty essential with all the tracking changes happening. After setting this up hundreds of times, I can tell you it's worth doing - just do it right the first time. And if you really want to future-proof your setup, consider server-side tracking - I've consistently seen it outperform client-side solutions by 10-20% in real-world testing.\n\nGot questions? Drop them in the comments. I've probably seen and fixed whatever issue you're running into.",

CookieYes should fire **before** any other tags.\n\nThis won’t reduce your sessions; in fact, it boosts GDPR compliance by making sure consent is handled before tracking kicks in.\n\nIf you still need help, you can write to [CookieYes GCM Support](https://www.cookieyes.com/gcm-support-center/).

        "selftext": "Is there another/better way to capture and send the fbclid URL parameter (which becomes the \\_fbc cookie/parameter) server-side?  Our current method:\n\n\n\nWhen we do tracking setups via GTM/sGTM, for Meta, one of the key components is the fblcid URL parameter for user matching and ad attribution.\n\nIf we're doing a web+server setup (Pixel + CAPI), the Meta Pixel will automatically read and capture the fbclid URL parameter and set it as the \"\\_fbc\" 1st party cookie, and pass it back with the Pixel data automatically.\n\nTo pass that \"fbc\" value server-side, in the web container, we create a 1st party cookie variable for \"\\_fbc\" (and \\_fbp also), and add it as an event object in the GA4 event tag.  (per Meta's documentation here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/guides/gtm-server-side/). Then in the sGTM container, we create an Event Data variable for that parameter, and then set it as the value for the Click ID parameter in the server tag.\n\nIf we're doing a setup that's server-side only (i.e. the Pixel doesn't automatically read the fbclid URL parameter and set the \\_fbc cookie), we use a Cookie Creator tag in GTM to set a 1st party cookie with format fb.1.{{Event Time}}.{{fbclid}}, where fblclid is the URL query variable.\n\n  \nHowever - we recently did a web+server setup on a Shopify store using their Customer Events section, and when we looked at the server container event data coming from the web container, it was saying that the fbc and fbp variables incoming were undefined.  I understand that the fbc parameter is only present if the user came from a paid ad, and thus has the fbclid URL parameter present.  But the \"fbp\" parameter is a device/browser identifier that should pretty much always be available.  \n  \nJust wondering if anyone has a different/better way of capturing and sending the fbc parameter server-side.",

They said if you use GTM that you need to send the custom parameter new\\_client \"yes\" \"no\". Fine but how technically we can do that? \n\nYes the easiest solution might be to ask to the user to login or not before he made the purchase. This method can be very frustrating for the user. \n\n  \nSo do you have a nice solution to check at the purchase conversion if it's a new or returning client? I don't want to use cookie because it's not resilient. My tought should be to check in the database when the purchase was made if the client email is already known? but there is a need for a fairly high execution speed here\n\nThanks a lot :) ",

Since ad blockers and cookie settings aren’t the issue, here are a few things to check:  \nTag Firing Timing – If the event fires too close to a page unload, GA4 might miss it. Try delaying the event slightly.  \nEvent Deduplication – Make sure duplicate events aren’t being filtered out by GA4’s deduplication logic.  \nBatch Processing – GA4 sometimes processes events in batches, so some may appear with a delay.  \n  \nIf you want a more reliable way to track purchases without worrying about these issues, Qwestify is a great alternative! It ensures accurate tracking and eliminates GA4’s event loss headaches. ",

        "selftext": "Hi everybody!\n\nI'm a GTM noob trying to learn more. I've done my googling, asked ChatGPT, the whole nine yards, but I'm still not 100% sure if GTM can cover my use case. Hoping one of y'all can help.\n\nI was wondering if GTM, in tandem with a first party cookie setup, could be used as a simple affiliate tracker. I run a niche political merchandise store and my product sells so-so online, but sells extremely well in person. So I partnered with a some local sellers who sell the merch in person through an affiliate link I generated via a domain link on bitly. Some of these sellers post the link as a QR code on their stalls or on their business cards and others post the link on their social media accounts. There are probably other ways they sell, but this accounts for the bulk of the traffic.\n\nI ran a couple tests with GA4 and see the rough makings of this being possible via the traffic and sale attribution features of GA4, but I noticed the accuracy was a bit off. That led me down a rabbit hole where I started learning about why data attribution can be spotty and how to fill the gaps using GTM, server side tracking, and first party cookies.\n\nI have a little bit of coding knowledge so I know I can pass conversion information directly from my website to a simple application I made that tracks clicks and conversions by affiliate link. \n\nBut this almost feels too simple? Will this setup give me high/near-perfect sale attribution accuracy (anything 90% or above would suffice) or am I missing something?\n\nFor those curious, I know there are affiliate apps out there already, but I don't need all of their features (and therefore cost) and honestly am kinda on a warpath to learn how this works anyway lol.\n\nSorry if this isn't a super clear question, I honestly am kinda grabbing around in the dark haha. Hope someone can help!\n\nThanks,   \nWalrus",

No information is being shown, which makes it pretty impossible for us to set up conversion tracking.\n\n  \nDoes anyone recognize this issue? I have no idea how to fix this.

When a link is generated in this system, it includes the following parameter: `netsag={agentname}`.\n\nI’m trying to set it up so I can create a report in Looker Studio showing the following for each individual agent:\n\n* Users\n* Sessions\n* Revenue\n* Transactions\n* Conversion rate\n\nThe URL parameter does not transfer to the checkout page, but I can see that the agent’s name is available on the checkout page under the cookie `lastAddedUrl`.\n\nI’ve created a tag that triggers upon purchase completion. It’s set up as below. I’ve also created ‘Value’ as a custom dimension in GA4. And when I check under events in the report, I do see `netsagskøb` appearing as an event, but there’s no total revenue displayed in the overview. When I click into the event, I can see the different agents who have generated sales, but I can’t see how much revenue they should be attributed.\n\nThe agents are displayed in a chart called ‘Agent’ separately, where the number of events and total users are shown. I also see a chart called ‘Value,’ and here I can see the purchase amounts, but they are listed without any additional information – as follows:\n\n|Custom parameter|Number of events|Total users|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Null|1.3k|568|\n|(not set)|381|234|\n|Undefined|77|77|\n|348|13|11|\n\nHow do I get the revenue to appear in the overview under events? And most importantly: how do I distribute the revenue among the different agents?\n\nI hope this makes sense and that someone can help me move forward 🙏\n\nThe tag is set up as follows:\n\nEvent name: `netsagskøb`\n\nEvent parameter: netsag | Event value: `{{Extract Netsag from lastAddedUrl}}`\\*\n\nEvent parameter: value | Event value: `{{eventModel.value}}`\n\nEvent parameter: `{{Extract Netsag from lastAddedUrl}}` | Event value: `{{eventModel.value}}`\n\nCheck in ‘Send e-commerce data’ – data source: Data layer\n\nTag trigger: Once per page\n\n**\\*{{Extract Netsag from lastAddedUrl}} Variable:**\n\nCustom JavaScript:\n\n    function() {\n        var cookies = document.cookie.split('; ');\n        for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) {\n            var parts = cookies[i].split('=');\n            if (parts[0] === 'lastAddedUrl') {\n                var url = decodeURIComponent(parts[1]);\n                var match = url.match(/netsag=([^&]*)/);\n                return match ? match[1] : undefined;\n            }\n        }\n        return undefined;\n    }",

I already have the TikTok Pixel and Conversion API set up on my website along with a server-side GTM container. My goal is to capture a unique identifier (like a client ID) for users who see my ads—even if they don’t click through initially. For example, if a user sees an ad on July 7, doesn’t click, but later on July 20 clicks through and makes a purchase, I’d love to correlate these events using a consistent identifier.\n\nHere’s what I’m considering/aware of:\n\n* **Click-Through Tracking:** I can capture parameters like `ttclid` on ad clicks and persist that via a first-party cookie on my website. This works well for users who click, and then I can tie subsequent events (pageviews, conversions, etc.) to that ID.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. **Is it possible** to capture and correlate a client ID for users who just see my ads (without clicking) using any method (e.g., a custom tracking pixel in the ad creative) while staying compliant with Platforms policies and privacy regulations?\n2. If yes, **what’s the best practice** for implementing this ?\n3. If it isn’t feasible to capture identifiers for impression-only users, are there any alternative strategies or workarounds that can help approximate the full user journey from ad view to conversion?\n\nAny insights, experiences, or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!",

Check via preview mode if you can identify your form submission with the history change or form events that are pushed to the dataLayer as mentioned before.\n\nAn other option could be using CSS selectors.

By all means, a direct integration with each individual API is great but everytime you need to make a change or add something new you need to involve a developer.\n\n\nUsing a centralized solution means that the developer can manage the quality of a single API (the one to your tagging server) instead of however many for each individual vendor you want to integrate.\n\n\nAdditionally, a dedicated tagging server allows you to do stuff other than exclusively forward requests to vendors. You can set cookies and serve scripts in a first party context, modify requests, enrich data, etc.",

Conflict with website CSP (Content security Policy)\n5. also, apparently, the Google Ads tags can sometimes simply \"look that way\" despite them working correctly.

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI’m experiencing an issue where my BI dashboard consistently reports around 40% more conversions than my advertising platform. I’m using Google Tag Manager (GTM) to implement postback tracking for the advertising platforms. \nI suspect there may be a problem with how I store and retrieve the clickid parameter, but I’m not sure where the gap could be coming from.\n\nHere’s how my tracking is set up:\n1. Landing Page (LP): Capturing and Storing clickid. When a user lands on the LP, I capture the clickid parameter from the URL and store it in localStorage when they click the CTA button:\n\n<script>\n  // Define the variable to store\n  var stored_gclid = {{gclid}}; // GTM variable capturing the clickid\n\n  // Store it in localStorage\n  localStorage.setItem('stored_gclid', stored_gclid);\n</script>\n\n\n2. Thank You Page (TYP): Retrieving the clickid\nOn the TYP, I pull the stored clickid from localStorage using this custom JavaScript function in GTM:\n\nfunction() {\n  return localStorage.getItem('stored_gclid');\n}\n\n\n3. Firing the Postback\nThe postback is triggered using the clickid retrieved from localStorage:\n\nhttps://example.com/pixel?info=601023&unique_req={{Pulled CID}}\n\n\n\n* No significant browser/device differences: All users are on Windows, and Firefox is the browser.\n\nMy Questions:\n\n1. Could there be an issue with localStorage causing this gap?\n2. Is there a better way to store and retrieve the clickid to reduce these discrepancies? For example, should I switch to cookies parameters for better reliability?\n3. What else could explain the 40% gap?\n\nAny insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Let me know if you need more details about the implementation.",

After we have set up everything they confirmed that everything is working, but once again we got an email saying that something is failing with enhanced conversions. It has been a process to get everything set up for GCMv2, especially as the site is driven by Joomla. \n\nBut that is not the biggest problem. We experienced unusual drop in page visits in Analytics (flagged also as anomaly by GA), and some users were complaining that they were trying to do a reservation and when they were trying to send us the reservation (click on a button), all the data from their form would disappear and they couldn't finish the process. \n\nAfter trying a few things, I found out that if the user does not accept cookies, a weird code gets generated and it is added after the original URL when they click on a link eg:\\_gl=5\\*122rme\\*\\_up\\*SQ..\\*\\_ga\\*BTc4STUzSzQyOC4xNzFxQUQ0OTgz\\*\\_ga\\_84KRT983QW\\*MTczMTk0PRDKi4xLjAuMTczMTk0NDkL3TSwLjAuMA (changed the codes with some random letters as I don't know if these codes can be used for something as there are our GA tags for example but the structure is there) and it throws 403. \n\nAt the moment I have disabled GTM and everything works fine again, but I am trying to understand what is happening and why this gets generated. Anybody has some experience with this?",

Everything seems to work fine in Google Chrome, but when I try to load my website in Safari, I can see a bunch of \"Failed to load resource...\" and \"Cannot load \\*insert javascript file name.\\*...\\* errors in the console. \n\n  \nI am currently testing on Safari 17.3  (MacOS Monterey) and have also tested on ios 17.4.1. Based on my own research, it sounds like GTM isn't necessarily blocked but any scripts loaded through GTM are? I have checked my privacy settings and have unchecked \"Prevent cross-site tracking\", \"Use advanced tracking and fingerprinting protection\" and \"Block all cookies\". Not seeing any other relative settings. I am assuming my scripts failing to load (which are all through GTM) are failing because of Safaris blocking features. Are there any reliable work arounds for this?\n\n  \nI will say, I am also experiencing another strange phenomenon. If I clear my cache and cookies in Safari. Then go to my website. I dont see any errors in the console and all of my scripts seem to load just fine. However, once I refresh the page, that is when I start seeing all of the \"failed to load errors\" and is when things start to get blocked. What's up with that? Is this common behavior with Safari?

Server-side GTM (using Stape in our case) with GA4 handling the Google Ads conversions, and the conversion data provided in the data layer when the user reaches the order confirmation page. The main issue I'm concerned about there is ad blockers, some of which can even apparently block this setup. And apparently some of them fiddle with the actual GA4 events/data layer updates to do the blocking.\n2. Offline conversion tracking. We can grab the GCLID when the user arrives at our site, store it in a server-side cookie, and retrieve it when the user reaches the order confirmation page. Then we can submit it to Google Ads as an offline conversion. The potential issue there is that it doesn't capture conversions that occur over multiple devices (some of which can be caught in approach #1 above with enhanced conversions).\n\nWe can implement either of these on a technical level, it's just a question of which approach is going to give us more robust conversion data?",

Meta will “prefer” (in their own words) the event that is received first, which in almost all cases will be your client-side event. I have done some testing to verify this and can confirm that if Meta receives an event from the browser and then receives the same event from the server-side Conversion API, the server-side event will be discarded because the client-side event was received first. From my testing, this will be the case event though you are sending extra identifiers with the server-side event.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a disappointing way of handling deduplication, but we have to work with what we got. If you’re looking to pass extra identifiers with the server-side event, then you’re probably better off only having server-side tracking, as having a client-side pixel will result in the server-side events being discarded most of the time. Keep in mind that you can still pass cookies and query parameters/UTM with the server-side events.\n\nI hope this clears things up.",

Assuming this might be an interface issue or just unclear wording on the tooltip, we tested a hybrid setup using both the Conversion API and the client-side pixel, comparing it against a setup using only the Conversion API. When comparing Event Match Quality Scores, the setup running solely on the Conversion API received the extra identifiers much more consistently than the hybrid setup.\n\nIt’s possible that this behaviour has changed since our tests about a year ago, or that our case may have been an outlier.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the differences and potential issues:  \n**Limitations:**\n\n* **Initial Client-Side Dependency**: The initial GA4 events are still dependent on JavaScript running in the user's browser, which means they are susceptible to ad blockers, JavaScript errors, and other client-side issues.\n* **Latency**: Potential latency is introduced as data moves from the client to GA4, then to server-side GTM, and finally to the Meta Conversions API.\n* **Accuracy**: Data might still be less accurate due to browser-based data collection limitations (e.g., cookie restrictions, data obfuscation).",

Can you see the response below from the other commenter and let me know your thoughts here - my thinking is that, since CAPI is still dependent on client-side GTM, it isn't actually improving the number of events captured overall since the browser event has to work correctly first? But maybe it just helps with campaign attribution based on the cookie functionality you mentioned.",

A lot of the extra data capture comes from users who have ad blockers, etc. that block requests to known 'tracking' domains (Google, Facebook, etc.) but since the requests to the server container should be going to a subdomain of the website (e.g. sgtm.site.com) & not to Google/Facebook the requesters aren't blocked & the net result is incremental data capture.  Feel free to ask other questions, but this is something that I'm quite certain of from experience implementing CAPI this way on nearly 100 websites (including at my current job, where we have 350-500k sessions a day & have observed an aggregate 8% lift in Facebook events due to CAPI over the last year since I implemented it).  To your points about attribution, it definitely helps since the cookies set by the server are more durable.",

I resolved it by setting up a 'Google Tag' in GTM with our Google Ads ID, and then the error ceased. But from what I've read and understood, setting up the 'Google Ads Conversion Tracker' and 'Conversion Linker' should have been sufficient. I'm affriad that now with the recent \"Google Tag\", it might cause some problems, for example i'm seeing a few double conversions registration in Gads now, that later are being corrected.",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \nI've been testing for the last couple of days the GTM server side and G ads conversions, and i need some help figuring out if this is the correct approach.\n\nMy testing environment is a simple Node.js express app on localhost and I'm not using any of the GTM JS stuff on the site, I'm sending a post request with the custom event name.  \n\n\nSteps so far:  \nCreated a GTM Server side container using Google Cloud Platform just to test it out.  \nAdded a client to catch the activation path for the request  \nAdded 2 tags: Conversion Linker on all pages and google ads conversion tracking with ID and Label com G.Ads with the correct trigger.  \nAdded a trigger for a custom event name.  \n\n\nSo far so good and using the preview it works and fires the tag when i make the request from Node.  \nNow my doubts are:  how can i confirm on G.Ads if this is working as supposed? On the conversions i don't see any data.  \nDo i need cookies from the browser too, so G.ads makes a match to a user ?  \nDo i need to use GA4 for this? Or even add the JS part to the site? (makes no sense to me if its supposed to improve page speed)\n\nAm I missing somethings here?  \n\n\nThanks in advance :)",

Analytics is regularly trying to attribute credit across all the different channels that people use to arrive at your site, and this extends to the conversion tracking as well. If you look at your conversion data, and add a secondary dimension showing the \"source/medium\" that can tell you the referral source for whatever conversion you're looking at.\n\nThe key here of course is ensuring that you have conversion tracking in Analytics set up correctly, and that there aren't any other factors that could be affecting your attribution data.\n\nThere are some smaller nuances here that can affect attribution in these platforms of course but this is the general reason why you're seeing what you're seeing.",

As long as the cookies are no longer there on the next page load, you're generally OK. Small complication exists for e.g. Facebook, which loves to install its own event handlers which might remain active unless the page is force reloaded when a user changes their consent from \"granted\" to \"denied\".\n\nYour options are that you could implement Google Consent Mode, or you implement exception triggers to block e.g. Google Analytics tags from firing unless consent is present. Last time I looked, OneTrust have very good documentation on how to do this. Essentially, you're regexing for \"C0004\" or similar as your fire / don't fire condition.\n\nEDIT\n\nI've just gone back to OneTrust's documentation. Looks like they are encouraging you to create a trigger for your tags that fires when e.g. C0003, C0004 etc *is present* (in the OneTrustActiveGroups variable).\n\nI'm not a fan of this. I would much rather create a new trigger that fires when C0003 etc. *aren't* present and use that as an exception trigger.\n\nThe benefit of this is it's much easier to read and maintain your firing triggers and you can create a small number of exception triggers and use those to bulk update your tags.",

Attributing costs of our ad campaigns is basically the most business critical thing. Currently we rely on a custom GTM container running on our own domain (via stape.io) with postbacks for conversion tracking to Meta/Google/Tiktok/Bing. We then connect Bigquery through the GA4 integration and mix in ad costs via funnel.io. Our marketing team relies mostly on data tracked by hyros, which is a great service for attribution.  \nOn the product analytics side (app), we are switching to Segment/Mixpanel from pure GA4 for obvious reasons. I am now considering to replace GTM/GA4/Bigquery/funnel.io with Segment/Mixpanel as well. It looks like Segment offers pretty much all of the features that I need, including same domain proxy (Analytics.js can be proxied through our domain). In addition, Segment also offers server side events, where I could postback conversions to ad networks with a much higher accuracy compared to client side tracking (there will always be 3rd party cookie blockers and ad blockers).  \nOther than the cost of Segment/Mixpanel, I don't really see any big red flags, but maybe I'm missing something?

The odds of getting one might be low, but some large businesses and some small business have been fined, and the fines are big.

This kind of thing already happens with certain copyright images, certain accessibility issues, etc.  So IMO it is worth the effort of shielding yourself by following the law.\n\n\n  \n\nIf you actually do it right, any relevant cookies should not have \"already loaded\".  You wait until they accept, and then if they do you run whatever tracking or analytics they opted into.  If you are tracking before they accept then you are obviously in violation of GDPR.\n\nYou can set *some* cookies without them accepting.  For example, a cookie that stores the status of if they accepted or denied the opt-in.  Or a session cookie that stores your auth token so you can log in or access whatever relevant data is behind your login.\n\n\n\nTracking cookies like you mention in your comments (GA, posthog, etc) are NOT necessary cookies and will put you in violation.  And no, you can't just declare them necessary, you will 100% lose big in court if you take that argument.  Your site needs to wait for someone to opt-in BEFORE you create those cookies or run those scripts, or you're in direct violation of the law.  Yes, some people will not opt in and you will have less data. It's not the end of the world to not track every single user; you will get enough data from a representative sample that captures the trends.  \n\nThe banners are usually designed to pop up in a bit of an annoying way so people just quickly hit the accept button and you get some tracking data.\n\n\n\nSome sites do it wrong or not at all, and they are exposing themselves to some level of risk.

Some websites still work fine while some others get broken totally regarding to their functionality so you can't use them. Another example is that embedded X or YouTube content won't work without the consent.",

                "body": "When it comes to GDPR and similar privacy laws, clicking “Deny” is not just for show, it should have a real workflow behind it. If a user clicks “Deny,” your website must genuinely block non-essential cookies and tracking scripts (like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Posthog, or any third-party trackers) from being activated without explicit consent.\n\nIn practice, this means: \n\n1.  The consent process must be clear and detailed. Users should be able to opt in or out of specific cookie categories. A “Deny” click should immediately prevent those tracking functions from being executed.  \n2. It’s not enough to simply show a cookie banner with a “Deny” button. You need to ensure, technically, that non-essential cookies or trackers aren’t loaded as soon as the page fires up.  \n3. Storing the user’s decision (for instance, via a dedicated cookie) to remember that they said “no” is acceptable. but only if it truly stops any unwanted tracking. \n4. Most importantly, it’s about respecting your users. If someone tells your site “No thanks,” you honor that choice immediately. Otherwise, it’s not only poor practice, but it might also land you in trouble with regulators.\n\nJust think of it this way: the “Deny” button isn’t just there to make your legal department feel warm and fuzzy. it has to work as advertised. Otherwise, your site might end up being the digital equivalent of a restaurant that pretends to offer gluten-free options but secretly serves bread with gluten anyway. Not cool, and definitely not compliant. Germany is about to pass a law requiring a reject / deny button [link](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Administrative-court-Cookie-banner-must-contain-Reject-all-button-10390520.html). \n\nTL;DR: When a user clicks “Deny,” make sure your site genuinely stops non-essential cookies and tracking from running, because fancy banners without proper controls won’t keep the regulators off your back (or your users happy). \n\nFYI, I’m the creator of [c15t.com](http://c15t.com),",

Honestly I think it doesn't go nearly far enough and that we should have baked privacy concerns into the actual architecture of the web from the get go. But hindsight is 20/20 and security is very hard to do well as a result.\n\nThere are two reasons to think a company might be in compliance with GDPR:\n\n - They are the kind of company that is probably subject to pretty intense external security audits. Like financial institutions, gaming companies - basically anyone where if they lose their data or their IP then their entire business fails. \n\n - They are the kind of company that is either large enough to be a natural target for people enforcing the law at a national level, or they are a company with a lot of EU clients who match the description of the first type of company. \n\nExample: I was in charge of GDPR compliance when it first went into effect. I was told to punt completion on the work in favor of some bullshit marketing thing against my objections. We got a phone call from our largest EU client the next morning (Bosch) who ripped our security team a new asshole for not being in compliance. This did not in any way advance any part of my career.

Legal doesn't even want us saving user ui config settings (think: dark mode) in the US for EU users. There are a lot of cases where we build features, for US market only because of this. \n\nMany times we feel legal is overreacting, but to be fair on their part, being non-compliant could mean millions of dollars, so the play is always to be more cautious than not, even if it  impacts new features, and quality of life.

We design a website trying to make is as appealing and user friendly as possible and then we put that garbage on top we might as well draw doodly genitals on the Mona Lisa and force people to stare at it 5 times a day if they _don't_ want their data stolen.\n\nI don't know who makes up internet rules but whoever thought that 'just' having these popovers all over the place m and not declaring further explicite  requirements to maintain a positive experience would be a fine solution mustve been freaking high.\n\nEdit: I was just kind of venting, not expecting this to blew up lol. Still glad to see you people share this opinion. To those who state installing a work around, such as a plug in - you didn't really get my point. Yes, it may fix it for some or even most websites, but _having to_ install such workarounds can _also_ be considered a negative user experience. Same goes for \"immediately leaving the website\" - why have to open it to just close it to begin with. The problem is less about a \"specific\" website not being user friendly, but rather the general standards on the web.\nAnyway, tons of comments showing that it's not just about cookies but also registrations, newsletters, ads, etc. Even Google in incognito mode asks for cookies... Like... You want to read all that stuff about me but cannot realize that I'm incognito so there is no data for you to begin with... Why ask?",

Because as far as I know your users need to opt-in to *any* service that for example discloses their IP to a third party and provide a link to the privacy conditions of that third party so your users could at least potentially check out  what that third party would do with your IP (Do they store it? Do they sell the information that your IP just visited [hotkinkygrannies.com](https://hotkinkygrannies.com)?). \n\nAt the same time your users need to be able to opt-in and out of specific services: So they need to be able to accept getting their IP logged by youtube.com but not by [weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannyporn.com](https://weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannies.com) \n\nIf consenting was a browser setting, then your browser would need to create a list of all services you come across and save your preference for that particular service – so effectively you'd only be asked *once* when you first encounter that service. Now the huge-ass list resulting from that wouldn't be such a big problem. But what could be a problem is this: Since most users only need to deny your third party service once and for all it will practically be burnt and useless soon. So I as a (hypothetical) third party service would then probably just move my service to a new domain so it registers as a new service with my browser every month or so (because we only can identify a service by the domain it's called from, can't we?). So maybe my code snippet that devs use to integrate my service would do something like getting the current MM-YY-date and call my service from my already setup domain [weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannyporn-06-22.com](https://weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannyporn.com) in June of 2022 and call the service again from [weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannyporn-07-22.com](https://weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannyporn-06-22.com) in the month after that and so on.\n\nDepending on my ROI I might even be able to secure a domain per day and then users would have to deny my service once every day. Of course this isn't as bad as having to deny or accept services on a per-website-basis but I guess people who are smarter than me could figure out a way, to make this appear on every website we visit, bringing us back to square one.",

And you can **only** store the cookies, AFTER it was accepted.\n\n/edit: These days the cookie-notice is just part of the gpdr-modal, if a gpdr modal is needed because of other data privacy related functions of your website.\n\ngpdr:\n\nWhenever you collect, aggregate or store \"private data\", or your Website use external services (via javascript or even include an image from an external service) you need the approve of the user. because the ip address is considered \"private data\" this is almost anytime needed. \n\nSome of the \"private data\" of the user can be flagged by yourself as \"needed\" or \"required\". This can be opt-in without the option to opt-out. Like a session-cookie or the ip-adress in serverlogs. When only those two options are the case, you don't need to \"shove it in the users face\" with a big modal. But a dark-pattern hidden icon or simple link to that information is not enough. More like a prominent Icon which opens the modal is enough. To be safe you can still require the modal to be accepted.\n\n----------\n\nLets assume:\n\n* You don't store ip adresses in logs or any type of watchdog or database-entry. There is no court ruling for pseudo-anonymised ip-adresses (like XXX.YYY.0.0 for the last two octetes), so its not legally safe. But somehow it is safe. Its a grey area.\n* You don't set cookies or anything else in the users browser.\n* You don't include any asset from another website. E.g. YT, fonts, javascripts from a CDN.\n* You don't have a contact form which sends emails to you.\n\nthen you don't need a cookie-banner or a gpdr banner. You just need to state in your \"data privacy\"-page that you don't do this.\n\n-----------\n\nBut, lets look at the lowest level most websites will have:\n\n* You have an serverlog with ip-adresses. If you don't know, ask your provider.\n* You set a cookie without any personal-data. Let's say a php-session-id. Even if you don't do anything with it.\n\nThen you need a gpdr-approve screen with one option:\n\n* \"Needed/Required\".  This can be default opt-in with no way to opt-out. And a text that states, that you set a cookie and store user-data (like ip-adress)\n\nAdditionally you must state in your \"data privacy\"-page that you store in your webserver-logs things like ip-adress with date, url, status-code. And how long you store this data and whom to contact to get it deleted. Also you must state that you set a cookie.\n\nIf you have no cookie, but the serverlogs you still need that section.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's mostly it. There is only ONE way for a Website to avoid that popup. And its not storing or aggregate ip-adresses anywhere and don't change any possible persistent data on the client (cookies, sql in browser).",

Like no IP address is stored and I have no way to tie back the session to the user, it’s just a random UUID, no PII.\n\nhmmm. Even if you have internal a UUID, you will most-likely have a session-cookie. So you \"manipulate\" data on the computer . So you need the cookie-law-banner. Or you have a UUID+ip-adress without session-cookie, but then you aggregate or compute \"private data\" and need the gpdr modal.\n\n> Can you track analytics that way for things like button clicks without a banner?\n\nThis is a really grey area. The law is so loosy written that \"private-data\" can be \"aggregated\" or \"computed\" without the need to opt-in or possibility to opt-out.\n\nYou can not (without consent) send the data to google analytics or similar services. Any data going to third-party must be approved. Even if you include an image from anywhere. then the users ip-adress will be logged on the server where you include the image from.\n\nBut you can declare \"server-logs with ip-adresses\" as \"needed/required\" to monitor your service. THEN you can declare, that you monitor your services with an self-hosted matomo (Not the cloud-version). Or any other self-hosted plattform. And because not needed you will anonymize the ip-adress in matomo and disable the matomo-session-cookie. (Rule to minimize all unneeded data as mandatory by gpdr).\n\nIn this set:\n\n* ip-adress in log\n* an self-hosted analyze-tool without cookies and anonimzed private-data (ip-adress)\n\nYou can have the \"not shoved in your face\" gpdr-modal.\n\nI know some organizations, that just import the webserver logs in their self-hosted matomo. No javascript tracking. So they know the clicked sites and some sort of user-tour, but its not THAT reliable. They need to state in the \"privacy\"-page that they aggregate that data, but that is all. No gpdr modal.\n\nSome organizations do it with javascript tracking on self-hosted matomo too without gpdr consent. But.... Maybe its not okay. Without a court-ruling in this case nobody knows if its okay.",

They make just as many client-side tags as a standard client-side tracking solution and instead point the data at their first-party endpoint.\n\ne.g. a whole bunch of GA4 Event tags that send data about individually tracked events to [metrics.example.com](http://metrics.example.com) instead of letting GA4 send data where it wants (region1.google-analytics.com and suchlike).",

It can be spoofed, and isn't reliable.\n\nStill, you can check for it & send a cookie for the user if it happens to match a certain value.... The user's device will send that cookie back until it gets cleared (or expires)\n\nSo this is where things get tricky -- a user might open a new tab, that should be fine. If they close that tab, do nothing... But if they close the LAST tab tied to the referrer, you want to clear the \"referrer cookie\" ... If the user comes back to the site from a different place, all by themselves or via bookmarks let's say, you don't want the referrer cookie present.\n\nSo, this is super-fucky and doesn't really jive with how users use web sites. If someone first hears about the site from zyz, but they close the window & reopen, zyz is still responsible for the traffic, in practice. You might be able to use page visibility events -- take a read through here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/page-lifecycle-api .... Basically if a tab becomes \"hidden\" you fire a request to backend to clearCookie. If it becomes \"active\" you need some way to re-add the cookie if it's not already present. The other tricky bit is if someone opens a new tab, original tab is \"hidden\" so cookie is blasted, but the new tab should identify, somehow, that it came from zyz, ad re-add it.... That's not really possible though because referrer only goes 1x back, so it'll be yourself in the new tab. I don't know. This is off the top of my head, there's a lot of weird edge cases to track, and this whole scheme flies in the face of how attribution & referral codes usually work. For reference:\n\n* Provide special query string parameter that has referral code\n\n* Do we have referral code qs? If no cookie, assign it.... If there is already a cookie, either replace or so nothing.\n\n* Does user \"convert\"? Remove the cookie if present.\n\nTypically the expiry varies... I've seen a week used, sometimes upwards of a month.\n\nIf user switches device and loses referral code, tough shit.",

Consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. In order to obtain freely given consent, it must be given on a voluntary basis. The element “free” implies a real choice by the data subject. Any element of inappropriate pressure or influence which could affect the outcome of that choice renders the consent invalid. \n\n> When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.\n\n> Consent is presumed not to be freely given […] if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance.",

But the bigger you are, the larger the risk of a thorough audit by a data protection agency. \n\nThe IP address issue is based on famous rulings where agencies and courts in Austria, Germany, France, and other EU countries found Google Analytics to be non-GDPR compliant because GA stored and transferred to overseas personally identifiable information, such as non-anonymized IP addresses. (Google Analytics has [solved this problem](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12017362?hl=en) on their part ever since.):\n\n> Austrian regulator ruled that in providing the Google Analytics service, the company collects and transfers personal data to the U.S. while failing to protect it from U.S. government surveillance. The DPA determined configuration abilities for customers, including truncating IP addresses, are insufficient to prevent re-identification, potentially by Google or the U.S. government. The decision also determined that supplementary measures implemented by Google, including government access transparency reports and encryption of data, were insufficient.\n\nhttps://dataprotectionprivacy.eu/en/google-analytics-found-to-be-non-compliant-with-the-gdpr/\n\nhttps://wideangle.co/blog/is-google-analytics-illegal-under-gdpr\n\nSome companies [even got fined](https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/swedish-watchdog-fines-tele2-for-gdpr-breaches/) for using the older version of GA which didn't have the EU specific measures:\n\n> The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) fined Tele2 SEK12 million ($1.1 million) for breaching GDPR rules, following an audit of how the operator used Google Analytics services. [...] The audit concerned a version of Google Analytics from 2020, when the initial complaint was filed. [...] The authority noted Tele2 recently stopped using Google Analytics, through which it transmitted personal data including IP addresses and cookies from web browsers to the US.\n\nWhat the auditors were looking at is when a US-based service or website sends their visitor's data to servers located in the US. In these situations that data is no longer protected from the US intelligence agencies:\n\n> The Schrems II ruling established that the personal data of EU residents cannot be transferred to foreign countries unless those countries have data privacy laws considered equivalent to the protections offered by the GDPR.\n\n> Google Analytics collects a number of granular data points that are specific to individuals; for example, what search terms they might have used to reach the webpage or what series of pages they clicked on while visiting. However, the Google Analytics panel is not supposed to tell the site administrator anything that identifies those users (beyond an extremely general location). Thus, use of it was widely considered to not be a risk for a GDPR violation.\n\n> However, the Austrian DPA found that the IP addresses and identifiers in cookie data were sufficiently personal to constitute a GDPR violation. The IP addresses can be anonymized, but this must be proactively requested by the Google Analytics user. The Austrian DPA said that the website it was examining, a health site based in Austria called netdoktor.at, had apparently attempted to enable anonymization but did not configure it correctly.\n\nhttps://www.cpomagazine.com/data-protection/austrian-dpa-finds-use-of-google-analytics-outside-of-eu-constitutes-a-gdpr-violation/\n\n> The Austrian DPA found that Google Analytics cookies used by an Austrian website allowed the collection and transfer of personal data to Google in the U.S., including user ID numbers, IP addresses, and browser settings. Moreover, the Austrian DPA found that the SCCs executed by the website operator and Google did not provide an adequate level of protection under the GDPR, as Google's proffered supplemental safeguards did not overcome the risk of U.S. surveillance activities identified in the CJEU's Schrems II ruling.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/data-collection-eu-troubled-waters-us-companies-2022-02-25/\n\nNow, based on all this, IP addresses are indubitably considered personal data so you at the very least need consent to store them, and you cannot transfer them to servers outside the EU where they are more vulnerable.",

        "selftext": "For years I have been doing embedded development and have always had an interest in learning more about the web. So recently I took to learning (and building) a modern web architecture - including the backend elements. Everything I have learned broadly makes sense to me - except *authentication*.\n\nWhat I've found is that common architectures use API *tokens* post-auth. So users authenticate with the backend and are given what is commonly referred to as *access* tokens (and possibly *refresh* tokens alongside it). The *access* token is then expected to be present in all future web requests often in a header like so:\n\n`Authorization: Bearer <token>`\n\nBut *why*? Why make your frontends more complex by requiring them to manage token persistence? Not requiring the user to login on each visit is the expected UX these days. But you get that ***implicitly*** with cookies, so I don't understand the need for API tokens at all.\n\n*\\*\\* And if the API is expected to be used with something other than a browser (e.g. some python code or whatnot) the semantics do not really change all that much. Perhaps even in this scenario the \\`Authorization\\` header makes sense .. but supporting this in the backend is trivial. My argument is mostly about the added complexity to a frontend.*\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The scenarios are:\n\n**For token-based auth:**\n\n1. User visits webpage\n2. Frontend queries localStorage for tokens to determine is user is authenticated\n3. In frontend: if authenticated goto 7 else render login form\n4. User authenticates with backend\n5. Backend sends API token in body of response\n6. Frontend stores token in e.g. localStorage (step 2 now will succeed and skip re-auth)\n7. Frontend renders authenticated pages\n8. For each subsequent request frontend explicitly sets \\`Authorization\\` header with token\n\n**For cookie-based auth:**\n\n1. User visits webpage\n2. Frontend queries e.g. /api/users/whoami on first render (browser sends any cookies present)\n3. Backend reads/validates cookies and responds with some body content indicating auth (or not)\n4. In frontend: if authenticated goto 8 else render login form\n5. User authenticates with backend\n6. Backend sets auth cookie and responds with success message\n7. Browser implicitly retains cookie  (step 2 now will succeed and skip re-auth)\n8. Frontend renders authenticated pages\n9. For each subsequent request frontend does nothing (cookies are implicitly sent by browser)\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# How I see their securities stack up:\n\n**Token-based:**\n\n* XSS can read localStorage and exfiltrate the token (there are ways to mitigate this)\n* XSS can just use its execution to make authenticated API requests\n* No cookies, no CSRF\n\n**Cookie-based**\n\n* XSS can just use its execution to make authenticated API requests\n* Has cookies, but (should be) using \\`HttpOnly\\`/\\`Samesite\\`/\\`Secure\\` mitigates CRSF\n\nNot to mention with cookie-based auth your frontend can be simpler by offloading auth management to the backend, effectively; the \"on first render\" request instructs the frontend on if it should attempt to render authenticate pages or just redirect to the login page (due to bad/corrupted/expired credentials). Whereas with the token-based approach you have added XSS attack surface *and* are necessarily adding more complexity to your frontend.\n\nIf you opt to use something like request interceptors, or web workers to isolate access to your token by retaining it in-memory (and so XSS cannot explicitly *read* it out for exfiltration) then the token-based approach improves to be roughy equivalent with the cookie-based auth anyway (i.e. the first bullet does not apply).\n\n**The** ***only*** **downside I see to cookie-based auth as described above is that your frontend is required to make a web request on first render** to e.g. /api/users/whoami in order to determine its user data and whether or not the backend has validated the authenticated session. It is conceivable that at-scale these extra web requests may be undesirable.\n\nAgain, I am quite new to web development but this is something that stuck out to me during my studies. I have no issue being wrong here - but I simply do to understand the benefit of token-based authentication. Before \\`HttpOnly\\` and \\`SameSite\\` were a thing, and use of cookies was very insecure, I do understand the motivation. But given modern mitigations I just don't quite see the intent.",

This server client direct relationship isn't always the case In bigger more complex enterprise architecture.\n\nJWT authentication can be more flexible and is good in situations where you have multiple APIs, multiple different pages or mobile apps using the same APIs.\n\nFor example. A large company might have 8 different APIs maintained by different teams written in different languages. A company like this will roll one authentication server that deals with all the Auth and dishes out all the tokens. That means once you have a token you have a common interface to communicate with all the APIs securely. \n\nThere are patterns that involve an API gateway that acts as the front door to all of your APIs. Cookie based is very limiting in what you can achieve. JWT means that pretty much anything can call your APIs securely not just browsers.\n\nCookies don't work in Native apps too. The process you are used to with the apps on your phone keeping you logged in is a JWT refresh Oauth flow. It would mean maintaining an Auth server on top of a cookie based Auth flow for your webpage. Which doesn't make sense so you just use JWT and either Oauth/OpenID etc for everything. \n\nTo summarize cookies great, secure easy. Token based is way more flexible/interoperable but probably worse in every other aspect.",

I use API tokens for backend to backend communication, but I think in most cases frontend to backend is better handled with cookies and a simple text token (not a JWT).\n\nedit : one valid usecase is if you build a mobile app that will consume the same api as your website, since your mobile app most likely can't use cookies.",

Instead of a Cookie header the api sends an authentication header. No big woop. Especially since the JS uses a library to handle the messy details of acquiring tokens (MSAL.js... I've said too much).\n\nIf we were to try to use cookies... our SPA would need to be hosted on the same origin as the API. Pretty tricky... our API is hidden behind an application firewall (Azure API Mgmt... I've said too much). We can control the domain name of it... but I think we'd run into issues with serving the SPA from the same origin. Do cookies pay attention to subdomain? They must... which means we'd have to serve the SPA through API Mgmt... yuck.\n\nSo... cookies just won't work.",

You have to jump through a lot of hoops to propagate them cross-domain, and the whole mechanism doesn't really make sense anyway since state is no longer backend-driven.\n\nIn the modern approach frontends are standalone apps. They maintain their own state, they can work with multiple backends simultaneously. The APIs are considered mere data sources and data stores, and the frontend gets to decide what data it pulls from where and how it uses it.\n\nIn this approach you don't need and don't want a complex self-propagating cookie mechanism with lots of side-effects. All you want is \"does this API require authentication\" and if so \"here's a key granting me access\".\n\nHow and where you obtain that key can be further delegated to any number of mechanisms, it's not tied to one backend like before.

I wouldn’t care that much honestly, but if I were building my own system that’s what I would tend toward.",

HTTP-only cookies are one way to handle authentication and have certain advantages. They are relatively simple to implement and automatically included with every HTTP request made from the client to the server. They also provide some protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks since they can’t be accessed via JavaScript.\n\nHowever, token-based authentication (JWT for instance) is also popular and has its own advantages. It is often used in RESTful APIs due to its statelessness and scalability. It can be used across different domains, and it’s flexible to work with mobile, web, or other third-party applications. Token auth is also more suitable for single-page applications (SPAs), where the server doesn’t need to keep track of sessions, making it more efficient and scalable.\n\nIn the end, whether to use token-based authentication or cookie-based authentication often depends on the specific needs and context of your application.”",

This means the user has requested to store the cookie to stay logged in for a longer time.\n\nIf the user doesn’t click the \"Remember Me\" checkbox, then they can only stay logged in until they close the browser or remain inactive for some time. After that, it will ask them to reauthenticate again because no cookie was saved, and the session has expired.\n\nNow, let’s say the user deletes that cookie ID from their browser. In that case, the user only loses the extended login time (the \"Remember Me\" plan). They will still stay logged in until the session expires.\n\nPersonally, I think the original asker should consider this: if their program didn’t receive a cookie in its HTTP request, the user might have logged in from a public internet connection and chose not to save the cookie by not checking the \"Remember Me\" checkbox. Or, if the user is familiar with the browser’s developer tools, they might have accidentally checked the \"Remember Me\" option but later deleted the cookie ID to stay safe.\n\nAnyway, cookies and sessions are very different. A cookie is just a key stored on the user’s device, which we use to identify them. A session is similar to a cookie but is only active until the browser or device is closed or not used for a certain period.\n\nOn each request, my program checks if a session is found. If not, it checks if a cookie is found. If a cookie is found, it re-creates the session and lets the user stay logged in again. That’s how most apps and websites work to let you log in seamlessly when you come back after days.",

Cookies are a part of that, but in reality, cookies are only mentioned 3 times in the whole GDPR. There are other ways to track users, such as fingerprinting, and this also goes against the GDPR if there is not informed consent.\n\nWhat it does say can be boiled down to a few simple points though:\n\n* Tracking should be an informed opt-in. This would mean that without action, tracking users is not enabled. Cookies are obviously the main way to be tracked, but that doesn't mean that all cookies are being used for that. Just show the option to opt-in to those tracking cookies that are used, anything that the site relies on for functionality are fine.\n* Opting out should be as easy as opting in. So, if you have some kind of 'accept all' button, you need a similar 'reject all' button as well.\n\nBeyond that, there are a lot of ways to approach these things with good UX in mind. Also, good UX will have a lot of overlap with decent accessibility as well. I wrote an article about this earlier in the year, but I don't think the rules allow me to post the link. Basically, follow these points:\n\n* Try to make it an inline thing or a banner, rather than a popup modal. Modals are not great for accessibility, and if you followed the GDPR requirements, the user should not be forced to accept/reject being tracked anyway, as it's opt-in by action as the default.\n* Don't disguise the buttons as tiny links.\n* Don't force the user to have to click through a hundred individual radio buttons/toggles to change their preferences.\n* Legitimate interest is greatly abused and misused by advertisers, just avoid it.\n* Changing preferences should be as easy to opt out as to opt in.\n* For accessibility purposes, make sure that any of the interactive parts are keyboard accessible, have the right accessible labels (added via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`), and have the right accessible roles (best to use the correct existing HTML elements where possible, otherwise you can use `role` to fill in the gaps)\n* A final point on the accessibility, try to avoid only colours to indicate meaning. The biggest offenders I see for this are cookie banners with toggles where the toggle just changes colour when switching between on/off modes. Depending on different types of colour blindness, that toggle change might be effectively invisible.",

                "body": "JWTs are great. They solve some very specific problems in a really clever way. What they aren’t, is easy to deal with.\n\nSo if you don’t have those problems and are not likely to ever have those problems, you don’t need JWTs.\n\nThese are the problems:\n\nImagine you are building a complicated application, for example a video streaming service like Netflix. You don’t build it as a monolith, instead you have a load of smaller services.\n\nYou have an authentication server. You have a server which handles account settings and billing. You have a recommendation service that gives personalised recommendations, and you have a DRM service that grants keys. And you don’t use JWTs.\n\nWhat happens when a user logs in to watch a video?\n\nFred Bloggs logs in so the app makes a request to the auth server with his username and password.\n\nThe auth server checks the username and password. So creates a row in a table with Fred's user ID and a session token.\n\nThe token is a GUID, it has no meaning, but it is the identifier for the logged in session.\n\nThe app gets the session token and then makes a request to the billing server to ensure that Fred is still paid up.\n\nThe server gets the token, it then makes a request to the auth server to find out who that is. The auth server looks up the session in the database and responds that it is Fred. The billing server then checks its own database for Fred’s account and confirms to the app that Fred is signed up\n\nThe app then hits the recommendation service with the token to get a list of recommended shows/most recently watched so that it can render the menu. The recommendation service takes the token and makes a request to auth to see who that belongs to. Once it knows it is Fred, it generates the appropriate response for him.\n\nFred chooses a particular video. The app makes a request to the DRM service which hits auth to find out who owns that token, once it knows it is Fred, it makes a request to the billing service to verify that Fred has a valid subscription for that video, once it has confirmed this, it generates the appropriate keys to return to the app.\n\nFred now watches his video.\n\nYou’ll notice that there was an awful lot of one service making requests to other services. The auth service spent more time responding to request asking “who is this person” than it did actually authenticating.\n\nThis is what JWT solves. Instead of responding with a meaningless token, the auth server responds with a bit of information that says “this is Fred Bloggs, He is user ID 987654321. He has a subscription to the all-access plan valid until 31st January 2025” and then digitally signs that so that whoever gets the token can simply verify the signature and immediately have that information and know it is correct.\n\nThat saves much of the communication between servers, and indeed, if the Auth server goes offline after Fred has logged in, it doesn’t matter, as he can still use his current token until it expires.\n\nNow if you don’t have multiple services, then JWT doesn’t solve any problems for you - you don’t need it.\n\nMany (arguably most) web applications happily run on a single server and often the database is on the same server, so latency for database lookups is tiny. In these cases using a simple session system that most web frameworks provide is quite sufficient\n\nTLDR: You probably don't need JWT, just use your frameworks session/token system instead.",

Cookie is simply a mechanism for storing tokens in the browser, and local storage is another way browsers store information.\n\nAt their core, both JWT and session provide users with a credential for identity verification.  \nThe difference is that session records this credential and its corresponding user relationship on the server. So if you want to invalidate the credential, you can simply delete the corresponding relationship.\n\nJWT uses a secret key to sign the credential, and only the server possesses this key. This ensures users cannot modify the credential, eliminating the need for the server to store the credential-user relationship and thus reducing server workload.  \nHowever, the drawback is that the credential cannot be invalidated at will.\n\nAnother characteristic of JWT is that, although it appears random, anyone can decode and view the content recorded in the JWT—but they cannot modify it.\n\nYou can encode and decode JWTs on the following website:  \n[https://jwtdecode.pro/](https://jwtdecode.pro/)  \nYou'll notice that decoding a JWT doesn’t require a secret key, but encoding does.  \nThis means everyone can see the information inside a JWT.\n\nIn contrast, session-stored information can be encrypted. The server then decrypts it when retrieving session data via cookies.  \nHowever, in most cases, a session simply stores a meaningless random string, and the server can query the corresponding user from a lookup table.\n\nIn practice, many sessions also adopt JWT's signing mechanism.

There are two keys in this, a private key (held only on the auth server) which is used to sign it, and a public key which is held on all other services, and it doesn't matter if it is leaked, since you can't do anything harmful with it. It is a little harder to set up, but only marginally.\n\nFor revocation you would generally use a system where the token is not terribly long lived - maybe 10 minutes, and you have a renewal mechanism whereby a client with an expired token can exchange it for a new one with the auth server. That is where revocation can be checked and the auth server can refuse to issue a new token, forcing the user to re-log in.

With cookies, it's impossible to say with 100% certainty that a cookie is used for tracking (names and domains can be changed at a whim), and many of the browser features used for tracking and fingerprinting have valid non-tracking uses. Like, a browser might block requests to hotjar tracking endpoint, but hotjar can just update the domain or claim that this is not tracking per se, but *justified gathering of anonymous usage data with a solid business reasoning backing it up,* and pursue it as a legal matter. Probably no-one wants to open that can of worms.\n\nSo apart from asking explicit permission for 3rd party cookies, the other alternative is what Apple Appstore is doing and 1) perform semi-manual approval of the app (website in this case) to ensure only the allowed types of tracking take place 2) present users with option to not be tracked (\"Ask app to not track\" on iOS).

A site that breaks because a browser blocks autoplay is inherently broken, it's not the browser breaking it, so that's 100% fine by me.\n\nRealistically:\n\n- Cookie popups should be replaced by web standards by which browsers can get user input about tracking consent in a standardized way. This way, a user can configure their browser to either reject anything outright without further explicit interactions, or give it *carte blanche* for allowing certain types of tracking, or make it show them a standardized UI on a per-case basis. After all, the decision is really always the same: given these categories of tracking information and purposes, which of these are you consenting to? Having a different UI for each site is detrimental to the user experience, often misleading, and unnecessarily disruptive.\n\nThere are browser plugins that approximate this behavior somewhat, by detecting common consent popups and automatically declining consent for you, but they only work for popups that follow a known pattern, which IME is about half of them. Introducing web standards to replace those custom popups, and making their use \"mandatory\" (if not by law, then through some kind of industry pressure, such as SEO punishment), could make this a complete non-issue, without going so far as to making tracking illegal entirely.",

Specifically look at the Request Headers. You'll see your user agent string, any cookies associated with the website's domain, and more. Every byte of that header is sent to the web server and every user's browser will send similar, but different data.\n\nYour server could take that data, normalize it and hash it, and you'd get a naive fingerprint of the visitor. But that's not enough to uniquely identify returning visitors. With a large enough user base, multiple users could produce the same fingerprint. Further, if the user changes some browser settings, their requests headers could change. That's what happens if they delete their cookies. They could use a different browser, or go incognito. The headers might change when the browser software updates. And so on. \n\nSo you have to go deeper.\n\nYou could write some JavaScript that runs on the user's browser, then observe its behavior. For example, you can have the browser transcode a short audio sample then hash the results. This will produce different results for different users. ~~Or you could time how long their browser takes to perform a series of computations, the results of which are affected by their particular mix of hardware, browser software and operating system.~~ You might be able to interrogate which browser features are enabled or which extensions are installed. All of those things could be used to help identify a user.\n\nBut all of those things are unreliable, and many of them could be considered invasive. \n\nIf your business model relies on this, then you should know the technique might work well enough for many users, but it won't work reliably for all users. Be sure it's legal, and decide if it's moral.\n\nEdit: strike out an oversimplification.",

        "author": "BornEze",
        "id": "1kpsut3",
        "selftext": "What's up guys. Been doing some research and cookies and how to secure them with my website I'm building, and I think I got a pretty good solution down pat. But I wanted some opinions on one specific element that's been bugging me...\n\n**TLDR - What if someone's auth cookie (remember me) that they get once successfully logged in, to access and interact with the website, is stolen.** Then the attacker can basically use that cookie to pose as User A to the server, and then do whatever malicious things they want with that account on my website.\n\nTrying to prevent that.\n\n\n\n**Essentially I have a log in system that works like this:**\n\n1. User logs in to the website with username/email and password\n2. Password provided is then hashed and compared against the hashed password thats stored in my database (hashed with a salt and pepper) - to confirm login combo\n3. If the password is successfully verified then the user is granted an `Auth Token` cookie from my website. The token is a random string thats 250 characters in length. Numbers, Letters, and Symbols - case sensitive. Its sent back and stored as a cookie. `setcookie(\"token\", \"Random String\", $CookieOptions);` \n4. That token is added to a Database - `Active_User_Sessions` with a current timestamp, last updated timestamp, and information about the user that just logged in: `IP Address, ISP, State, City, User Agent, Browser Name, Browser Version, List of Headers from the browser`. Along with their corresponding User ID.\n5. Then the user can browse the website successfully, managing their account, performing actions and what not.\n\n\n\nI have the cookies and headers set with these security settings on my site to help prevent sniffing, PHP:\n\n**On my config.php**\n\n    //Headers\n    header(\"Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'\");\n    header(\"Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload\");\n    \n    //set some secure paramters for user session\n    ini_set('session.use_only_cookies', 1);\n    ini_set('session.use_strict_mode', 1);\n    ini_set('session.cookie_httponly', 1);\n    \n    session_set_cookie_params([\n        'lifetime' => 0,\n        'domain' => 'mywebsite.net',\n        'path' => '/',\n        'secure' => true,\n        'httponly' => true,\n    ]);\n\n**Used every time I make and update a cookie:**\n\n    $CookieOptions = array (\n        'expires' => time()+(86400*30), //30 days \n        'path' => '/', \n        'domain' => 'mywebsite.net', \n        'secure' => true,    \n        'httponly' => true,    \n        'samesite' => 'Strict' \n    );\n\n  \nNow, anytime the user accesses any page once logged in, or performs any action on the website - their request is then checked using that `Auth Token` cookie that was stored when they first logged in, to make sure its a valid user thats logged in making the request. \n\n\n\n**Basically, here's how that works:**\n\n1. User browsers page or does something; like changes their profile picture or loads up their shopping list for example\n2. Request is sent with the `Auth Token` cookie\n3. `Auth Token` cookie is then searched for in that Database I mentioned earlier, - `Active_User_Sessions` . If that `Auth Token`  is returned, then we can see what User ID it corresponds to and we know that the request coming through is valid for an active user that logged in. (Otherwise if no results are found for the searched cookie then its not valid and the script will throw an error and prevent that request from going through.)\n4. The server then allows the request to continue on my script once validated - and then afterwards a new Random Value is generated for the token of that row in the `Active_User_Sessions` database. Its then updated, along with the last active timestamp, and the `Auth Token` cookie is also updated with this new value as well.\n5. User can continue on doing what they want, and after 30 days the `Auth Token` cookie they have on the browser will expire and ill have a cronjob clean out old session rows that are 30 days old or older as well in the `Active_User_Sessions` database\n6. Rinse and repeat. All good right? Not quite.\n\n\n\nNow my issue is if someone, **User B**, were to steal another users `Auth Token` cookie, **User A**, after they leave the site. Since they wouldn't be doing anything else, or taking any actions, that last `Auth Token` cookie would hold the same value until they visit the site again. Thus, giving **User B** time to use it for a fake authentication and then effectively kicking out **User A**'s valid session since its value would then change in the database.\n\nI've thought about how to prevent this by recording users certain data to make a footprint when they logged in, as mentioned earlier with the `IP Address, ISP, State, City, User Agent, Browser Name, Browser Version, List of Headers from the browser` begin stored.\n\nI could compare not only the `Auth Token` cookie, but this information coming in with the request to further be sure its the same person sending the cookie that originally logged in. \n\nHowever..., IP Addresses change, User Agents can be spoofed, and etc etc etc. So I ***KNOW*** its not a good way to do so - but its pretty much all I got to ensure that the same person who logged in is sending the legitimately. Pretty much the only reliable thing there would be the IP address. But if the user is switching between mobile network/wifi or has a dynamic IP there goes that. Also if someones cookie is sniffed then im sure the request headers will be sniffed too.\n\n  \nNow I've been doing research on how to prevent cookie sniffing, xss attacks, and all that - so I'm doing my best and obviously cant prevent this from happening if someone's actual device is stolen and being used, but I'm wanting to make things as secure as possible - just without being a hinderance to the user.\n\n  \nRecently saw these two posts here that I thought could help with this, a selector and validator:\n\n[Improved Persistent Login Cookie Best Practice | Barry Jaspan](https://web.archive.org/web/20180819014446/http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice)\n\n[Implementing Secure User Authentication in PHP Applications with Long-Term Persistence (Login with \"Remember Me\" Cookies) - Paragon Initiative Enterprises Blog](https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/04/secure-authentication-php-with-long-term-persistence)\n\nHowever, I'm still not 100% sure how that works or would benefit my situation specifically. I got confused reading it because if someone were to again, just steal the cookie - they would have valid data that the website would see as an authenticated user. Unless this method is just to prevent timing attacks or DOS attacks when the database is comparing strings? Read about that a little bit too, but thats something I dont know anything about so this whole idea confused me entirely.\n\n  \nFigured I'd post here and get some insight. Trying not to reinvent the wheel, but I haven't had much luck finding anything about this. Thanks. ",

Your solution is subject to race conditions, for example if a user opens multiple tabs at the same time, and the expected cookie value changes in the database between requests being initated and the cookie being looked up. There is absolutely no need for a cookie to have 150 characters. \n\n\nA user will also have to be able to have multiple active sessions on different devices. But yes, rotating the session id will usually be enough - and if the country routing changes continents, send them an email notifying them of the change and request a confirmation link to be clicked (unless your app is such a app which would be used in a situation where someone arrives in a new country without access to email). Also - browser type can usually be safely attached to the session, as a new session would be created in another browser. \n\n\nYou'll never be able to make it perfect, so just keep it simple-ish enough. \n\n\nWhat you are going to experience is that the cookies won't leak, but the users will have re-used their passwords from public leaks, and their accounts will be victims to password stuffing instead.

                "body": "Hmm. I had a reply that I was going to post, mentioning that since sessions expire on browser close out, that wouldn't it better to stick with the cookie? But then I did some more search on this topic and just general security as a whole for website management regarding cookies and sessions. And I've come up a basically checklist/methodology that should give me the best security, but without being a hassle for end users.\n\nI specifically tried to keep in mind the scaling issue that you brought up, which makes sense - just hadn't thought of it.\n\nA lot of what I've been finding/reading points back to this article and to use cookies for a prolonged remember me feature. - [Implementing Secure User Authentication in PHP Applications with Long-Term Persistence (Login with \"Remember Me\" Cookies) - Paragon Initiative Enterprises Blog](https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/04/secure-authentication-php-with-long-term-persistence#title.2.1)\n\n# So here's what I've deduced:\n\n`Secure Cookies` \\- Make sure they're only sent over HTTPs so its encrypted and not in plain text\n\n`HTTPOnly`  \\- Prevent XSS - block scripts from reading the cookies\n\n`SameSite Strict` \\- Prevent other sites from sending requests with cookies, block malicious requests (CSRF attacks) and some other XSS attacks as well\n\n`Regenerate Session ID` \\- New session with a new id every x minutes and delete the old session, helps prevents session fixation so an attacker cant potential grab an active session\n\n`Timing Attacks and Preventing cookie leaking if database got breached` \\- Pair each Token with a Key or Verifier that's hashed in the database, but stored as plain text alongside the token data in the cookie - use the token as the selector for the current session the user is sending, then compare the hashed version of the key with what's stored in the database to validate the request. The hash comparisons stops timing attacks and the hashed key prevents an attacker from using any of the active sessions to impersonate any user *(though I don't know why i cant just store the hash of the token in both the database and the cookie and just do a search for it that way? Unless its because you shouldn't store the sensitive data like that and that would just bring it back to a timing attack issue and there would also be no need to hash in that case since im just doing a string to string comparison for the search, which again just goes back to beginning idea and -* ***ahhh ok, nvm now it finally \\*snaps fingers\\* clicks***\\*)\\*\n\n`Compare IP and Browser Name, Operating System, and OS Version`, at the minimum, with the requests when they come through with a valid cookie.\n\n\\>>>> If the cookie data matched **but the sending request country or state doesn't match**, flag/lock the account and clear all the active sessions for that user, notify user via email with a link to unlock their account - potential cookie theft just occurred, last resort of security of all else fails.\n\n`Every 5 minutes have the auth token get regenerated` on the next successful request from the user - this prevents any collisions from happening if on EVERY result I had kept it to change the token value like i did before - resulting in a user potentially blocking themselves should multiple tabs or requests be sent at the same time either through their own actions or background ajax requests. This, in theory, would cut down the chances of collisions like that happening a lot. While also keeping it secure like the sessions since the token would be changing every so often. The only downside, again, is if a user leaves the site before the next 5 minutes are up then the token stays the same until the next visit - leaving it vulnerable to a successful database return in the active sessions, if it somehow were to get stolen. But that's what the IP and other user info (state, country, browser, os, os version) comparisons would be for - to help stop that issue somewhat.\n\n`If user resets password` \\- clear all active sessions in the database\n\n`Users are required to have a minimum password length of 12 characters` \\- numbers, letters, symbols, no maximum character length (or maybe something like 1000 characters) - for added basic security\n\n`When users sign up, check the password they're about to use through a list of the most common passwords` and warn them that it was found in a data breach and either prevent them from using it, or warn them not to if the accept the risks.  Would just be a basic text file list comparison.\n\n`Limit user active sessions` to somewhere reasonable like 5 or 10.\n\nOf course nothing is **100% secure**,  (and again im probably just overthinking shit) but this I think is the best I can do that would at least provide a solid ground for security. I just like for things to be as secure as possible, with a balance of course...\n\nBut yea if a users device is stolen, infected with malware, or they connect to a shit public network and get exposed to a MTM attack, then I can't do shit about that. But I'll do my damnest on my end at least.",

                "body": "Usually in Web, the main worry is some third-party JS that can \"see\" what you put in localStorage and therefore exfiltrate things like JWTs kept there. \"httpOnly\" cookies are kept by the browser in a separate location that front-end JS has no access to, so they can't be stolen that way. Over the years we've seen so-called \"supply chain\" attacks where supposedly-trusted JS assets (see [https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/2024-polyfill-supply-chain-attack-what-to-know](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/2024-polyfill-supply-chain-attack-what-to-know) for an example) get compromised and attackers inject code that steals tokens/session IDs. So in Web the current best-practice is httpOnly cookies that can't be accessed by those scripts.\n\nToken theft concerns are not as big a priority in mobile apps (through this vector, anyway). With some exceptions, they're much more tightly controlled environments provided you're talking a real native app, not a PWA, and there is almost never any third-party JS involved. There is really no practical value in terms of security in trying to use cookies in a mobile app. They're not wrong or worse, but a native mobile app has full access to both cookies and standard headers (cookies are just another header, really) so using cookies doesn't add any value and it's kind of a clumsy format (semi-colon delimited key=value string). The only time we really do it is if we're connecting to an existing (typically legacy) backend that already provides that mechanism for Web, and offers no other option. The standard in mobile is an Authorization header, typically using Bearer-tokens.\n\nBut in mobile apps you **do** still need to be thoughtful about where you store these tokens / session IDs. Typically we use something like Keychain/Keystore to provide secure storage, and you can tell when an app is doing that when it also offers TouchID/FaceID because those services are what actually do that. The app itself doesn't actually read your fingerprint. When you store a value, you can mark it with flags that tell the OS biometric auth is required for retrieval, and the OS itself challenges the user for their biometrics. It's a very strong system.\n\nWith that setup usually we'll only store one value - the refresh token. We (I, anyway) don't store access/id tokens. Instead, when the app starts, a call gets made to see if there's a refresh token. If there is, a call is made to the backend with that to obtain a fresh access token for that session. The refresh token is then invalidated (and discarded from memory) and a fresh one is stored, and also discarded from memory. This process isn't really as critical these days, but it was an old school best practice to prevent token theft due to system-level compromises where attackers could read what's in RAM. It's one of those \"very very hard, but not actually **impossible**\" things so why not be careful? It's easy enough.",

They are different concepts:\n\n- A login session keeps track of the authenticated user (\"currently logged in user\")\n- A session cookie in the context of cookie types keeps track of information while the browser/tab is open and looses it when closed\n- A session cookie in the context of a web application is a cookie that contains a session ID that the backend can use to identify the visitor (let's call this a session ID cookie to prevent confusion)\n\nWe can use a cookie to implement a login session. We can also use the [Authorization header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization).\n\nIf we use a session cookie to implement the login session, then user is logged out when the browser closes. If we use a cookie with expiration timestamp, then the user is logged out when the time expires.\n\nWe can also implement a login session using a session ID cookie. The backend then keeps a link between session ID and user ID and looks up the user by reading the session ID from the session ID cookie.\n\nHope this clears it up a bit.",

If the user has already stepped-up the authentication they won't reprompt for MFA again. As an attacker, if you steal a session that's been stepped up you can go to town and do whatever you like.\n\nThere's also the suggestion of tying the session to the IP as well. IP can change pretty frequently but you can at least limit it to the geographical location. So if the session you used in the US is suddenly being used somewhere in Europe the session would get terminated. This would have the downside of breaking sessions when using VPNs though. Also, if someone has landed malware on your computer sometimes they can use it as a proxy to access the website so geo tagging would not help you since the connection to YouTube would still be coming out of your PC. Although it would make exploitation harder which is essentially what security is all about.",

There's another type of attack called Cross Site Request Forgery (or CSRF for short) which you may have heard of. This particular one tends to be used to trick users into performing an action that they never intended (there was an old website called Log Me Out which took advantage of this in a non destructive way, but it no longer works due to CSRF mitigation).

The redirection happens on the server side.* ***So, if you want this to work on mobile browsers, use the \"Request Desktop Site\" feature.***\n\nFor example,\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuB8VUICGqc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuB8VUICGqc) // will occasionally show ads\n\n[https://www.youtube.com./watch?v=DuB8VUICGqc](https://www.youtube.com./watch?v=DuB8VUICGqc) // will not show ads\n\nIt's a commonly forgotten edge case, websites forget to normalize the hostname, the content is still served, but there's no hostname match on the browser so no cookies and broken CORS - and lots of bigger sites use a different domain to serve ads/media with a whitelist that doesn't contain the extra dot\n\nThis works for many news websites as well serving paywalls, e.g.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/09/us/george-floyd-who-is.html](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/09/us/george-floyd-who-is.html)",

Let me try with an extreme example.\n\nLets say you run a site called GeminiiNews.com. It's fairly successful, you break even after salaries and expenses and your income comes from advertising like a vast majority of online news sites. Your ad blocker rate is around 20% (the rough average though it varies by industry) but you make enough to get by. Lets hypothetically say Chrome has a built in ad blocker now that's on by default; Google would never but this is to demonstrate the point. Your income would obviously drop off a cliff. You see your competitors, other news sites, are also dropping off in ad revenue. After all, what advertiser would want to be on your site if the ads aren't ever going to show?\n\nSo now your main source of revenue is out. Now every visitor is no longer a chance at revenue (roughly 80% chance before) but is now almost certainly just an expense in bandwidth and server resources. \n\nSo you only allow people without the ad blocker on you use your site, and this might work if all of the other sites do this too. But the other option is now everything is behind a paywall. Now there is virtually no free news other than sites specifically for propaganda (they are just there for misinformation and not revenue anyhow), and only those who have money can get access to news.\n\nNow those would be the business choices of the owner that you would be okay with, but eventually the common denominator keeps dropping until that's the only way expenses can be paid: behind a paywall or overturn the ad blocking movement. Then it's not a matter of just going somewhere else, society's information has now been pay-walled and the internet is now a place for those who can afford it, and have access to internet, and can also afford the access; it was bad enough when the problem was just the last two.\n\nMy larger point is that advertising, and the understanding of \"You show me ads, I get your content/service\" is what made the modern internet possible today by giving everyone a way to get access without having to shell out cash. And this goes beyond just internet services. There have been huge ups and downs with virus attack vectors and such, but a lot of that (at least for now) is a minimal concern with modern browsers and operating systems. The ad blocker movement, from where I sit, if it keeps growing has the only inevitable conclusion that not only will ISPs charge, but they also content providers, making the disenfranchised even more so.",

The ‘implied contract’ theory that we’ve agreed to view ads in exchange for free content is void because we can’t review the terms first — as soon as we follow a link, our browsers load, execute, transfer, and track everything embedded by the publisher. Our data, battery life, time, and privacy are taken by a blank check with no recourse.” Every time you visit a website with an ad, it's an implied contract, but since you cannot view all the terms its void and cannot be enforced.",

First, a lot of ad blockers look for key words, such as a div called \"ad-slot\" and they will block render of that div content. Second, almost no one at scale can do that. Even those not at scale won't.\n\nLets pretend we have giant company XYZ. They have many sites, many domains, many product, and therefore many ads. Even if they own and direct sell all of those ads (and they wouldn't, will get to that later) any logical architect will try to consolidate that ad delivery under something like ads.xyz.com. To have several independent ad delivery networks, or try to get clever with DNS around it, would be a nightmare. \n\nNext, companies as large as XYZ could afford to have their own ads team to manage inventory, sales, operations, etc. But even them an ad platform like Google Ad Manager will be extremely more efficient than whatever a company could make on their own. Almost all companies are moving to these platforms for ubiquity for them and the customers. \n\nBut even then if you are NOT a company as large as XYZ, you can't afford ad sales, ad ops, and making your own ad delivery platform and you rely on those third party ad delivery providers to do all that for you. Those providers are largely the reason why small sites can afford to support themselves.\n\nIt's a sticky situation, and I am sad bad ad experiences has ruined it sometimes, but I am still stuck that blocking ads is directly moving away from what can make the internet free and open.",

A few people used adblockers but they weren't mainstream. Once the advertisers started escalating they forced everyone to use blockers to make the web usable again.  They forced the genie out of the bottle and there's no way to put it back at this point.\n\nWith adblockers today I allow unobtrusive ads.

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nBeginner web developer and i'm going crazy, i hope this is correct place to ask.... Basically i'm making Spring Boot - Angular app, where on login endpoint i create a cookie with token and sending it back to frontend and browser if login succeeds. This all worked locally so far, no issue whatsoever.\n\nBut now, i'm trying to host this website through my friend's server (using cloudflare), using docker-compose which includes frontend, backend and mariadb database. While i had some issues with cors at first, it eventually got resolved, but now i reached the point where two weird things are happening:\n\n   * Http-cookie is not received. I put some logs around, no issue happening on token creation and cookie creation, no errors anywhere... but browser never gets the cookie and i can't figure out why.\n   * For some reason, logging in or any login attempt, successful or not only works once, afterwards i'm always getting Unauthorized error until i clear browser cache.\n\nBoth these problems only happen on my prod docker builds and i can't figure out what the problem is. I'll share some relevant code, feel free to ask for more code if needed, pls note that i'm not the most efficient coder yet so my code might not follow best practices atm (but any tips are welcome as i'm doing my best to improve)\n\nThis is angular's http call. Personally i don't think problem is in this, but maybe there is something i'm missing.\n\n[angular http call](https://preview.redd.it/hdcv48sbbfxe1.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd4bcb0af875c7fce92d8f9dfd8b331a15804096)\n\nNow for the backend. This is /login endpoint. This setup worked completely fine in local environment. It might be something with jwtCookie having something that is not accepted in https environment? But i tried changing setSecure and httpOnly to false, without success.\n\n[\\/login endpoint logic](https://preview.redd.it/0g1gcn4abfxe1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=e90486e50037c2845f13770f8a6ceaa05f1f144b)\n\nauthenticate function in service basically checks if user exists and then generates a token which is then saved into LoginResponseDTO and returned. We also tried some settings in cloudflare, as i read disabling caching on certain urls could help, but again, no success.\n\nAny suggestions pls? what am i missing :( I can send more code snippets or maybe even open github link if it would help identify what's wrong.\n\nThanks in advance",

It’s the analytics process that uses those cookies to feed into a massive network of data brokers/trackers to individually track you across many sites that’s the actual issue. Regulators I doubt would even care if you tracked a “user” on a single site just so you could present them info for that site (consistently between pages and sessions)….. but proving that’s how it’s being used is very difficult so they have forced this legislation at an easy enough level to enforce (are you using cookies? Ask the user).\n\nI actually don’t know if that’s the interpretation of the GDPR, it’s possible they make the distinction of when you need consent at a level that can’t be verified.\n\nNote that there are more modern techniques though like session and local storage which are much easier to verify (and even use really) whether or not you are being tracked as they don’t transmit info to the server unless explicitly coded out to do so. \n\nI work at an advertising agency and it’s mind boggling how many trackers they want installed. I’m like: there is no reason to be lining the pockets of 5 different data tracking companies because you don’t want to bother figuring out how to best utilize any one tool. Drives me crazy and kills site performance.\n\nSome of the modern trackers are crazy as well and use this network of data brokers to collect/coalesce info to the point they basically say to a site owner “oh hey, Bob is visiting your site again. Here is his phone number/email which we know cause he entered his info on a completely different site 6 months ago. Have fun using that info however you want. You probably shouldn’t call him as it will let him peek behind the curtain a little too much…. But you know… Here it is anyway cause the more you know we know the more you’ll feel in control of those otherwise random beeps/boops that hit your site”.\n\n\nAnd this is considered the legit side of the industry.

Then, there's the pictures with the step by step instructions, accidental pictures of John John's dirty bedroom and a Christmas party where Aunt Carmen showed up drunk and passed out on the toilet. Then the long list of what can and can't be substituted for those who suddenly have gluten allergies because a Google search of their symptoms says they are gluten free and possibly pregnant with a 3 eyed alien.  Gotta love Google MD.

If I want to log in, I will press the login button!\n\nYou go to a site, start reading, then 1/2 paragraph in, bang! A mother f'ing popup.\n\nSometimes it's a star rating, which will ALWAYS be 1 star if it came from a popup. This must be great for their ratings.\n\nPopup blockers are useless. They used to block new windows spawns, but nobody uses that method anymore. It's all scripting.\n\nWhat's needed is a script blocker that filters all of the script commands for popups only. I haven't seen a working one yet. You can't block all scripts, but you could block or comment out just the popup commands when they weren't called by a click. Maybe someone will come up with a working one some day.",

Likely suits that are not even going to be in the company very long. They're in there to make some kind of quick impact and then move on to the next job for a bigger salary, so they just make a mess of things in the short term. \n\nThis reminds me when I used to design emails for a major automaker, and these people within the agency, account people, they had no idea about design, all they wanted to do was keep putting in more buttons for every little thing. They wanted this email to go to 10 different places. I've seen the same attitude from both client and agency where they try to make an email do the work of a web page. They want to put all this crazy amount of information and buttons and links and everything else and then they wonder why the engagement and conversion is low. \n\nAll of these pop-ups is somebody listing all of the things that are so highly important in their eyes, and they just figure it's better to keep barraging the user with all this stuff to get at least a little bit of conversion from it. I think most competent ux people would probably tell them to prioritize something and go from there. \n\nLike I would rather tell them to decide what is most important. Their email list, their social media links, or whatever service or special thing they are trying to sell. Pick one and push that. That, or we make one thing come up and put the pitch on there. Get on our emailing list and social media and here's this thing we are pushing. \n\nActually, I would probably do the additional product push if they decide to get on our mailing list or something like that. I'd also make it the front and center of the social media in case they happen to click one of those links. Find that engaged user and then pitch them that product. \n\nTo this day, all these kinds of companies can't understand why many of us are using ad blockers. We would just like to navigate the internet without 8,000 things coming up in front of us attempting to steal our attention away. \n\nI mean, I would love to one day see some real data on digital advertising, and see if there's any effectiveness in it. To basically point out that everybody is wasting their money and annoying everybody and they're not going to get anywhere. \n\nI still feel like if your online business is all about ad revenue, then you might as well close up and quit. The more you have to keep barraging people with advertising to try to make that money, the more you're just going to annoy people and eventually they're going to tell everyone else and no one's going to bother. Already certain websites and URLs I see and I don't bother clicking because I know what to expect. That's not good if people are remembering your brand in a bad way.",

        "title": "ELI5: HTTP Authentication - Basic Auth, Bearer Auth and Cookie Auth",
        "author": "trolleid",
        "id": "1kndkjh",
        "selftext": "This is a _super brief_ explanation of them which can serve as a quick-remembering-guide for example. I also mention some connected topics to keep in mind without going into detail and there's a short code snippet. Maybe helpful for someone :-) The repo is: https://github.com/LukasNiessen/http-authentication-explained\n\n# HTTP Authentication: Simplest Overview\n\nBasically there are 3 types: Basic Authentication, Bearer Authentication and Cookie Authentication.\n\n## Basic Authentication\n\nThe simplest and oldest type - but it's insecure. So do not use it, just know about it.\n\nIt's been in HTTP since version 1 and simply includes the credentials in the request:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>\n```\n\nAs you see, we set the HTTP header _Authorization_ to the string `username:password`, encode it with base64 and prefix `Basic`. The server then decodes the value, that is, remove `Basic` and decode base64, and then checks if the credentials are correct. **That's all**.\n\nThis is obviously insecure, even with HTTPS. If an attacker manages to 'crack' just one request, you're done.\n\nStill, we need HTTPS when using Basic Authentication (eg. to protect against eaves dropping attacks). Small note: Basic Auth is also vulnerable to CSRF since the browser caches the credentials and sends them along subsequent requests automatically.\n\n## Bearer Authentication\n\nBearer authentication relies on security tokens, often called bearer tokens. The idea behind the naming: the one bearing this token is allowed access.\n\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n\nHere we set the HTTP header _Authorization_ to the token and prefix it with `Bearer`.\n\nThe token usually is either a JWT (JSON Web Token) or a session token. Both have advantages and disadvantages - I wrote a separate article about this.\n\nEither way, if an attacker 'cracks' a request, he just has the token. While that is bad, usually the token expires after a while, rendering is useless. And, normally, tokens can be revoked if we figure out there was an attack.\n\nWe need HTTPS with Bearer Authentication (eg. to protect against eaves dropping attacks).\n\n## Cookie Authentication\n\nWith cookie authentication we leverage cookies to authenticate the client. Upon successful login, the server responds with a Set-Cookie header containing a cookie name, value, and metadata like expiry time. For example:\n\n```\nSet-Cookie: JSESSIONID=abcde12345; Path=/\n```\n\nThen the client must include this cookie in subsequent requests via the _Cookie_ HTTP header:\n\n```\nCookie: JSESSIONID=abcde12345\n```\n\nThe cookie usually is a token, again, usually a JWT or a session token.\n\nWe need to use HTTPS here.\n\n## Which one to use?\n\nNot Basic Authentication! 😄 So the question is: Bearer Auth or Cookie Auth?\n\nThey both have advantages and disadvantages. This is a topic for a separate article but I will quickly mention that bearer auth must be protected against XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and Cookie Auth must be protected against CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery). You usually want to set your sensitive cookies to be Http Only. But again, this is a topic for another article.\n\n## Example of Basic Auth in Java\n\n```Java\nimport java.net.HttpURLConnection;\nimport java.net.URL;\nimport java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;\nimport java.util.Base64;\n\npublic class BasicAuthClient {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            String username = \"demo\";\n            String password = \"p@55w0rd\";\n            String credentials = username + \":\" + password;\n            String encodedCredentials = Base64.getEncoder()\n                .encodeToString(credentials.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));\n\n            URL url = new URL(\"https://api.example.com/protected\");\n            HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n            conn.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\n            conn.setRequestProperty(\"Authorization\", \"Basic \" + encodedCredentials);\n\n            int responseCode = conn.getResponseCode();\n            System.out.println(\"Response Code: \" + responseCode);\n\n            if (responseCode == 200) {\n                System.out.println(\"Success!

Login failed.\");\n                return;\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"Received cookie: \" + cookie);\n\n            // Step 2: Use cookie for protected request\n            URL protectedUrl = new URL(\"https://example.com/protected\");\n            HttpURLConnection protectedConn = (HttpURLConnection) protectedUrl.openConnection();\n            protectedConn.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\n            protectedConn.setRequestProperty(\"Cookie\", cookie);\n\n            int responseCode = protectedConn.getResponseCode();\n            System.out.println(\"Response Code: \" + responseCode);\n\n            if (responseCode == 200) {\n                System.out.println(\"Success!

You're not attacking me, you're just being ignorant. \n\nWhat I'm working on is effectively a location-specific corporate management platform. Users will almost effusively be working from computers within a specific building. The features being protected are eg creating new members for an org and modifying permissions. The system is effectively just a little more lenient/convenient than having to re-authenticate with every such action. If eg the IP address didn't match, the user simply has to re-authenticate and generate a new token. \n\nUsers riding on trains is not a concern. Users moving more than 100 ft probably won't happen. And if something does invalidate the token, all they have to do is re-authenticate. Not really so different from how secure/sensitive operations are handled everywhere.\n\nMatching IP address is only used for the select requests that demand high security. If I could figure out how to revoke such turns when their screen locks, I would. \n\nAnd, though I never even implied I thought it to be a silver bullet, it is still enhanced security and another layer of security. The point is that, even if all else fails, for the most critical things these tokens still cannot really feasibly be used if somehow stolen. \n\nAnd yes, there are still ways of stealing such cookies, even without a device being fully compromised. Various attacks have been executed that just require opening a crafted PDF attachment, for example. I don't quite know how that works because I don't really do much with PDF, but that was a common attack within the last year, I believe. The point of the IP address verification is just to protect against any future mistakes, or even certain forms of social engineering.\n\nI made an informed decision, knowing the full context, and being fully aware of exactly what the check does and doesn't protect against. It's pretty damn good at ensuring the request originated from the device + browser the token was created for, which is really good at protection in the event of cookie theft. That protection is pretty much gone once a user is using something like a public VPN or if they have bad security practices or whatever. But that puts the risk into a different area of concern for overall security. \n\nAnd I was just giving an example of how some cookie (here a JWT) being invalid isn't necessarily anything malicious. Maybe the user just disconnected from a corporate VPN or something. My point here is indisputably just valid. And who do you think you are to butt in and criticize my security practices when you know nothing of the requirements or context?",

Those issues would break so many other things that hardware and software (e.g. browser) developers go to Great lengths to prevent them now. We have ECC memory, error checking in TCP, SSL validation on https calls would fail to decrypt, etc. As an application developer, you really shouldn't have to code around those types of expectations for cookies. Abuse is definitely a possibility, but suppose you have another developer on your project that simply implement them wrong? My advice would be to design your app in such a way that it doesn't matter. They are simply present or not, valid or not. The script kitties and hackbots will take a poke at you in a hundred ways beyond just this. If you actually watch a live tale of an access log on a production website, you'd be shocked at the nonsense that goes on. As long as it's not a DDoS or other more orchestrated attack, it's just a nuisance. I wouldn't spend much time on it.\n\nI'm a big believer in being clear about the difference between practical and theoretical security. Lots of people like to talk about the latter and often mist details in the former. For instance, as another commenter or two mentioned, you are almost certainly not validating your cookies. Cookies are not signed and do not include mechanisms for validation. They are simply strings. You are almost certainly putting jwts in your cookies, in which case, good on you because that's a modern best practice as opposed to transmitting them other ways (assuming you're setting appropriate httpOnly/etc flags). But if you're going down that route, I would spend an hour looking at OWASP and other guidelines regarding JWT handling. Most major security vendors have fairly well written blog posts that you can Google. You will find recommendations in there on things like always explicitly setting your algorithms for both signing and validation. Those are the items I would personally be spending my time on.",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: Imagine that you were tasked with proposing a new, intuitive, term to replace the term** ***HTTP cookie.*** **What term(s) would you propose (& why)?**\n\nGiven that the term *HTTP cookie*, [which, according to Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Origin_of_the_name), got its name from the term *magic cookie*, is unintuitive (IMHO at least) - especially when compared with intuitive terms such as *local storage* and *session storage*, which serve similar technical purposes - what would you suggest as a more intuitive term to replace *HTTP cookie*? Why that/those term(s)? Please offer multiple terms if you have lots of ideas!\n\n(The main constraint/goal for the term is to balance describing its technical purpose and its memorableness/catchiness. On the aforementioned spectrum, *HTTP cookie* is arguably too far down the catchy end of the spectrum, so looking for something that tells its technical purpose more. Arguments for cookies intuitiveness are welcome as well.)\n\n**My (Biased) Favorites**: *the reason why*\n\n* **HTTP Passport**: *because it captures both the authentication (identification) and tracking purposes of modern cookies while being easy to remember.*\n* **HTTP Ticket Wallets**: *because of* [*the explanation*](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/s1vnxz/comment/hsbzele/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nEdit: included my favorite(s) & made an ask for a reason for your proposed term(s)\n\nEdit 2: another biased fav",

Perhaps instead of “cookies” in a “cookie jar” they’d be more like “tickets” in a “ticket wallet.” People are used to providing ticket numbers and tracking numbers and so on, so this could ease the mental model for non technical users as well.\n\nThere are a fair number of parallels. Tickets can expire and may only be valid where they were issued, or at any participating location. Ticket information isn’t something you’d want to share with strangers because they might pretend to be you to get access. Sometimes a ticket is uniquely identified, so that you get specific access (seats for a play // session ID), and other times it’s a generic placeholder to acknowledge that you generally get service (drink tickets // use dark site theme).\n\nFrom a consent and tracking perspective, you generally wouldn’t want a vendor to know all the other tickets you have from other vendors just because you got one ticket from this vendor. Nor would you necessarily want them to be able to track that you got a ticket from them on seven separate occasions. Or you might opt into all that if you think it’ll help you get better deal offers from them or something.\n\n“Shredding your tickets” is a pretty easy parallel to “assume I’m nobody and start over.”\n\nHTTP Ticket Wallets.",

The browser defines when the \"current session\" ends, and some browsers use session restoring when restarting. This can cause session cookies to last indefinitely.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd as has been posted here and on StackOverflow before if a client has their browser set to \"continue where you left off\", the client can close the window, and reopen without the browser deleting the http cookie.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIs this is legitimate concern? I presume that if the client closes the TAB with my website on it, then closes their browser, that would be a qualifying event for the browser to delete the cookie? What about if the user closes the tab but doesn't close the browser? Is there an elapsed time after which the browser chooses to delete the cookie?\n\nI do realize that none of this matters when it comes to adversarial users... im simply looking for peace of mind that under normal situations (and popular browsers), session expiring cookies dont last forever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, I am aware that the title is a bit of a mouthful, but Im trying to SEO it so that other users wont need to ask the same question.",

        "author": "HugeLetters",

        "selftext": "I would like to improve UX for authentication in my pet web app.\n\nJust to clarify about the title: I'm talking about storing session DATA, not session token. You CAN NOT use session data to authenticate your requests - requests are authenticated with a session token which is stored an http-only cookie. Session data is basically your userid, username, email and when your session expires. Right now it's just stored in-memory on the client.\n\nIs it okay to store such data in a cookie accessible in JS? That way I could: 1) redirect unauthorized users to signin page immediately by checking in my middleware that they dont have session data / it expired. 2) Authorized users will get page rendered faster since session data is already in the cookie - no need for another server roundtrip.\n\nThere is no security concern for impersonation or anything like that - if someone tries to set session data cookie manually, well then, all their API requests will be either unauthorized or at least authenticated with their actual data, not impersonated one.\n\nSo basically honest users will get a faster, more responsive experience and malicious actors won't be able to get access to any data they're not supposed to.\n\nSo the only concern I have - perhaps it's not ok to store user's email in a cookie accessible to JS, for example, that way chrome extension can get access to it. It's not a huge security concern but some people may not like that their email is in the open.\n\nSo is that okay or not?\n\nA step-by-step explanation if that makes it more clear.\n\nCurrently:\n\n1. Make a request for the page\n\n2. Server sends back HTML response\n\n3. Client renders pages, then makes a request to the server to get session data\n\n4. Client gets response with session data, stores in memory, uses it to render profile page\n\nWhat I would like to do:\n\n1. Make a request for the page\n\n2. Server sends back HTML response along with a cookie with session data\n\n3. Client renders pages, gets session data from cookie, uses it to render profile page",

Performance: Reading and writing data from the session/cookie is generally faster than a database operation.\n2. Simplicity: Easier to implement, doesn't require extra database management or setup.\n3. Server Resources: Lessens the load on your server, as it doesn't require server-side database interaction.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Size Limitations: Cookies particularly have storage limits. For large carts, this could be problematic.\n2. Persistence: If a user clears their cookies or changes the device/browser, the cart data will be lost.\n3. Security: Session data can be vulnerable if not handled properly. Also, cookies can be disabled by the user, which would break this functionality.\n\nStoring in a database:\n\nPros: \n\n1. Persistence: Cart data will be available across different devices and browsers. This is particularly useful if you have an authentication system and want to provide a seamless experience for logged-in users. \n2. Scalability: Databases are designed to handle large amounts of data, so you won't have issues with cart size. \n3. Advanced Features: Storing in a database allows for more complex features, such as storing cart history, analyzing user purchase behavior, etc.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Performance: Database operations can be slower than reading from session/cookie, and it may increase server load.\n2. Complexity: It requires more development work to design, implement, and manage a database solution.\n3. Cost: Depending on your infrastructure, maintaining a database might add to the costs.\n\nSo, which approach should you choose?\n\nIf you're building a simple e-commerce platform, and you don't expect users to build up large carts, then storing cart data in the session or cookies may be sufficient.\n\nHowever, if you're looking to provide a more advanced and seamless user experience across different devices/browsers, or if you anticipate users will have large carts, then a database solution would be better. It also opens up opportunities for more advanced features and analytics down the line.\n\nAlso, it's worth considering a hybrid approach, where you store cart data in both the session/cookie and the database. The session/cookie can provide a quick and responsive user experience, while the database ensures persistence and scalability. You could use the session/cookie as the primary storage and sync it to the database at regular intervals or at specific triggers (like at login/logout, or when the cart changes significantly).\"",

You can’t just throw `useEffect` everywhere like you used to in CRA.\n\nNow, for the cookie thing with “appConfig”—in my last project (lowkey a mess), I tried doing it with `useEffect` and fetching from the API, but it got ugly real quick. My components were flickering, the page took forever to load, and it was just bad UX. So yeah, don’t go down that road. \n\nInstead, you can set that cookie server-side using `next/headers`. Yeah, it’s annoying, but Next.js is all about pre-rendering stuff, and setting cookies server-side makes sure everything’s ready before the page even hits the client. You don’t want users staring at broken layouts while the config loads.\n\nBut if you just wanna hack it? Make an API route, throw your fetch in `useEffect`, and just set the cookie there.

(oh and it's all within family so if I screw up there's really no legal consequences which means it is alright that I might not be qualified for the job :D)  \n\n\nI've been reading about cookies because dad had a concern about the infamous cookie banner.

So we implemented a simple toast informing that we do not collect any cookies, and yes it shows up every time somebody reenters or refreshes the website.  \n\n\nNow for my question. Wiki says \\`Cookies are placed on the device used to access a website,\\`  \nMDN says that a cookie is something that server sends to the user. And I am really thinking here because:  \n\n\nI was thinking about implementing a simple analytics system (no need for advanced google shit) that would work on every button. Every button has an ID, and when it's clicked, I get a +1 in my database. Fully anonymous, no IPs, no locations, just a simple number increment. It might also count seconds to see which photos are being displayed.. I think you get the point. A primitive analytics that would help me figure out how to position things on the website, what's interesting and what isn't.  \n\n\nThere would be no tracking, no permanently keeping anything on user's PCs, no PII at all. Would something like this be considered a cookie? Would it need a legit cookie banner? Is it a fair solution?Am I thinking about it in a wrong way or doing something wrong?   \n\n\nAbove are few questions that come to my mind when trying to grasp this topic.

If you do not collect any user data and don't save any cookies you don't have anything to inform about, so just don't.\n\nAs for the rest of your question, any kind of tracking is still tracking and in general the user should be informed about that and allowed to opt-out. It gets murky if you don't collect any PII and stuff, it depends.\n\nHow are you going to \"count seconds\" when you don't know who the user is / can't \"connect\" their session together?

Geolocation data in cookies:\n\nI'm currently storing user geolocation data in a cookie. Here's a simplified version of what I'm doing in my middleware:\n\n`export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {`\n\n  `const response = NextResponse.next();`\n\n  `const { city, country } = geolocation(request);`\n\n  `const geo = { city, country };`\n\n  `response.cookies.set('userGeoData', JSON.stringify(geo), { httpOnly: false });`\n\n  `return response;`\n\n`}`\n\nThen, in my React components, I'm reading this cookie to access the geolocation data.\n\n\n\n2. Storing visitor email:\n\nWhen a visitor submits a form with their email (without being authenticated), I'm storing this email in a cookie for later use to pre-fill forms.\n\n\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is using cookies a good practice for storing geolocation data? Are there security or performance concerns I should be aware of?\n\n2. Are there better alternatives to cookies for handling geolocation data in a Next.js app?\n\n3. Is it okay to store a visitor's email in cookies when they're not authenticated? Are there any privacy or security issues with this approach?\n\n4. How would you handle these scenarios (geolocation and visitor email) in a Next.js app?\n\n\n\nI want to ensure I'm following best practices for data handling and user privacy. Any insights or alternative approaches would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "I'm building a web app with React, Redux and Django DRF. \n\nI find myself with a problem. If a user does not logout, just closes the browser, and then comes back to the site, the user remains authenticated, but the csrftoken is an empty string state in Redux. When App.jsx mounts, I want to check browser storage cookies, and if sessionid and csrftoken cookies are set, I want to set those in Redux state also. \n\nI tried using js-cookie and this is what happens:\n\n    import Cookies from 'js-cookie';\n    \n    const App = () => {\n    \n        const cookies = Cookies.get();\n        console.log(\"COOKIES FROM APP\", cookies);\n    \n        for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(cookies)) {\n            console.log(`Cookie: ${key} = ${value}`);\n        }\n    \n        return (\n            <Routes>\n                <Route path=\"/\" element={<Home />} />\n                <Route path=\"/login\" element={<Login />} />\n                <Route\n                    path=\"/dashboard\" \n                    element={<PrivateRoute><Dashboard /></PrivateRoute>} \n                />\n            </Routes>\n        )\n    \n    };\n    \n    export default App;\n    ----------------------------------------------\n    // console.log:\n    COOKIES FROM APP Object {  }\n\nWhile COOKIES FROM APP logs the Object, the following for loop does not iterate/does not log anything to console.\n\nI then thought maybe if I want it on component mount, I need useEffect:\n\n        useEffect(() => {\n            const cookies = Cookies.get();\n            console.log(\"COOKIES FROM APP\", cookies);\n    \n            for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(cookies)) {\n                console.log(`Cookie: ${key} = ${value}`);\n            }\n    \n            const csrfToken = Cookies.get('csrftoken');\n            console.log('CSRF Token From Cookies:', csrfToken);\n        }, []);\n\nBut it still only logs COOKIES FROM APP, and now also CSRF Token From Cookies: undefined.\n\nWhen my one of my components mounts, I dispatch a getSession call, which calls the backend, and returns isAuthenticated bool if there's a session, I then set isAuthenticated in Redux state. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure how to check for presence of CSRF token. If I dispatch fetchCSRFToken action, this will call the backend, and return a new CSRF token:\n\n    # Django views.py\n    \n    def get_csrf(request):\n        response = JsonResponse({'detail': 'CSRF cookie set'})\n        response['X-CSRFToken'] = get_token(request)\n        return response\n    \n    class SessionView(APIView):\n        authentication_classes = [SessionAuthentication, BasicAuthentication]\n        permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]\n    \n        @staticmethod\n        def get(request, format=None):\n            return JsonResponse({'isAuthenticated': True})\n\nIf I set the newly returned token in Redux state, then I end up with a different CSRF token in state, and different one set in browser storage cookies. \n\nHow can I check for presence of csrftoken set in browser storage cookies, so that I can set retrieve it and set it in Redux state?

If the user isn't logged in on twitter.com either then twitter.com just says \"nope.\" If the user is logged in on twitter.com, it responds with a payload (JWT or something similar) that gives a username and a one-off login token. The Twitter server also registered that token with X so that when the browser then makes its next request to X with the new token, X can say, \"Yep, you're logged in.\"\n\nThere are people here saying they have set `SameSite=none` on their login cookies. If so, that's incredibly stupid as it will allow any site to steal your Twitter and X account. I don't have a Twitter login handy to check if this is how they've done it or not, but it's not necessary to make this work; the \"lax\" setting is intended for this sort of use.",

        "author": "New_Dragonfly9732",
        "id": "1fd3ts8",
        "selftext": "### What I have understood (I guess):\n\n1. **Cross-origin Cookies**:  \n   Cookies set with `Domain=\"example.com\"` are not sent with `fetch` requests from origins like `hello.example2.com` to `mywebsite.example.com` because they are different domains. However, I am aware there might be a malicious workaround for this via `<form>`(point 3).\n\n2. **Fetch Requests and `SameSite` Behavior**:  \n   With `SameSite=\"Strict\"`, cookies set with `Domain=\"example.com\"` are included in `fetch` requests from subdomains like `frontend.example.com`, but not from unrelated domains like `hello.test.example.com`. With `SameSite=\"None\"`, cookies should be sent even from different subdomains if they belong to the same domain.\n\n3. **Form Submissions and Cookies**:  \n   Form submissions from different domains, like `hello.example2.com`, include cookies when `SameSite=\"None\"`, but not when `SameSite=\"Strict\"`. HTML forms bypass CORS restrictions since they directly open the target URL.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Questions:\n\n1. **How do companies like Google and Amazon manage to track users across multiple external domains?**  \n   Given that EVEN if Google set their cookies with `SameSite=None`, the requests made by `fetch` from a website.com (which uses google adsense and has a google.com/trackme url) cannot include the Google cookie since it's another domain, how do these companies effectively use cookies to track users across various external domains and websites?\n\n2. **Why does setting `domain: \"frontend.example.com\"` cause the cookie not to be set properly?**  \n   When I put in my backend the setting `domain: \"frontend.example.com\"` for a cookie to be used specifically by the frontend website, the cookie is not set in frontend as expected and the frontend stops working. How can I ensure that `frontend.example.com` can use the cookie while preventing `test3.example.com` from accessing it? What should I configure to achieve this?",

I went to settings -> 3rd party cookies -> “block 3rd party cookies”\n\nMy site still works , even though it depends on a 3rd party cookie 😆.  I also see the 3rd party cookie being created.   Maybe evils in the details of whether my cookie actually is 3rd party or not… but chrome warns about it being a 3rd party.  \n\nIt’s probably an edge case where “samesite” is “NONE” so it’s a 3rd party cookie , BUT it’s also used on the same domain ( my site ).  Therefore even though it’s a 3rd party cookie it won’t be blocked in creation or usage when it’s used in 1st party context. \n\nAnyone more familiar with this crazy world, please chime in.  Thank you, thank you. ",

Back to the internet: we eventually started blocking these ads because they suck and we could, but we did so without thinking of the affect it had on the creators of the content we actually wanted. Those creators then have to either get more aggressive ads to make up the difference (or find other streams like newsletters and offers).

You see this guy asking for a small donation to cover the cost of work he has done and hosted and tons of others have consumed based on the traffic to his site, but you use words like \"begging\" and say he has the \"audacity\" to ask for a donation for support, strengthening the argument that people generally have a strong aversion to donating for things like this. Maybe you're implying that because it's based on a copyrighted work and his original monetization plan fell through, he should eat the costs entirely, but wouldn't that apply to any content creator that leverages other work, such as reviewers, streamers, or youtubers that do lets plays, critics, etc.?\n\nThousands of people have visited his site looking for content like this. I also get why they are not willing to pay for it - it's not life changing to see or read this stuff, but they get value out of it, even if they wouldn't go out and buy a book of the relationships between dark characters.\n\nYou are telling me that the link I provided is a terrible example of my point. If you aren't convinced from the above, it doesn't really matter - because the key question is - how can these content creators monetize and get paid to at least break even, if not profit off their work?\n\nEDIT: I should state for the record, I also \\*hate\\* ads. This is why they're not on my app. I spent a lot of time and effort designing a clean aesthetic and I don't want to pollute it with ads. However, I also know that there is a limit to how much I am willing to spend out of pocket to provide a service for others, and at some point, if I can't find another way to monetize, I'll have little choice - take my app down, or introduce ads.

The real root cause is the culture, IMO. Edge/Chrome/Firefox/Android's default browser/Safari/etc don't come with an easy already-set-up way to deliver money to the people whose services you use, so websites either have to use ads or literally block the passage toward their content by forcing people to go set up an alternate funding method.\n\nIMO OSes should have some sort of wallet/funding service built-in.

The original page rank algorithm was manipulated and gamed by web sites in a manner that led to the erosion of its effectiveness. \nWe need a way to establish trust on the web, especially trust in information sources and individuals.

I have been messing around with a personal project using vanilla js, flask, and supabase and have been super confused about how client-side and server-side authentication are supposed to work in tandem, which is more of a big picture security question, maybe. (I've looked all over SO, reddit, and chatgpt and can't seem to find a straight forward answer). Please let me know where I've gone wrong. This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17shju0/are_cookies_really_safer_than_localsession_storage/) didn't really help me, and my networking knowledge is weak in general.\n\nSay I've logged a user in and have an access token on the server side from my request to supabase, which authenticated the email/pw creds. The login response (to the client's login request) should set the browser's cookies which include this access token (as a JWT, for example).  I don't think it should matter that the DBS is supabase in this case, as access tokens have to come from somewhere. \n\nNow, say the user wants to see some data that is private to them. The browser sends a request for this data with cookies by default, which the server can read and authenticate, and can be set to time out or only survive the life of the window in the browser, etc. \n\n  \nThis does not seem secure at all. Cookies are not inherently secure, and packet sniffing makes any browser-hiding of information irrelevant. JWTs are not really encrypted, just signed (I think?). How can my server actually distinguish between legitimate requests from the original browser session that originally logged in and someone sniffing packets between the server and browser that could use the access token found in those cookies to make malicious requests? \n\n\n\n",

                "body": "The question you're asking is spot on, and a good one. Kudos to you for thinking about security when just starting out, most don't care about security until there's been a breach of some kind. If you want to know more about the specific attack vector you're describing with the packet sniffing, it's called a combination of a [Man in the Middle Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) and [Session Hijacking](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/session-hijacking/#:~:text=Session%20hijacking%20refers%20to%20the,to%20ensure%20continuity%20and%20security). \n\nNow, I don't know much exactly what you're specific configuration is, but there are two pieces to this puzzle that help keep all of this secure so that the middleware won't be able to sniff packets, but there is one crucial assumption that has to be addressed first. That assumption is that the client and server are not directly compromised, for if the attacker has direct access to either the client or server, all bets are off when talking about network communication security.\n\nFirst is the utilization of HTTP over SSL/TLS (HTTPS) is the first counter measure to this. If you want to go in depth learning about the TLS handshake between the client and server, or understanding exactly what and how the transmitted packets are encrypted, there are tons of resources on line. But in essence this makes sure when transmitted, all information is end-to-end encrypted, meaning the middle man can not sniff any of the headers out of the requests which would compromise the client.\n\nSecond is the usage of secure cookies, which when boiled down to it, is a flag that the browser respects to ensure the cookie will only ever be transmitted over secure channels. So this means that if the client software were to accidentally try to make a request over HTTP instead of HTTPS (maybe even due a cross site scripting attack) the browser would not include the cookies in the request that are marked with the secure flag. So this is an added safeguard on top of using HTTPS to ensure the important cookies will not be transmitted via insecure means.\n\nI know this is a lot, but I hope it helps to fill in some of the gaps that you had after your original post you linked.",

Help me out.\n\nI'm currently trying to learn how to implement session authentication with vanilla JS to be used on the client's browser. (Best to start from the basics, right?)\n\nFrom my limited understanding, you can set the 'httponly' flag in the header of a response on the server side. Supposedly, this flag disallows most browsers to read the cookie mitigating XSS attacks. Great. That's great.\n\nBut if the client's browser cannot access this httponly cookie, how do you use this cookie in the header of subsequent responses to authenticate a user session? Can you even use httponly cookies for user sessions?\n\nIf not, then what is the point of an httponly cookie?\n\nI must be missing something obvious here.\n\n----\n\n\n\nedit: Thank you all for the responses!\n\nIf anyone has other authentication/XSS/CSRF prevention methods for a junior dev please leave them here!

That’s why it’s safer.\n\nThe cookie is however still sent back to your server with every request so you still have access to its contents server side. Using https also adds an additional layer of protection against man in the middle attacks. \n\nYou should also make sure that the domain for the cookie is properly set and restricted to just your domain.",

It's more \"only make auth credentials available where they are actually required\".\n\nThe client (usually) doesn't have any reason to access a cookie, so why allow it? It's not so much that the client can't be trusted, it's more that there's no reason to trust it. \"Trust no-one\" is a standard security best practice.\n\n> But if the client's browser cannot access this httponly cookie\n\nThe browser can access cookies, but generally browsers don't do anything except blindly send them to the server (and delete them when they expire). It's _javascript_ that can't access httponly cookies.\n\n> how do you use this cookie in the header of subsequent responses to authenticate a user session\n\nCookies are sent in all future network requests. That's how cookies work.\n\nIn a very simple implementation, the user enters their username/password, and it'll be sent to the server. The server checks the username/password, then if they're valid it generates random string (I'd personally use a \"Version 4\" UUID) and creates a file on the disk or in a database with that UUID as the filename/database id. In the file or database row, the server records the username and some kind of proof that the user previously provided a valid password (do _not_ store the password as proof, but do derive the proof from the password so that this will be invalidated if the password is reset).\n\nThen on future requests, the server simply reads that file / db record, re-validates the proof of the password, and it then trusts the HTTP request (which might be a javascript API call - or an image - or anything - it doesn't have to be a full page load).",

A password is pretty good proof.\n\nThat includes a 16 year old kid logging onto dad's phone and ordering a Playstation on Amazon. Amazon is required to refund the purchase whenever that happens, and they can't necessarily force the customer to send the Playstation back either. It was an unauthorised payment, and that's Amazon's fault. If Amazon wants the product returned they might need to involve the police, and possibly even take it to a court case. Cheaper to just let them keep the Playstation (after asking nicely for them to please return it).\n\nThe only other recourse Amazon has is to ban the customer's account.\n\nOh, and if refunds happen too often, Visa/Mastercard won't let you charge anyone's credit card. That would be bad.\n\nIf it was me, I'd only require a transaction for large purchases or if something is suspicious, like an IP address from an unexpected location.",

Even if it’s a day (Fri/Mon are great for a 3-day weekend), I’ve found it’s a nice little recharge. If you’re severely burnt out, maybe take a few days off instead.\n- Try to make sure you’re taking care of yourself outside of work. Eat plenty of fiber, protein, and non-processed food. Drink enough water. Do some light exercise to get your body moving and the dopamine flowing. Most importantly, _try to get enough sleep!_ I’ve found that the lack of this has often been a huge drag on my motivation and attitude. Often times, I’m not actually burnt out, I’m just not well-rested enough to face the day-to-day stress of web development.\n- If you’re working on a large or complex feature/task, try to keep an optional, low-effort task (or collection of tasks) available to yourself. Sometimes just switching gears to something less complex can help re-up your motivation.\n- When you’re done with work for the day, try to engage in hobbies that don’t involve screens or sitting at your work area. Go for a short walk if you can/if your environment permits it. Check out a local coffee shop or gift shop. Make sure you’re getting some social time in (if you’re into that) so your mind can get off the topic of work.\n\nThese are just a few things that have worked for me. I understand that it’s hard to find the motivation to do some of the things on this list when you’re in the depths of burnout, so I encourage you to take it one habit/activity at a time so you don’t get further burnt out.

For me these are little things - not eating a sandwich or drinking coffee but really trying to feel it's taste, try some new flavours with it, see if it's better or not. Taking a bite of protein bar with chocolate and just letting it melt. Not just feeding my nicotine addiction but admiring the chaos of smoke on my cig break.

Silly things like that probably took me through the thick of seriously shitty time, pretty much like you've described in your original post.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is... There's this fantasy claim that our brain is a separate entity from our mind. True or not, try feeding it with something other than work to make it calm.

Don't take on more work than you can do while maintaining a healthy work/life balance. No one else knows what your limits are, you can't expect them to maintain it for you. You'll have to say no sometimes, or just silently do less and see if anybody complains. You might be surprised. But if they are shitty about it then you need a new job.\n\nGranted it's pretty hard to know your limits when you're new to the industry, most people learn it by burning out. It's not permanent though.",

The first code chunk is for setting up the cookie. when a user logs in, a session cookie is created, a good json response is sent back to the form in my html page, and then the html page redirects to an api endpoint that renders an ejs page. the second code chunk is the login endpoint. Again, it works on Chrome, but not Edge, Arc, or Safari, so I'm thinking it's something to do with the cookie.

        "selftext": "Please correct me if I am wrong! \n\nDecoupling is how most applications are built—separating the client from the backend. This approach works well because it separates concerns. \n\nWhen authenticating users, access tokens are used to validate requests and process them in the backend. Many tutorials suggest storing access tokens in `localStorage`, which seems convenient. However, further research reveals that this approach is prone to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. \n\nSo, what is the solution? \n\nHTTP-only cookies! With HTTP-only cookies, JavaScript cannot access the token, and it is sent to the server with every request. **Isn’t that great?** Well, it’s an improvement, but now we encounter the problem of CSRF. Fortunately, this can be mitigated using the `SameSite` attribute. So, is this a good solution? Yes.\n\nNow, my question relates to the phase-out of third-party cookies in the Chrome browser. I keep encountering an error message: *‘Third-party cookie will be blocked.’* Will all websites that rely on saving HTTP-only cookies be affected once the phase-out begins, especially for applications with React apps on different domains",

I do this using Supabase, where I use their infrastructure to have my users login, but I save the cookies myself in the cookies: \"user-0\" and \"user-1\".

The main issue now is that I am using a slug for after /u (So, /u/\\[slug\\]), which can be very inconsistent when working for client components. Client components only work when they mount, but this is problematic as the client component might fall back to user 0 instead of actually using the right slug. I am getting the slug and then setting it inside of my Zustand state.\n\n  \nIs there a better way of doing the slug part? I was even thinking of using cookies, but I feel like there should be a more intuitive way of doing this?\n\n      const access_token = getClientToken(params.id as string);\n\n    export const getClientToken = (id: string) => {\n      if (typeof document === \"undefined\") return;\n      const cookies = parse(document.cookie)[`user-${id}`];\n    \n      return JSON.parse(cookies)[0];\n    };\n    \n    \n\n  \n",

There's also a slim chance that the user has disabled browser storage.\n\nAlso, if you use `SameSite: lax` the cookie can be sent to the server on page load so you know who the authenticated user is when rendering your app.",

                "body": "I'd like to point out that the \"Cookie\" in cookie warnings is not actually cookies. That's one of the biggest misconceptions and misnomers that has caused so many of the problems we currently see with lack of compliance. \"Cookies\" in this case refers to any automatic collection (and further storage, processing, etc) of data. Back when the \"Cookie law\" got it's shorthand name, Cookies just happened to be the most worrisome example of the process.\n\nA lot of American tech people have taken the cookie warnings to mean that they need the users permission to store data on the users computer (i.e. a cookie). That's actually the opposite of the reality -- they only need the users permission if they are going to collect data and use it for a purpose other than the one that would be obvious to the user. An IP address is a great example, because I obviously need a return address in order to send you a response to your request -- however the fact that I needed it for the one purpose doesn't give me the right to use it for any other purpose (like looking up what region you're connecting from) without your explicit consent and awareness that I'm going to do that. Cookies are out of date -- they're still used, but they are by far not the main way that data is collected or processed, so calling a requirement to get the Users consent to collect data for analytics a \"Cookie Consent\" is just misleading. \n\nThe second biggest misunderstanding in my opinion is Americans misinterpretation of \"Personal Information\" as PII. In the States, PII refers to individual identifiers -- as in the identifier is an individual piece of information. In Europe, the GDPR simply refers to Personal Information as any information about a person -- like your eye color. That information doesn't have to be able to identify you, but it's about you, so it's YOUR information (as in there's a sense of ownership and since the information is about you, you own that information and you get to choose what other people are allowed to do with it). It starts to get confusing when the law defines it as any information, that when combined with other information, can be used to identify a unique individual. That starts to sounds like PII, but that's just side effect of the fact that it's personal, and this is why legally, there's pretty much no such thing as Anonymous data. If you have some data about a person, and you remove the \"personal identifier\", it's still that persons personal data. All you've actually done is remove your ability to correct it or delete it if that person asks you to. Unless you can prove that that data could plausibly belong to 10 or more people, you haven't legally \"anonymized\" it. \n\nMy favorite example of the Anti Cookie Consent popup is Reuters -- it starts with the title \"Right to Withdraw Consent under GDPR\" -- imagine you skipped the fine print and went straight to the two button options \"Accept All\" (highlighted) or \"Show Purposes\" -- Why yes! I would absolutely like to Accept ALL of my Rights to Withdraw Consent! Oh, but wait, that's not what they meant... If you actually go through the effort of reading the two paragraphs of fine print (not clicking on any of the links), they aren't written in intelligible English. I don't mean it's just confusing, wrong or misleading (all of which it is), I mean it actually doesn't make any coherent sense. It's like when you go back and fix a sentence you've already written but forget to proofread it after you make your changes and consequently have a sentence that isn't grammatically meaningful.",

        "selftext": "I'm currently building a website with Next.js (ex: www.example.com) and an ASP.NET Core Web API (api.example.com). I had a few basic requirements:\n1. Authentication logic should be in the backend only, not touching Next.js. Zero-trust.\n2. Next.js is able to authenticate to make requests for server-rendered pages to the API, but ONLY using the client's credentials.\n3. Client is also aware of its login state for client-side render changes.\n4. User doesn't need to log in frequently, so a refresh token is required.\n5. Session management is stateless as far as the API is concerned (achievable using JWTs).\n\nI thought for a while on the best way to handle this; I read that HTTP-only cookies are considered the best from a security perspective for XSS protection. So, I settled on using HTTP-only cookies. A user would log in, and 2 cookies would be set by the API: an access token, scoped to both the site and the API (since they share a domain, that way Next.js can read that cookie and make authenticated calls if needed), and a refresh token, scoped to only the authentication endpoints (to reduce exposure). The login request would return a JSON containing the expiration times, so the browser can know its token statuses to refresh and redirect back to login.\n\nNow, I've actually tried to start implementing it, and it seems that from the tutorials I'm seeing that using a JWT in cookies is pretty rare (or just using cookies in general for a backend API). It seems like using an \"Authorization: Bearer\" header is strongly preferred. Is what I'm doing considering an antipattern? If local storage isn't considered secure enough to store my refresh token, what other options do I really have for maintaining login between sessions? ",

Apis that you can use in frontend are always visible and accessible,  you can use login-required middleware, CORS and ratelimiting to make sure no one can misuse or overuse it.

Not to mention the fact that not all devices will have an actual GPS, and instead default to IP or Google WiFi location. The latter of which is pretty damn accurate, but scammers probably won't enable location.\n\nTracing by IP address doesn't need the browser location access, though. You can easily built this into your backend, as it's tied to the request. It's very common to see IP ranges blacklisted on firewalls, such as botnets and known malicious sources. There's just 2 caveats here.\n\n1. IP's aren't always reliable, the location you get from IP tracing is based on the ISP that owns it. Which is usually tied to the correct country, but it doesn't have to be. VPNS will also easily circumvent this.\n\n2. IP addresses are considered personal data under GDPR. So you will need to request explicit consent in something like a cookie bar. But you'll need to actually reference the GDPR guidelines on this. \n\nYou should be able to block entire IP ranges, though. As you're not tying them to individual data. This is basically how a lot of US websites block out all of the EU at the moment. \n\nNote: I'm not a legal expert, I only have some basic knowledge on GDPR based on what I had to implement.",

But, yes, if their IP switches it's gone. Not to mention the fact that some ISPs give the same IP to multiple households.  \n\nThere's also browser fingerprinting to look into, but browsers also have built-in tools to mitigate those. It's just a tricky situation. The privacy focused mindset of today makes it so there's plenty of tools to make it hard to verify people based on any form of data.\n\nBy the way, GDPR doesn't ban tracking, you just need to provide the user with a clear document stating what data you're collecting, and why you're collecting it. There's nothing stopping you from disallowing users from operating on the platform if they do not opt in to certain data collection, such as location. But there's also nothing stopping a bad actor from spoofing their IP and location.",

It also has a backend server that compile and serve the frontend html/JavaScript files.\n\nSo, by running an API proxy like this, how it works under-the-hood is:\n\n\\- Browser (with [frontend.com](https://frontend.com) domain) calls the [frontend.com](https://frontend.com)'s backend server;\n\n\\- [frontend.com](https://frontend.com)'s backend server receives a call from the browser (with [frontend.com](https://frontend.com) as the caller, therefore no cross-domain), it will find the mapped backend's domain, and forward the call to [backend.com](https://backend.com);\n\n\\- [backend.com](https://backend.com)'s backend server then receive a call from the [frontend.com](https://frontend.com)'s backend server. Since it is a server-to-server call, domain policy is bypassed (not directly related to your cookie issue, but it is commonly used for solving CORS policy problem).",

The code for setting the cookie on the server side is identical for both HEAD and POST requests.\n3. There are no apparent errors or exceptions on the server side, and the server responds with a 200 status code.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the relevant server-side code:\n\n    exports.testCookie = async (req, res) => {\n       try {\n         const serialized = serialize('cookie', 'test-cookie', {\n           httpOnly: true,\n           maxAge: 120000000,\n           path: '/',\n           sameSite: 'Lax',\n         });     \n    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', serialized)\n         res.status(200)\n       } catch (error) {\n         console.error(\"Error creating user:\", error);\n         res.status(500).json({error: \"Internal server error\"});\n       }\n     }; \n\nI'm puzzled by this behavior, as I would expect the browser to set the cookie as it does with HEAD requests.

Is there something I should check or configure differently on the client side to ensure the cookie is set correctly?",

        "selftext": " I am currently working on the development of a Central Authentication Service (CAS) with the aim of streamlining user management and authentication processes across all of my projects. The primary objective is to eliminate the need for separate user management systems and authentication protocols for each individual project.\n\nThe CAS operates on a cookie-based mechanism, where users, upon signing in, receive a domain-wide usable cookie. This cookie serves as a means of authorization for other services, allowing them to authenticate the user without the need for redundant login processes.\n\nDuring my research, I came across various articles and forums emphasizing the importance of setting short Time-to-Live (TTL) values for session cookies to mitigate the risk of cookie hijacking attacks. However, my system takes a different approach by incrementing the TTL on the server side, rather than refreshing the cookie at regular intervals. I am currently grappling with understanding the practical utility of this method, as it seems that once an attacker obtains the original cookie, they could potentially perpetually acquire refreshed cookies from the server, making be unsure about the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing security.",

I get many informal requests and it's hard to let go a potential business opportunity in this economy so I had my guard down.  \n  \nI will share some of the red flags I encountered so people can avoid this.  \n1. The profile was very generic and not much info about the company or the project was given just that they \"needed someone who knows web3\"\n\n  \n2. They used a clone of a legitimate business to fool me into thinking it was something real - perhaps made by AI or using AI to make it look legit.\n\n3. They hid the actual malware in an endpoint so it wasn't really included in the project however buried deep in the code there was an eval function that did the trick and because it ran in NodeJS it had access to the computer. This is the EP but they will probably erase it soon [https://api.npoint.io/4a13a331833944337cb1](https://api.npoint.io/4a13a331833944337cb1)  \n  \n4. I analyzed the code with AI and though it looks like it might work in some cases I think the inherent security of most wallet software such as encryption would not let them actually steal my keys easily however if there is a weak or leaked password they could potentially decrypt it.\n\nSteps I took and tips to be more secure:\n\n1. Always ask for more info, scammers usually have limited time to write and make it more complex so they would ignore you if you started asking way too much information.\n\n2. Never ever give your phone number on LinkedIn, they could get it after some initial calls - but giving it to them right away or including in on your Resumé could open the door to phishing attempts.\n\n3. Ask them for THEIR email - if it is a legitimate business they should have it with the company's domain name at least and it shouldn't be like [4b7t8347t@gmail.com](mailto:4b7t8347t@gmail.com) \n\n4. Goas without saying but never ever execute any shared code on your computer, if this is some sort of coding challenge it's best to use an online service or temporary server or a VM. Even innocent looking code can have a coplex Trojan such as the ones mentioned here.",

I have created the game itself, but I am running into some back-end issues, probably because I am not doing everything the correct way. Currently the game works, but if you spam too fast, the cookie count will go back down. \n\nThis is what the project looks like when updating cookie:\n\n\\- HTML + CSS displays the cookie and allows you to click on it, which activates a function in javascript\n\n\\- a javascript function receives the click event and sends a request to a route \\`\\`\\`/add\\_cookie\\`\\`\\`\n\n\\- in my Flask backend the route adds a cookie to \\`\\`\\`current\\_user\\`\\`\\` from flask\\_login and commits change to database. Then a value of \"cookie added\" is returned\n\n\\- Then there is a javascript ajax function that repeats itself every 100 miliseconds, that gets cookie amount from route \\`\\`\\`/get\\_cookies\\`\\`\\`, that returns the amount of cookies a player has.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some screenshots of the code:\n\n https://snipboard.io/uo5FO8.jpg  - addCookie and updateCookieCount functions\n\n https://snipboard.io/9lDGxw.jpg - add\\_cookie and get\\_cookie routes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would appreciate any help in making his code either more effective or steps on how to remake the game so that I don't overload the server with only a few players.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsome extra screenshots:\n\nadd\\_upgrade route -  https://snipboard.io/IY3ZiM.jpg \n\nbuy\\_upgrade route -  https://snipboard.io/NdHySE.jpg \n\nbuy\\_upgrade javascript -  https://snipboard.io/l97L2d.jpg \n\nthe game itself :D -  https://snipboard.io/lzNXWk.jpg \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n&#x200B;",

                "body": "It’s probably because of race conditions due to the rapid speed you’re clicking. One solution is to queue your requests in the front-end: instead of firing a request instantly upon every click, you can keep a local counter on the frontend. Then, every few seconds or so, you can send the total number of clicks made in that duration to the backend in a single request. If the total is 0 for the last few seconds just don’t send any request. The conditional logic for this should be pretty straightforward.\n\nSome other feedback: \n\n1 — jQuery.. not that this really matters all that much for a starter project, but jQuery is pretty much OBE at this point. You can replace everything you’re doing with jQuery with native JavaScript.\n\nHere’s a quick refactor example using native JS, no jQuery:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n    function updateCookieCount() {\n        fetch('/get_cookies')\n            .then(response => response.text())\n            .then(data => {\n                document.getElementById('cookiesCount').innerHTML = data;\n            })\n            .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n    }\n\n    function addCookie() {\n        fetch('/add_cookie/', {\n            method: 'POST'\n        })\n        .then(() => {\n            let countElem = document.getElementById('cookiesCount');\n            countElem.innerHTML = Number(countElem.innerHTML) + 1;\n        })\n        .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n    }\n\n    updateCookieCount();\n    setInterval(updateCookieCount, 100);\n});\n```\n\n2 — 100ms is pretty aggressive, you could probably drop that to 500ms with little loss in user experience. This will lighten the load on your server too.",

I think I am missing something where when I make the fetch from my Login Route from the ui to localhost:4000/auth/login because my UI is SSR the SSR server is making the request and not getting the set-cookie header and passing it through to the UI.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is some code with whats going on.\n\nHere is the response.headers from the fetch call\n\n    HeadersList {\n      cookies: [\n        'session_id=e8a09f09-780c-4f68-a377-6f994502c9a2; Path=/; Domain=localhost; Max-Age=86400; HttpOnly; SameSite=None'\n      ],\n      [Symbol(headers map)]: Map(9) {\n        'access-control-allow-credentials' => { name: 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', value: 'true' },\n        'access-control-allow-headers' => { name: 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers', value: 'Content-Type' },\n        'access-control-allow-methods' => {\n          name: 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods',\n          value: 'GET, POST, OPTIONS'\n        },\n        'access-control-allow-origin' => {\n          name: 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin',\n          value: 'http://localhost:4321'\n        },\n        'content-type' => { name: 'Content-Type', value: 'application/json' },\n        'set-cookie' => {\n          name: 'Set-Cookie',\n          value: 'session_id=e8a09f09-780c-4f68-a377-6f994502c9a2; Path=/; Domain=localhost; Max-Age=86400; HttpOnly; SameSite=None'\n        },\n        'vary' => { name: 'Vary', value: 'Origin, Access-Control-Request-Method' },\n        'date' => { name: 'Date', value: 'Tue, 14 Nov 2023 14:46:50 GMT' },\n        'content-length' => { name: 'Content-Length', value: '278' }\n      },\n      [Symbol(headers map sorted)]: null\n    }\n    HeadersList {\n      cookies: [\n        'session_id=032399d8-eb2b-4238-b78b-8c763e16202a; Path=/; Domain=localhost; Max-Age=86400; HttpOnly'\n      ],\n      [Symbol(headers map)]: Map(9) {\n        'access-control-allow-credentials' => { name: 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', value: 'true' },\n        'access-control-allow-headers' => { name: 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers', value: 'Content-Type' },\n        'access-control-allow-methods' => {\n          name: 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods',\n          value: 'GET, POST, OPTIONS'\n        },\n        'access-control-allow-origin' => {\n          name: 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin',\n          value: 'http://localhost:4321'\n        },\n        'content-type' => { name: 'Content-Type', value: 'application/json' },\n        'set-cookie' => {\n          name: 'Set-Cookie',\n          value: 'session_id=032399d8-eb2b-4238-b78b-8c763e16202a; Path=/; Domain=localhost; Max-Age=86400; HttpOnly'\n        },\n        'vary' => { name: 'Vary', value: 'Origin, Access-Control-Request-Method' },\n        'date' => { name: 'Date', value: 'Tue, 14 Nov 2023 14:49:34 GMT' },\n        'content-length' => { name: 'Content-Length', value: '278' }\n      },\n      [Symbol(headers map sorted)]: null\n    }\n\nAs you can see the server is properly sending back a set-cookie header.

And you should add  other toggles for any other scripts that you might be using that use cookies. The site has lots of examples.\n\nYou need to allow opt-out of those also I think. To say \"you are tracked\" alone is not enough. The library helps you do that.\n\nYour not allowed pre-made decisions, it has to be an active choice. And they have to be able to change it in future not just on first entry. Obviously this means you're gonna have reduced visibility in google analytics sadly (that's why there's all these \"gdpr compliant\" or cookieless analytics solutions, but i respect you've made that decision).\n\nOf course, many sites ignore these rules in reality and get away with it. But the library makes it a billion times easier to comply if configured correctly.\n\nYou can limit the impact by having something server side that only loads the cookie consent scripts if the user is coming from a EU IP. But that would be custom since the open source libraries only have the front end component which isn't enough to give that functionality out of the box. There are loads of other cookie consent services that do this for you also but they are all paid. Google \"cookie consent service\".\n\n\"Essential cookies\" for your site to even run are excluded from all this.",

It adjusts how GA collects data based on the user's consent status. So when users decline tracking, it limits data collection to anonymized data ensuring you're staying within legal requirements.\n\n  \nI'm Ben from StatsPro, a privacy-friendly analytics alternative to GA.

        "selftext": "Quick context: Using Vue for a frontend. Was setting up my state flows, and noticed an odd behaviour, in regard to sending cookies with requests.\n\nI've got a custom axios instance I'm using, which has some defaults, and an interceptor to add in the csrf token into the header, if it's available. I'm importing this instance, when making requests.\n\nWhere I set the defaults is like so:\n\n    const customAxios = axios.create({\n        baseURL: appConfig.BASE,\n        withCredentials: true })\n\nI've got a module where I have all the bare endpoint call functions. For example:\n\n    export const userTrainingData = async () => {\n        return await customAxios.get(config.BASE_AUTH_TRAININGDATA, { withCredentials: true }) }\n\n\nSo, here's the thing. If I have `withCredentials` set to `true` globally (as in, on the instance), and comment it out on the individual function, as expected, all available cookies (in this case sessionid and csrftoken) are sent (tested in the browser) with the request.\n\nIf I comment it out on the instance, and set it to `true` in the individual function, then just the csrftoken cookie is sent with the request, but no sessionid cookie. I've tried this multiple times, on different browsers, and it's the same. I've checked the headers, and they are all what they need to be (access control flags, origin, all of it). Everything else works as expected, it's just in where I mention `withCredentials` that's doing this.\n\nSo, is this normal behaviour? And if so, why? And if not, what could be causing this? It's driving me insane!",

Check this pen, I merely copy/pasted two icons and made them 2x size. They overlap without a specific reason:\n\nhttps://codepen.io/LuBre/pen/xxGdYqR\n\nWhile it's a stylish solution I think SVG's are still a better solution in most scenarios.",

So the site is still easy to use on ridiculously wide monitors? \n\n\\- The leading property management companies logos are all too small. \n\n\\- I think you should consider placing the company logos or the testimonials further to the top, so the user won't have to scroll too far down to see them. My favorite landing page is https://ahrefs.com/. They have have customer logos above the fold. \n\nHope this helps 🙂",

The actual European legal text is:\n\n> the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information\n\nSo it is the *storing and accessing* of information that triggers consent requirements, not the use of cookies in particular. Other rules around the globe, such as those in California, employ similarly broad language.\n\n(A minor side note, but cookie law is called EPD, not GDPR as many seem to believe. Gdpr is a separate somewhat related regulation that came later).\n\nThe more nuanced answer is that it depends what the pixel actually does. If it merely counts page views numerically, my understanding is that does not trigger any consent requirements. It is technically possible to create analytics that sufficiently avoid collecting user information as to not require consent, but almost no one does this, so in practice effectively all tracking pixels trigger consent requirements.\n\nFurther reading: https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2023/11/20/edpb-publishes-guidelines-to-clarify-scope-of-eu-cookie-notice-and-consent-requirements/",

I then hide the input field with CSS (display:none). \nIf this is set, I will also just show success and not store the data.\n\nWhile this likely cuts down on some of the spam, it is not nearly enough.\nNow that I think of it, I do not count how many requests I discard based on this honeyput - I probably should gather stats on that..\n\n\nYour cookie idea is interesting!\n\nWould you mind elaborating a bit on how you actually do this?\n\n1: Do you set the cookie on the page that contains the form?\n\n2: Cookie set server-side or with javascript?\n (my sites are completely static, so I cannot set server side cookies easily, however, I might be able to put something in apache that sets a cookie on a specific path)\n\n3: So do you just measure the timestamp on the server with what is in the cookie. And if it is, say, less than a second, you discard the request?\n\n4: What is a reasonable time difference needed for you not to discard?\n\n\n\nI have actually played a bit with a similar idea. What I do is I put a form element \n\n    <input type=\"hidden\" id=\"timestamp\" name=\"timestamp\">\n\nI then have some javascript set the timestamp value to current time.\n\nI then check on the server side on the server that processes the requests what the time difference is between the timestamps. My idea was that if the time difference was less than 1-2 seconds, then a human could not have filled the form. And if the time difference was too great (more than 24h) then it would probably be some bot that just uses  are stored set of values. Also, if the value was not set I would discard it.\n\nI have not ended up using this, however, because I lost actual real requests from at least one customer who uses NoScript extension.\nAnd also, I use a different server to process requests than the one serving the static sites. So even though I use NTP to sync time, there would sometimes be drift that caused those servers not to have sufficiently sync'ed up clocks to be reliable...",

If the image is not a perfect square in your case then the longer side of the rectangle will have to expand beyond 100% to compensate. \n\nAssuming you want this effect of the image filling up the entire 200x200px area it would be best to crop your images square before uploading. Otherwise if it's a rectangle then one side will always need to expand beyond 100% width of the container and the image will be cut off like you're seeing. \n\nI can't tell you why it looks fine in the editor without seeing the code, but my guess is something outside of the editor is constraining the images to 200px (other plugin, external css, js, etc) and the editor doesn't have that same constraint, eyeballing it the images in your editor look wider than the live site.",

Hand counting last year was brutal. \n\nOn my site I have a page with all the categories listed, the user clicks on whatever category they want, and places their vote on whatever software is embedded in the page. I'd really like to avoid making people sign in to anything.   \n  \nI was planning on using CrowdSignal, but in testing I found one of my friends is able to vote as many times as they'd like, even though the check box is ticked for once per computer. It locks out everyone else but her. For whatever reason her Iphone with safari sneaks past their cookie based system.\n\nI'm worried about hitting the limit for a free account on Survey Monkey, and I don't want to pay for a full year for a single event.\n\nSogolytics  looks great but they don't allow surveys to be one response only.  With a poll you can only do multiple choice, and it only allows 150 choice inputs. \n\nGoogle Forms requires a google log in to limit to one response.

The Variables get changed by a Media Query with prefers-color-scheme. If the user selects a certain Theme / toggles it, then you save that in the Cookie and read it on side load. When the Cookie is e.g. \"Dark\" then you add the class  \"dark\" to your body and use that to style your site. Because multiple classes are more dominant than a media queries you probably don't even need to do an extra parameter for your media query that toggles it off.\n\nStoring the Data of the prefered Theme in a Cookie is a good idea.

But then I get an annoying popup in the middle of the screen suggesting I go to the localised version of this site instead of the international version.

But no, most of the time it will take me to the homepage of the localised version instead of that thing I want's page. \n\nWho the fuck actually designs such a thing and goes \"ah yes, this is better!\". I cannot grasp why anyone would think this is a good idea. And to top it off, websites sometimes take your \"yes\" as a licence to redirect you to the localised version in future making it hard to go back to where you were. Now I have to delete cookies.\n\nSimilarly is the tendency now to redirect people to the home page if anything goes wrong on an online shop. Big local Australian hardware chain comes to mind. I try to go to the product page of something I needed and found a few days ago, but now it redirects me to the homepage. No explanation, it just does it.

I am looking to gather some information and possibly quotes for someone to develop a website and a logo for me. I do not have a coding/website development background and don't describe myself as creative/artistic so hence why I want to dip my toes in the water to get a rough idea on what this might cost me. Here is what I am looking for:\n\n1. Someone to give advice on domain acquisition and hosting. I have a domain name in mind and it is available.\n2. Someone to create a unique website from scratch. This website will not sell products, it will merely provide an overview of myself, the company, the services we offer, a contact page, etc. I would also like the ability to get to a log in page with some password protected pages for myself or clients. I would also like to use a private part of the site for non-business matters like storing personal pictures or other files. I am envisioning maybe 5 main public pages on the website. I do not have the text written up yet for the pages and I would like the ability to change the text years down the road on my own.\n3. Someone to create a logo that I own the explicate rights to that can be used on the website, business cards, etc.\n4. Someone who can educate me, quantify improvements, and implement actions for Search Engine Optimization.\n\nWith that in mind what questions should I be asking to ensure I am getting apples to apples quotes from people who can provide these services? I know that there are some basic website development tool palates and I am inclined to think that might result in a cookie cutter looking website which I want to avoid. Is this gut feeling valid or not?\n\nThanks!",

However, with more knowledge I could also be better able to direct another if I commission this as a paid for project. I have absolutely no requirement for the site to look good. It simple has to fill the following functions.\n\n* Have a page listings all parts in the database as text (with images provided on hovering the part names) with a text box next to each.\n* Users would put in the number of pieces they have from 0 to 9,999.  \n\n* At the top and bottom of the page would be a save button, that would output to a downloadable text file. Allowing people to save their entrys as text. If its possible to save to cookies that would work too. \n\n[The data output would not include entries for items in which the user stated quantity of 0. There will be an advanced code option to enter and * which will be taken to mean the user does not have the part but wants to system to perform all searches as though the user has 9,999 and any sets listed as a result of the * entry will be highlighted: if all entries are * then the output should be every set highlighted].\n\n* On the 'next' page would be a space to upload the contents of the text file by cut and paste. And a series of questions via tickboxes.\n\n[It should be possible to return to the parts list page after entering the txt file data should one need to make changes].\n* Once the questions are answered the database would output a series of lists.\n\n* The key feature is that the database would be able to output:\n\n1. Sets you can make with your collection.\n2. Sets you can make if you use parts from your collection which do not match the colours in the instructions.\n3. Sets you could make from commercially available parts which were/are not common in retail sets. - The parts in this list will be subjective and set by the admin - by tagging in the database so as to make it easier to update the list.\n\n4. Output would be saved if the user leaves the page and then returns with back or other means.\n\n5. The ability to **invert** the output so it shows only the sets it would usually hide - in each category.\n\n* The database for sets will be searchable by the set codes but the pages for each set would only contain the parts lists for the set and cover art. A PDF of instructions will only be provided for instructions not digitised by the manufacture.\n\n\nAh, a final requirement. There are over 2,000 sets and over 200 parts and over 100 colours. The final output would need to be able to distinguish parts [by shape] from [parts by] colours if asked to. I imagine the best way to do this would be a unique database-only name (or representative hex number) for each part which includes the colour and shape. But I imagine it could be also done by the equivalent of tagging multiple tags to each entry (such as part 1, shape 1, colour 1,).",

Initially, minecraft.net loads the `en-us ` version. If I change the language to `zh-hans` it will persist, even if I clear cookies.\n\nHow is this information being stored? Is there a third-party involved that both of these sites query, or a unique browser ID or something? Is it possible to convince both these sites that I'm not Chinese?\n\n**Solved! When I first visited the minecraft site in Chinese, I used Chrome's built-in translation feature, and somehow Chinese got added to Chrome's language settings, resulting in Chinese being added to my `HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` http header field.**",

        "selftext": "I’ve decided to design a few sites these next coming months and I’m looking for advice on which platforms would be best to use in 2020. \n\nI graduated college in 2016 with experience in coding using Adobe Dreamweaver. I managed to code my own website from top to bottom including some bootstrap modifications, used a CSS (which I’m now learning about scss/sass), used codepen for things like my responsive navigation menu, and illustrator to create images for my portfolio. HOWEVER I am learning that with today’s technology I really should start learning how to use platforms such as WordPress seeing that businesses require you to know how to use it AND it makes coding so much quicker. \n\nSo over this last week, I started building a site in WP and found that you actually need to use their templates for the wireframe (which is 100% editable). However, I learned you need add-on’s to actually edit the content effectively. I have the free version of Elementor but in order to do anything substantial (including editing the appearance of my nav-bar) I need to buy the pro version. FYI I am already paying for the entire Adobe Creative Suite. Before I put money into Elementor, I want to know what are you all using in 2020 t build your sites? \n\nIdeally, this is what I’m looking for. \n• I want to freelance beautiful sites with varying degrees of pages/elements. \n• I don’t want to stress too much about updating my content with today’s constantly updated browsers. \n• I want to build sites at a decent manageable speed. \n• I want my sites to provide my clients with an edge and not just look like every other cookie cutter site. \n• I want my knowledge to transfer over to other jobs in the market (my husband is in the military which means we move a ton) and I’ve considered landing a job with an agency. \n\nI am open to any knowledge and advice you may have. I’m pretty new to the coding world.",

It can be set up to work like any database, clients are mostly familiar with the interface and you can limit the exact scope of what you want them to be able to edit. [https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/php](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/php) that's the official docs, but there's also some PHP wrappers & tutorials etc that you can surely find if you search around for a bit",

                "body": "IMO using 3D is quite risky simply because users are used to certain paradigms in interfaces. You scroll vertically to see more content, links either open new pages / popups or scroll somewhere else, etc. Anything out of the ordinary needs to be extra thought out to feel natural and not confusing. One way to achieve that is by building on top of existing experiences the user might have.\n\nA fantastic example [is this site](https://bruno-simon.com/), where you drive an RC car around the pages \"landscape\". It works because almost everyone has played a game where you steer a car, so you already know the controls, and also it's just plain fun.\n\nVR, on the other hand, is tricky. You need to port the experience to a 2D screen in the end, which comes with all the problems VR is trying to solve - navigating, manipulating content etc.\n\nSo if I were you, I would pick from these options -\n\n* The \"toy car game\" approach, where it's a fun, familiar experience\n* Keep using \"normal\" interfaces, but use 3D for backgrounds and flourishes that responds to scroll / mouse movements, like [here for example](https://go.pioneer.com/cornrevolution) or [here](https://www.orano.group/experience/innovation/en/protect).\n\nOf course, it depends on what the website is actually about. If it's for yourself personally to experiment with, it would probably be fun to try to do something unorthodox with [threejs](https://threejs.org/) or push 3D CSS to its limits.",
