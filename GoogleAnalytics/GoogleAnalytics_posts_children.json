        "selftext": "Hi!  \nI am looking for recommendations on how to correctly set up Google Analytics and Google Ads for a client who has a parent site and multiple child domains. My client is an insurance agency with a parent domain. The individual insurance agents have their own child domains.  \nI run ads for the entire agency as a whole, using the parent domain as the final URL, tracking on their own Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and the owner's Google Ad account.  \nHere's where I am stuck... There's a specific insurance agent who wants to run Google Ads to promote her specific landing page (child domain). Should I create her own separate Google Analytics account for her child site? Her site already has the parent domain Google Analytics installed. Should I create her own Google Tag Manager account and install her Google Analytics account that way? Would her Google Analytics only track website data from her child site and not the parent domain?  \nNow with Google Ads, here's where I am nervous. I manage ads for the agency as a whole. This agent would be paying for her ads separately. To do this, I would need to create a new ad account. That account technically would have the same domain and would be technically the same name too. From what I read in a discussion on the Google Ads Help forum, \"You can't have two Ads accounts for same business/website. This is policy violation and you can search this community that so many users already suspending for having two Ads accounts. Google Ads policy is very simple and only one account is allowed per business/website/domain/person/organization/payment.\"  \nSo now I am questioning everything because I do not want to risk suspending the entire agency's Google Ad account due to a misunderstanding on structuring accounts specifically for parent/child domains. Thank you for reading, and appreciate any recommendations.",

I would have on the account level the company as a whole hold all of the child down different containers.\n\n* Parent Company Account\n   * Child domain container 1\n   * Childer domain container 2, etc\n\nThis way I can separate GA4 accounts. For GA4 .... i think it depends on their business as a whole but I don't think it would hurt for each domain to have their own GA4 account. BUT again I have no idea what their busienss structure is like. I separate GA4 accounts for my client due to some of the marketing tools each location uses. You can set up each location to only show traffic for that child domain, OR for the entire domain. Again that depends on their business goals.\n\nFor Google Ads, I haven't ran into this issue yet because only one location owner is running ads. However, I feel like there are thousands of businesses around the world that have similar structures are what you're dealing with. Google knows that, so there has to be a solution somehow. Can you create ppc specific landing pages for that one insurance agent? on a subdomain...would that violate any rules?",

That's the answer to your question.\n\n\\*You didn't mention landing page, but using page referrer would be mixing apples and oranges.  If a user's previous page (referrer) is outside your domain, they will still have a entrance or landing page inside.  Plus, referrer is a value that is easily lost by misconfigurations, so it might be blank in a number of situations.\n\n\\*To best illustrate the answer, I suggest the following exploration:\n\nDimensions: Page Path plus Query string, Landing page  \nMetrics: Total Users, Sessions, Views, Entrances  \nAdd a Filter on the page in question...use \"contains\"...remove hostname and any query parameters.\n\nThe first row under totals is most likely those who visited the page AND entered there.   The remaining rows explain the views for those who didn't.    Users and sessions help explain audience size and if they come back.     Page reloads or page refreshes is not an easy metric to get; but it shouldn't be a major factor anyways.\n\n\\*Start with Landing Page, then try referrer instead, then try both.  (The report might become unwieldly with both).   Despite my comments about page referrer,  add it in and see if it adds anything with these metrics.\n\nConclusions:\n\n\\*Including users and sessions shows some aspects that many people might not think of: there might be a much smaller group of users responsible for activity, and these users might be coming back multiple times.\n\n\\*This exploration allows you to answer a number of business questions, not just the one posed here.\n\nPlease let us know how it goes!",

The report that shows the ROI on my ad campaigns that I used to have in the UA version simply doesn't work in GA4.\n\nMy e-commerce purchases report is completely empty and I definitely have sales, as the UA will still report. Both tags for UA and GA4 are under each other in my Shopify theme, so you'd think they measure the same?\n\nI'm ready to thrown my mouse across my office (just kidding, I'm a pretty calm guy). I just can't seem to find out why GA4 isn't showing the purchases on my site.\n\nHas anyone else have the same issue happen?",

My impression is GA automatically sends visitor data from UA tracker to GA4, but not the e-commerce conversions or events.\n\nNot sure if it's by design or a one-off bug.\n\nSwitching website tracker to GA4 measurement id fixed it for me.",
