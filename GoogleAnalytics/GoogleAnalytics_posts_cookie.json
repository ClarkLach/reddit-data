You’ll always see at least one for your own GA4, and if you're using the Google & YouTube app for Merchant Center or Google Ads, it might be adding another. But the extra ones you’re seeing probably come from third-party apps or services embedded on your site.\n\nThings like review widgets (Yotpo, Judge.me), chat apps, email platforms, or even embedded YouTube videos can inject their own GA4 tags. Some of these services track usage through their own Analyticss accounts, which causes extra '\\_ga\\_XXXX' cookies to appear.\n\nTo figure out which ID belongs to what, open your browser’s DevTools by hitting F12 or right-click > 'inspect', go to the Network tab, and look for GA4 collect requests (filter for something like 'collect?v=2'). Each request will include a 'tid=G-XXXXXXX' which is the Measurement ID. You can match these back to the cookie names.\n\nAlso check your installed apps and your theme code to see if anythings hardcoding other GA tags or loading third-party scripts. And if you're using server-side GTM, make sure you're not accidentally duplicating tracking somewhere.\n\nHope this helps!",

For the most part, standard web analytics user tracking applications will work just fine.\n\nThe issue is more with some of the GA4 advertising features. GA4 technically has had the capabilities of attributing website sessions to various forms of advertising. This included ad interactions where a user viewed an ad but didn’t click immediately and then later went to your website and explored and converted. 3P cookies are a way of identifying a user on one domain and then being able to recognize them on another - so the ability to serve a user a display ad on publisher123.com and then to recognize and properly attribute them to that ad view is one of the main features that is somewhat impacted. Another one would be if you use GA4 audiences for remarketing. Remarketing is an action that requires a lot of 3P cookies currently to identify a user on your website and reach them on other 3P inventory.\n\nIf you’re not as concerned with some of the remarketing and view through conversion applications of GA4, 3P cookie deprecation doesn’t really seem like a big deal for you.\n\nFor some use cases that require 3P cookies, you can instead update your GA4 events to collect hashed User Provided Data in order to recover some of the 3p cookie functionality that has been/will be lost.",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI work for a small ecommerce company managing digital marketing and the website including SEO. We are hosted on Squarespace. The site is 6 years old, and I took the site management over in 5 years ago. Since taking over in 2020 There has been a fairly consistent growth in page views and visitors  according to google analytics and squarespace analytics. If there was ever a \"dip\" in the KPIs, it lasted only a month or two then resumed the normal rate of slow yet steady growth.\n\nIn May I implemented the new google cookie rules (options for both accept and decline). After that we have seen continuous drops in our page views and visitors. Our google search impressions are going up consistently month by month, and our google search clicks are staying steady, oscillating up and down but more or less the same (with google clicks there is no overall growth or decline, just stagnation).\n\nI've been working consistently on SEO, our onpage audits are always good (speed, headings, etc), and recently I have been reworking our meta data and content to reflect new keyword strategies.\n\nI am assuming this declind/stagnation is due to the cookies change because that is the first month I noticed it.\n\nAs another note, consequential or not I do not know, until 2024 I used squarespace analytics and google analytics in conjunction as they were always very similar, within 1% of each other on visit data. However, in the last months of 2023 and fisrt month of 2024 I noticed that squarespace began to jump wildly, sometimes showing a literal 1000% growth in one month, where google portrayed the usual small but steady growth rate. Then squarespace would drop to near 0, then back up way high. It was so wild and varied, and squarespace tech support gave me 0 answers (or rather, they told me their analytics were mere estimation tools and were not 100% accurate), so as of February of 2024 I switched to 100% only google analytics, only trusting squarespace for KPIs such as form submissions or order info.\n\nHas anyone noticed in the last 6 months declines in traffic? With the new cookie laws is it possible that google is no longer able to accurately track visits, page views, and visitor data?\n\nThank you for any help or advice.",

        "id": "1eia6ym",
        "selftext": "As you may, or may not, know, Chrome has been trying for years now to adapt their navigation to a cookie-less enviroment. First tests on Privacy Sandbox (you can find all the infos here https://privacysandbox.com/), started 6th february 2024, resulted in high-hopes by the publishers and an overall euphoria, given by the possibility to have a session-based traffic (on-device processing, meaning all meaningful events are saved directly on the device, without the need of a stable internet connection or any response from external servers ), a higher user safeguard and an overall open discussion regarding the technical parts of this enviroment, making all stakehoders involved into the development.  \nIs of few days ago the decision from Google to \"hold onto\" third-party-cookie (in Chrome) for the time being, giving the direct choice to the users to either remove the third-party-cookies or keeping them.  \n  \nI have, as the major stakeholders, mixed feeling about the Privacy Sandbox:  \n**Pros**:  \nhis update would level Chrome to other browsers (Firefox, Safari etc.) which already adopted a no-third-party-cookie approach to the navigation. The on-device processing measurement would be a huge benefit for all Marketing Agencies and Freelancers, since you would get a timely report of your campaings. Another useful part of this Privacy Sandbox, expecially for all you privacy savvys, is a much more clear collection process regarding the personal information of the user, made more intuitive for non-tecnical user.\n\n  \n**Cons**:  \nYou can find [here](https://www.iabuk.com/news-article/iab-tech-lab-releases-results-privacy-sandbox-gap-analysis) an article by IAB, regarding the analysis made by more then 60+ participant companies in the first round of testing.  \nIn this analysis emerges the huge gap that would be created with Privacy Sandbox, and I quote:  \n“several crucial functions within Sandbox – including frequency capping, video advertising, audience creation, and impression counting – … either lack support or face limitations”.  \nThe problem arise with audience management, auction dynamics, creative and rendering, reporting, and technology and interoperability as well.  \n  \nGoogle came back with a response to the IAB article (you can find it [here](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/blog/iab-tech-lab-response)), basically discarding the analysis as \"misunderstood and inaccurate\", and trying to stress the \"broad scope\" of the Privacy Sandbox.  \nThe tests of the enviroment finished on 22th March 2024, with a final consideration by the main stakeholders, an I quote:  \n\"The Privacy Sandbox initiative, while aimed at bolstering user privacy, introduces significant hurdles for the digital ad economy.\"  \nBut the real main concern is for the final users, as stated here:  \n\"In its current form, the Privacy Sandbox may limit the industry’s ability to deliver **relevant**, **effective** advertising, placing smaller media companies and brands at a significant competitive disadvantage.\"\n\nWhat this means is that, not only that the fear of losing revenues for small media companies is more than real, but expecially this would make Google a real gate-keeper of ADV (CMA has concerns over this as well, as written [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6631088cd0030b10e56a5084/CMA_Q4_2023.pdf). Quoting: \"Google cannot proceed with third-party cookie deprecation until our concerns have been resolved\").\n\n  \n**Final Considerations:**  \nAs stated before the final considerations are... mixed. \n\nI hope this update on the tracking world will bring an easier integration between platforms and a more precise tracking, protecting the user privacy. I do see the logical problem in this (how can I have a precise tracking if the user needs to be anonymous?). The cross-device tracking will always be a thorn in my back, and with this new update, I guess the thorn will stay right in his place.\n\nThis post is for open discussion and personal experience about this update, so please feel free to add or correct any of the information I wrote, given a valid surce.  \nHappy tracking (not for long eheh).",

        "selftext": "This is driving me insane.\n\nI have a domain (domain.com) and a subdomain (sub.domain.com). My sub domain is a landing page that i host on webflow and the main domain is hosted on shopify.\n\nI need to run Google ads directly to the landing page, but they will complete their purchase on shopify. To test this i have just added /?gclid=test123 to the URL on a new cookie free browser window. Now, if i add that appendage to the main domain and go into developer tools it works fine - its staring right back at me albeit with the Shopify nuance. If i then visit my sub-domain its also still there as it carries over - happy days.\n\nHowever, if i first head to my subdomain with a fresher browser window and start there - the cookie just doesn't get registered. Its not in developer tools at all. Any idea how i can fix this ? My assumption is that its important as new visitors will be passing through the subdomain first when they click on our ads.\n\nIts probably worth stating that both the domain and subdomain are setup using G tags in GA4, each as their own datastream but in the same property. In debug mode they both register just fine, even if i start on my subdomain with a new browser.\n\nI'm sure for someone with a developer background this is a dead easy fix.\n\nAny advice appreciated!",

A cookie with the domain set to example.com will also work on sub.example.com, but pretty sure it's not the other way around. GA4 with a single data stream fixes this.",

When certain consents are denied then the tag will only sent \"pings\" like a door bell without PII.

What the analytics drop is can vary greatly by any number of factors - the design of your banner, your consent model, your industry, etc...  \n\n\nThe longer answer and can-of-worms is that every cookie consent banner and solution is different. As a matter of fact, over 50% of them don't even do anything if you decline from a study that was done. And some tools, like Google Tag Manager's consent mode, still might even send a cookieless ping to GA4 to track some data if a user opts out.\n\nOr, maybe for EU visitors it requires \"explicit\" consent to set cookies, but in North America it's \"implicit\" and sets cookies by default. This could affect how you analyze traffic between the two regions.\n\nUnfortunately, those are just a few considerations. There is a lot here.\n\nUltimately, you'd need to work with the person that implemented your banner to understand exactly how it works.

An index.html file with blank page. I want to basically know how many visitors I had. I create a GA data stream for web and disable enhanced measurements, then add GA4 by adding gtag.js to head tag. On dev environment I can see in dev tools there are two cookies named like _ga. I thought that’s fine, but I saw that some EU countries started to find GA illegal. \n\nTherefore I have few questions:\n\n1 Do I need a cookie banner? If yes, then…\n\n2 Does it just says that website uses cookies? Because, if there is this script in head tag then there is already no any opt-out and opt-in. Because, there aren’t any more cookies to consent or not.",

Who else has dealt with this and what did you do? \n\n**EDIT: I found a clumsy work around.** See below for what I did. \n\nThe way that I was finally able to access my Google Analytics account:\n\nI repeatedly was searching “missing permissions error Google Analytics” etc. One of those many searches led me to this page on the Google Support forum: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6132368?sjid=14850073660619333886-NA\n\nThere’s a link there to “Admin”, which takes you to your account’s admin page. Simply trying to go to analytics.google.com was leading to the missing permissions screen, so you have to find another way to get there.\n\nWhen I reached this admin page, I saw that the first property in my portfolio, in alphabetical order, had recently been moved to the Trash. This was because this client is no longer working with us. Analytics automatically goes to the first property, which I had deleted, so instead of going to the next one it just wouldn’t let me access my account at all. Makes no sense.\n\nOnce I had reached that admin screen, I was able to click through and access my other properties. \n\nWhat I also did at that time was go into each and every single property & find “Account access management”. I added another email address as a backup admin just in case.\n\nSince then, it appears that going to that admin link – https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/?pagename=admin&utm_source=gahc&utm_medium=dlinks – is a way to get into the account without running into the permissions error. Bookmarking that link has been helpful for me as well. There are probably other ways to get around this error, but finding an alternative way into your account seems to be the answer if you can do it, since https://analytics.google.com just doesn’t f*cking work if you’ve deleted a property at any time.\n\nThis has been a problem with Google Analytics for 6+ years now. I have seen hundreds of people struggling with this with absolutely zero solutions posted, dating back years, and it appears Google has done nothing to solve this either. There are no definitive fixes posted anywhere for this problem. Absolutely ridiculous. ",

That explains the repeat GA1.1..\n\nIf your GA4 \"client ID\" is showing as \"not set,\" it means that Google Analytics is unable to generate a unique identifier for a user on your website, likely due to issues with your tracking code implementation, cookie settings, or incorrect configuration in your Google Tag Manager, preventing proper user tracking and data collection. \nKey reasons why your GA4 client ID might not be set:\n\nIncorrect tracking code installation:\n\nDouble-check that your GA4 tracking code is correctly placed on every relevant page of your website. \n\nCookie blocking:\n\nBrowser settings or ad-blocking extensions might be preventing the necessary cookies for storing the client ID. \n\nIncorrect Tag Manager setup:\n\nIf using Google Tag Manager, ensure your GA4 tag is configured correctly and firing properly. \n\nCustom user ID not set:\n\nIf you're trying to link user accounts across devices, make sure you are correctly passing a user ID through your tracking code. \n\nServer-side tracking issues:\n\nIf you're using server-side tracking, ensure the client ID is being sent correctly from your server to Google Analytics. \nHow to troubleshoot and fix \"not set\" client ID:\n\nCheck your tracking code:\n\nReview your website's HTML code to confirm the GA4 tracking code is properly placed on every relevant page. \n\nInspect browser cookies:\n\nUse your browser developer tools to check if the necessary GA4 cookies are being set and if their values are correct. \n\nVerify Google Tag Manager configuration:\n\nIf using GTM, review your GA4 tag setup, including the data layer variables and triggers. \nCheck for cookie blocking:\nReview browser settings and any ad-blocking extensions to ensure they are not preventing GA4 cookies. \nReview your user ID implementation:\nIf you are using a custom user ID, double-check that it is being passed correctly to the GA4 tracking code. \nUse Google Analytics Debugger:\nThe Google Analytics Debugger tool can help identify issues with your tracking code by providing real-time feedback on sent data. \nImportant points to remember:\nClient ID is unique per device and browser:\nA user visiting your site from different browsers or devices will be assigned different client IDs. \n\"Not set\" can appear in other dimensions too:\nIf you see \"not set\" in other GA4 reports, it often means missing data due to incorrect tracking setup.",

If they are just there to evaluate the sites performance over time, it's probably your best bet. \n\nHowever, if you are being measured by all of these KPI's, then they seem very broad and a little unfair imo. As an individual I wouldn't think you have the power to change all of them.\n\ne.g. If you're an add specialist, add to carts and abandon carts aren't great KPI's, they are metrics you want to be aware of, but they shouldn't affect your employers view on your performance unless you're in charge of design and UX as well. \n\nIf you're an ads specialist, I would be focusing more on ROAS that you define with your employer.\n\nAt the end of the day, as a digital marketer, the best metric is always going to be, did you increase how much money your company made through your channels by more than the amount it cost to achieve that change in performance. \n\nBoth of those metrics should be available without the data in GA4.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nTo leave you with an actionable, if you feel like not enough people are opting in to cookies. Maybe think about the design, location and layout of your cookie banner. There are definitely ways to optimize opt in rates in ethical ways. \n\nHere’s a few tips we give our customers to maximize their acceptance rates, hopefully there's something useful in there for you.\n\n1. Test different banner positions - bottom-right corner placement typically achieves higher acceptance rates in our experience. \n2. Use clear, simple language focused on benefits to users rather than technical details. Users make initial judgments about interface elements within 3 seconds. \n3. Maintain visual consistency with your website's design. Don’t break the experience with contrast, tie the banner to your sites trust. \n4. Trial letting users modify choices by category (essential, marketing, analytics) rather than just using an accept/reject all button. \n5. Test different timings for banner appearance rather than showing it immediately on page load. Sometimes that window of investment gives a user enough momentum to accept if they know they're getting a return from your site.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions\n\nRegards,\n\nAlistair",

Without being able to tell if that traffic is resulting in sales its impossible to know what our ROI is on ad spend.  \n  \nWe've worked with the company who manages our web maintenance as well as another contractor to try to resolve the issue after failing to resolve it ourselves and got basically the same answer I was running into on my own: **\"It** ***should*** **be working. So I don't know how to fix it.\"**\n\nSome details:\n\n\\- Ads direct to our main, Wordpress hosted, website (A) and then if a purchase is to be made they are redirected to our registration software (B)  \n\\- We have tested ads that direct to both sites A and B and it doesn't make a difference  \n\\- Both sites A and B are reporting traffic (and in the case of B, revenue) in GA4 from all other sources  \n\\- The pixel is installed and firing  \n\\- UTMs are being used  \n\\- NO traffic is showing under Paid Social\n\nWhen I reach out to potential agencies to help I run into two problems:  \n1) we're a tiny nonprofit without a budget for this so we just need this issue resolved and not to be sold a bunch of other services we don't need  \n2) the Meta experts say it sounds like a GA4 problem and the GA4 folks say it sounds like a Meta problem, or they both say it must be problem with website B's platform, that they don't know anything about. \n\n**I'm really hoping anyone has ideas as to what may be happening here. I've got leadership asking me a couple times a week why this isn't resolved yet and I'm at a loss.**\n\n  \nHere are the most recent notes I was provided. They didn't give me any next steps:  \n  \n\"This is where my expertise most likely ends, as from what I can tell, something on your site is either blocking the UTM parameters to properly set the cookie to the parameters. I've tried from different computers, signed in/signed out, different computer (not mine) on a different wifi, sent links for others to try, some with UTMs the same, some with different and not of my UTM parameters that I randomly created and tested (probably about 25) ever showed in your account as traffic coming from.  They simply didn't show.  Similar to where you found one visit and no others.   \n  \nFrankly I've never seen this and do not know of any setting in GA4 that would prevent this. I should be able to clear my cache or got to a different computer, pop in a random UTM parameter into the URL and see it in the real-time report less than a minute after I hit the page. I can see I hit the page, I can see the parameter in the URL, but still says I'm from direct traffic. I do it as the same time to another site, same random parameter, and in real-time report see the page hit and the UTM campaign parameter I set. I've troubleshooted the basic, right parameters, pages tagged, no issue with length of URL, redirects, etc. all of which has been ruled out. I have to assume it something on the site that is causing it, either blocking it or interfering with it.\"\n\n***Does anyone have insight into this issue? The same issue?

UTMs are URL query string parameters, like any other URL query string parameter. Google 'knows' to treat a select group of 9 URL query string parameters that start with utm\\_ differently from other URL query string parameter and automatically process them into Google Analytics. There is no 'special' effort to process the UTMs with cookies. It sounds like something else is going on. Do you have server side redirect that truncate the incoming URL query strings? Are you miss using the 'standard' events page\\_location or client\\_id in such a way that you are corrupting your data? Generally speaking, you should not touch 'client\\_id'. And you should only modify 'page\\_location' if you have 1) an SPA, and 2) are setting page\\_location to a complete, well formed URL. Otherwise you leave those alone. Do you have Javascript that wipes out the dataLayer? Have you recently implemented a CSP that will block the running of scripts, including Google Analytics? Are you using UTMs on internal links on your web site (you should never do that)? That you see the parameters in the URL and it says \"direct traffic\" is often the result of bad server side redirects that truncate the URL query string parameters.",

We are taking a different approach as an experiment for measuring site usage.\n\nWe are sending a request with a single page\\_view event with the following data\n\n* client\\_id is a guid that is set in a cookie that has a rolling expiry of 2 years i.e. will update on each hit, or get generated if it doesn't exist.\n* session\\_id is a guid that is set in a cookie that has a rolling expiry of 30 minutes. Will update expiry or create a new one if it doesn't exist.\n* engagement\\_time\\_msec is set as an arbitrary \"100\" ms\n* page\\_location for the absolute url\n* page\\_title\n* We aren't sending a timestamp, instead leaving that up to Google (at the moment)\n* There is no attribution, referral or geo information sent with the request. We are interested in totals rather than journey\n\nData all seems to be coming through fine, users and pages in real time, and exploration looks as expected, but the session count seems off, where the session count is always slightly less than the user count.\n\nWe are running GA4 tracking on the client as a separate instance (not linked at all), and the sessions show a lot more, which is what I would expect as users tend to visit the site through-out the day.\n\nBecause this is a pretty much considered a hack, I am not necessarily expecting a \"fix\" but rather an understanding of what is happening.\n\nThanks,  \nJ",

Thought it just needed to be a unique value.\n   * Unix timestamp in seconds won't be unique, but it should be calculated correctly with the combo of client\\_id and session\\_id\n* Added a timestamp\\_micros to the request and for each event. Not sure if that's redundant, but shouldn't hurt\n* Added custom\\_session\\_start and custom\\_first\\_visit events when a new client or session cookie is created.

Add the \"autolink\" setting in GA4 tags for both domains. Also, double-check outbound link settings to ensure the data is passed correctly. If it’s still an issue, try Qwestify—it’s easy to set up and works well for cookie-less tracking across domains!",

I understand it somewhat and suspect my brain just won't let go of the old school way of viewing data. But am I insane?\n\nWe have a GAds campaign that only points to one page (of many) on our website, let's call it /landingpage.html.\n\nIn April, GA4 reports 482 clicks. Historically, same user multiple clicks percentage is very low. \n\nFor April Reports | Engagement | Landing Page...\n\nGA4 shows for /landingpage.html All Users = 89 Sessions 108\n\nGA4 shows for /landingpage.html Paid Users = 53 Sessions 60\n\nEven though Paid Users is a subset of All Users, even if we had them together 168 is a far cry from 482. Even if half the clicks were duplicates (they're not, but just saying) that's 241.\n\nIs GA4 really, actually only able to monitor and report on 25% of website traffic? I know Ad Blockers and Browser that do not accept cookies accounts for a lot of missed click data, but not 75%. Old school adjustment would be 5%-20% (not set or direct / none).\n\nDo I need a psychiatrist to figure this out or just say f\\*\\*k it. Data does not exist.\n\n",

Additionally, all our other media channels (**Meta, Geofencing, etc.**) are **UTM-tagged**, allowing us to track the **source/medium** of traffic and measure **leads, calls, and user activity** during our campaign.\n\nI understand that **soft metrics** like **link clicks** don’t always translate **1:1** to **GA4 sessions** due to **privacy restrictions and cookie limitations**. However, this discrepancy seems **more pronounced** when analyzing **DV360 data**.\n\n# Example:\n\n* **Meta (December Data)**\n   * **13,947 link clicks**\n   * **12,498 GA4 sessions**\n   * Not a perfect match, but fairly close.\n* **DV360 Lead Gen Campaign**\n   * **8,607 reported clicks**\n   * **143 reported conversions** (tracked through **click-to-call** and a **soft lead button event** on the landing page)\n   * **GA4 Data:**\n      * **67 sessions reported**\n      * **0 soft leads or calls** attributed to the source/medium\n\nUpon further investigation, I noticed that some **landing page query strings** containing **utm\\_source=youtube** were **attributed to Google CPC** instead of YouTube/DV360.\n\n# The Question\n\nWhy is our **YouTube/DV360** data **not appearing** correctly in **GA4**? This issue seems **unique to DV360/YouTube**, as our other channels track properly. Despite **DV360 reporting conversions**, we can’t **connect** them properly in **GA4**—possibly due to **tracking loss** or being **overwritten by Google CPC attribution**.\n\n# Additional Context\n\n* Our **GA4 attribution model** is set to **Data-Driven**, but we are open to testing other models if that could resolve the issue.\n* This discrepancy also occurs with **other third-party vendors running display/OTT (streaming) ads** to a landing page. While streaming traffic behaves differently, I wanted to mention it in case it’s relevant.\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar issue? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!",

                "body": "This is a very common and frustrating problem when bridging the gap between DV360/YouTube click data and GA4 session/conversion attribution, especially given the increased impact of privacy and tracking restrictions.\n\nThe core of the issue you're seeing is likely a combination of tracking loss due to browser restrictions like Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP), your GA4 attribution model's handling of view-through conversions, and the way GA4's native integrations prioritize data.\n\nThe most likely culprit for the sessions being misattributed to Google CPC is the presence of the gclid parameter on your landing page URL, which is used for Google Ads tracking.\n\nWhen traffic comes from YouTube ads managed through DV360, it often contains both DV360's dclid parameter and the gclid parameter if the inventory is running on YouTube or a Google-owned property and linked to a Google Ads account.\n\nGA4's default processing and the Google Ads integration tend to prioritize the `gclid`, which tells GA4 the click came from a Google-managed source, and it attributes it using the *Google Ads* integration logic, often resulting in attribution to `google / cpc` or \"cross-network\" depending on the campaign type, rather than `dv360 / cpm` or `youtube / cpm` as you might expect.\n\nThe low session count in GA4 (67 sessions vs. 8,607 clicks) strongly suggests high levels of tracking prevention are blocking the GA4 script from firing or cookies from being set, particularly for traffic from in-app or cross-site contexts, which is common for DV360/YouTube.\n\nThe conversions that DV360 reports (143) are likely view-through conversions or attributed based on a *much* longer lookback window and different methodology than GA4's session-based tracking, which explains the enormous discrepancy.\n\nTo address both the tracking loss and the misattribution, you should consider implementing a server-side tagging solution combined with the Google Ads Conversions API (GAC API).\n\nA setup using Google Tag Manager (GTM) for initial data capture, then sending that data through Stape.io (a managed server-side tagging environment) to the GAC API is an excellent solution.\n\nServer-side tracking reduces dependency on client-side browser cookies, making your tracking more resilient against ITP and other privacy-related restrictions.\n\nInstead of the user's browser sending data directly to GA4 and Google Ads, it sends a single, first-party request to your Stape.io server, which then forwards the data to GA4 and the GAC API.\n\nThis method significantly improves the reliability and longevity of user identifiers.\n\nUsing the GAC API allows you to send conversion events directly from your server to Google Ads, providing a more complete and accurate picture of conversion actions that aren't lost due to client-side tracking failures.\n\nThis is particularly good for DV360/YouTube campaigns because it helps Google Ads (which is often linked to DV360) attribute conversions more accurately, even if the GA4 session tracking fails.\n\nFurthermore, by carefully configuring your server-side GTM, you can gain greater control over how the attribution parameters (like gclid or dclid) are handled and passed, potentially allowing you to force attribution to the desired DV360 source, though the native GA4 prioritization will still be strong.\n\nYou will be sending higher-quality, server-validated data to Google, improving conversion modeling and bidding efficiency for your DV360 campaigns.\n\nWhile you're open to testing other attribution models, the underlying tracking loss is the more critical issue, and server-side tagging addresses that head-on.",

From my understanding:\n\n* GA4 does not start a new session when a user returns from a different source/medium, as long as they return within 30 minutes.\n* The original session source remains the same, but the new source/medium is logged at the event level (session\\_source, session\\_medium).\n\nA new session only starts if:\n\n* The user is inactive for 30+ minutes before coming back.\n* The session crosses midnight.\n* The user clears cookies or switches devices.\n\nThis is a major shift from UA’s behavior, where a new session was always created when a user returned via a different source.\n\nCan anyone confirm if this understanding is correct?

Then they are taken to the e-commerce page (there's a unique ID on this page but this is the only time it shows up) and can start shopping. The thing is the choice gets saved in the users cookies, so the next time they visit the page, they don't have to make the choice again and the ID doesn't show up either.\n\nI wanted to ask for your suggestions on how to segment these two audiences on GA4?

These spikes have, according to Google Analytics, brought in almost 4,000 contact form submission key events over the past 96 days or so. However, this doesn't really make any sense on the other end of things — my client has not reported any issues with spam form submissions or even an uptick in form submissions, and the average time spent on the page by all visitors is 2 seconds, which is definitely not enough to fill in all the required fields of the contact form and hit Submit. All traffic driving these spikes originates in the United States. Narrowing visitors down by city reveals an even spread of visitors from a very large range of cities.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what an explanation might be for this? I'm not sure if this is spam, or bots, or genuine statistics, and can't really make sense of the data from my knowledge of the circumstances around it and my limited grasp on how to further diagnose these statistics. Please excuse my ignorance if this question has an obvious answer, I haven't been trained in analytics and I'm just a graphic designer that was put on analytics monitoring duty and I feel completely out of my depth with this issue.

                "body": "Hi! There are three parts to this: 1) GA4 setup, 2) GTM setup, 3) Reporting  \n  \nFirst, here's Google's documentation that I think Op is referring to:\n\n[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9213390?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9213390?hl=en)\n\n1) The GA4 part recommends that you update the reporting identity to include UserID.  I'm not an expert here, and rely on others to add comments, but I believe this is done to enable UseriD to be used in the GA4 UI and to avoid cardinality issues.    There's a bunch of stuff you can do with User Id.\n\n2) The GTM setup is simple: the only difficult part is reading or storing the value in a cookie, or having your devlelopers push it to the data layer.\n\n3) Reporting: This is the most troublesome part....I do NOT recommend sending UserID to your CRM, at least with Phase 1.\n\nI'm assuming that UserID is kept in a separate database?   The web authentication server?  Regardless of where it is, you'll eventually need a report from this source with Customer name, user id, and whatever other data is needed. \n\nYou'll use Looker Studio, or query BigQuery to get the data wantedUserID\n\nI don't see why cardinality would be an issue here.  I saw the Google caution, and I would recommend disregarding it.  Remember, Cardinality is Google's problem, not yours.   They're trying to get people to use data efficiently, I assume.  It should be perfectly fine to run a report based on UserID. It's not like you're going to have millions of unique values..\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nGoogle's documentation spells it out for you here, with step by step instructions for GTM:\n\n[https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/user-id?sjid=6942166150031227692-NC&client\\_type=gtm](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/user-id?sjid=6942166150031227692-NC&client_type=gtm)\n\n1) For this to work, you'll need to have UserID in the data layer for your website.  Have your developers add some code to push it, or read the value from a cookie and push it.   I used to use GTM's custom HTML tag for this type of stuff, but that's frowned upon nowadays:\n\n    dataLayer.push({\n      'user_id': 'USER_ID'});\n\n2) Create a variable in GTM for the value\n\n3) Modify the Google tag so this value is a Configuration parameter, using the variable from Step #2.\n\nWith these three steps, UserID will be populated automatically with the user's actions.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*",

This can increase (not set) even more if you choose the option to log an additional event when audience membership refreshes.  \nThis can happen because these audience creation events are not associated with other sessions. But since it all happens in the back end of GA4, it’s hard to know what’s causing it every time.  \nYour safest bet is to use fewer audience triggers and not log an additional event when the audience refreshes.",

        "selftext": "Hi!\n\n**Problem Context:**\n\nI'm setting up Google Analytics for my company which has (1) a public website and (2) a gated access dashboard for users. These two websites have different domains. As a user, I can click on a button on the public website » enter my login details » reach the dashboard. However, there are also other traffic sources for the dashboard, e.g. third party applications that will lead users to this dashboard.\n\n**Business Need:**\n\nThe top priority will be to see the analytics for *the public website only*.\n\nHowever, it would be great if we could also see:\n\n1. An aggregated analytics view for users across both (1) and (2), including the conversion funnel of users navigating from the public website to the account dashboard.\n2. Analytics for the *gated-access dashboard only*.\n\nHow would you recommend me to set up my Google Analytics? Based on my research, it seems like Google recommends for **one property + one data stream (for the public website) with cross-domain tracking enabled for the dashboard**. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to see the analytics for the dashboard only (e.g. acquisition, bounce; referring traffic aside from the public website) with this approach.\n\nAlternatively, I am considering **setting (1) and (2) as separate data streams under the same property**. But it seems like Google doesn’t advise having more than one web data stream. Also, if I were to configure cross-domain tracking, it seems like they need to have the same measurement ID, so I’m not sure how that works either. Any perspectives please?\n\n---\n\n**Update:**\n\nThanks for all the replies so far! As a quick follow up: We've just discovered that we may be unable to get cross-domain tracking to work, because from public website » user login » dashboard, the user login gate is shared across all teams in our organization and beyond our team's control. As such, we won't be able to get the \\_gl parameter to persist to the dashboard website.\n\nGiven this issue, should we still proceed with one data stream + cross domain tracking, or what alternative approach should we consider?",

If so, what’s the best method to do this? Can I use custom events or another approach?\n2. **Tracking Revenue Across Multiple Users in the Same Account:**\n   * In our SaaS product, one user typically creates the company account and then invites additional team members. All these users should ideally be linked to the same company account in GA4.\n   * Is there a way in GA4 to assign different users to a single company account? I was thinking about user groups or some other solution, but I’m not sure how to implement this effectively.\n\n# I know there're standalone solutions like Mixpanel for this, but that needs a lot of implementation as well.

I recently moved from using WooCommerce to a bespoke e-commerce platform. \n\nThe move went live on the 25th of March, and from the 28th I’m seeing most of my revenue within an ‘unassigned’ channel. The revenue to other channels like organic search, direct etc are all very very low \n\nWhat’s weird is that the 26th and 27th don’t have much revenue in ‘unassigned’ but no changes were made between the 27th and 28th. \n\nTo make it weirder (for me!) is that some revenue is still going to other channels like organic, but the majority goes to ‘unassigned’\n\nI know GA4 has a processing lag which can see unassigned revenue get allocated to the correct channel after 24/48 hours but as this has been over a week I don’t think it’s the processing time. \n\nAny thoughts or ideas on where to look would be great!\n\nAlso - the new booking platform is on a subdomain. I’ve checked my cookie tracking through the main domain, onto the subdomain and onto the order confirmation page so it is tracking me as one user throughout, and I’ve added the subdomain to the GA4 data stream domains \n\nI added the domain to the referral exclusion list yesterday incase that helped\n\nThanks!",

There is a country/language banner, a cookie banner. My hypothesis is that one of these might break the journey after which the session is seen as a new session. And the ones that do come through might be people with pre-existing cookies. Am I making sense?\n\nAnyway, dev does not understand or know where to look, so I am on my own on this one.

So, you only need to run GA4 in the web container and you do NOT have to fire additional tags client-side.\n\nYou can do similar things with other third-party vendor tags as well: send the data they need to the server-side container, and then from there send it to them; negating need to run their tag on your web container.\n\nIt's not 100% there yet and there yet and there are some gotchas, but I do believe it will get better and better.",

The performance gain comes in if you are sending analytics data to multiple endpoints like GA, Facebook etc. You still send data to the server once, and the server distributes it to third parties.",

So if you follow that advice you get no page speed benefit from server-side at all, as it related to facebook at least.",
