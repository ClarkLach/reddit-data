You are trying to use a SAR to obtain copies of information about someone else. That's what I mean. The default position is that you do not have a right to obtain information about someone else, even if that person is your child.

Under the GDPR, you as a parent don't have a right of access to information held about your child - that right belongs to the child, not to you. You can make a request *on behalf of* your child, either if they consent to you doing so or if they do not have the capacity to do this themselves (which is not a mere question of how old they are - the council would need to determine this based on their knowledge of the child). I assume you do not have the child's consent and I obviously have no idea about your child's capacity but it's quite possible that neither apply in this scenario.\n\nI'd say it's more than appropriate for the council to check with the parent who provided the information. Especially in cases where the parents are separated - they could be opening themselves up to all kinds of legal issues by disclosing information about a child to the other parent without clearing it first. They have to act in the best interests of the child and it is not immediately clear that providing this info would be in line with this.\n\nThere is a separate right for parents to request access to their child's educational record, which I know very little about so I won't pretend to, but that might be a more appropriate mechanism. Ultimately this isn't what SARs are for.",

I'm not going to pull punches here, but tell it as it is, so please if you're angered by the answer just understand this is likely to be the LAs view. I've advised in my DPO role on many of these cases.\n\nFirstly, your child is old enough that they are likely to be competent to understand about their own data, so the LA would need to assess if they were competent, and if so, confirm with your child they are happy for the data to be released. In England, the test is whether the child understands the consequences - \"Gillick Competent\"\n\nIn situations like this there is always concern about parental coercion hence child's consent is very difficult. Unless it's very clear that both parents are not pushing the child to consent / not consent, it's hard to be sure of the child's wishes. This isn't made easier if parents are not cooperating with each other as here.\n\nSecondly, there is information about the other parent in the form, so they would either have to redact or get a consent on that.  That in itself is difficult - because by doing so they again increase the risk of parental coercion on the other side, plus their only legal route to releasing is if the other parent consents; redaction would be complicated too for the same reason.\n\nThirdly, you note police involvement - so the LA is likely concerned about safeguarding; whether the other parent is lying or not, they can't ignore it. They would have to determine if you are a risk to the child, and if the release of information would increase that risk.\n\nThe LA has to take into account the best interests of the child, particularly if consent cannot be clear. If they don't consider it in the best interests of the child, they can refuse to grant access to you. \n\nAnswering your direct questions.\n\n*Do I need the consent of the parent who submitted the application to see it? I just want the information relating to my child, not her.*\r  \n\r  \nAs noted, they would need to either redact her personal data or get her consent, so yes, because the form contained \n\n*Were the council correct in approaching her for consent?* \n\nYou asked for the complete form which included her details. So yes, to release her information; it wasn't needed to release the child's data, that would have been as noted above.\r  \n\r  \n*Can the council not just provide the application with my ex-partner's personal information redacted?*\n\nDepends on the risk they perceive and if the redaction would not increase the risk.\r  \n\r  \n*The SAR was for a single high school application for one child. Would this be considered complex and be justified in using the extended response time scale?*\n\nBecause of the parental separation, the potential safeguarding issues and the fact more than one person's data was on the form. They would have needed to consult the safeguarding team, consider if your child was competent and then consult them if they were, discuss if they could provide the form with the other parent's data redacted safely, and if not, get a consent to sharing from the other parent. There's no \"special department\" for doing SARs in a local authority - this all has to happen around the day job, so yes, extending is not unreasonable.",

Because of covid, the hospital was only sending out bills and refusing to take payment at the hospital.\n\nWe didn't get a bill, but we did just get a letter from a debt collector. Fair enough we'll pay it. But the problem is the information the debt collection company has.\n\nFirstly, they addressed it to me, rather than my wife. So I'm assuming the hospital didn't correctly record which parent was present.The debt collection agency also has my daughters name, as well as a summary of the reason for the visit \"Stomach cramps\".\n\nI'm not happy the hospital has given this company more information than they need to pursue the demand.

        "author": "ResidentHistory632",

        "selftext": "TL;DR - My questions are: is it not standard/required practice to verify an email address before sending out personal information, or even just adding it to a mailing list? What recourse do I have other than just marking them as spam?  I feel that when large organisations are sending out personal information they should be at least named and shamed but where?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nI hope it's appropriate to post here: I don't work in data management but I do know something about it - sometimes I feel like I know more than some data managers, but maybe I'm wrong...\n\nI have a firstname.surname gmail address and I go through phases where a big proportion of my emails are either from mailing lists I didn't sign up to, or worse, emails that contain someone else's private information.  Some of them seem like the person maybe didn't want to give their email and just made one up, but other times it seems like they actually didn't know their email address.\n\nThis is mainly a problem for me (not them) - I am currently getting multiple emails a day from different business schools about MBA's because someone apparently signed up with my email to one organisation (in the US) that has then distributed my email address far and wide. It seems my only recourse is to mark them all as spam until they stop arriving in my inbox, but there as so many it's like Whack-a-Mole.\n\nBut I am also receiving a fair few messages where other people's data is breached:\n\n\\- A major Italian car insurer sent me a quote that included the person's full name (same as mine), DoB, home address and car make, model and registration\n\n\\- A hotel chain was sending me booking confirmations which were basically telling me when a person who could afford €400-a-night hotels was away from home, and where that home was, in Paris\n\n\\- I had access to an Italian teenager's Pinterest because they had used my email address as login.  At least with that one I could change their username to \"StopUsingMyEmailAddress\" and it went away\n\n\\- A French government organisation repeatedly sent me statements of special educational needs for a child, despite me replying with increasingly lengthy versions of \"wrong address\".  Obviously in that case it could be a mis-type, but to keep sending them is surely a failure of GDPR\n\nSo my question is: beyond marking these as spam, do I have any real GDPR recourse when organisations fail to verify email addresses before distributing data, and is it worth reporting them so they are at least named and shamed?",

        "selftext": "As mentioned by DeepSeek itself:\n\n“DeepSeek's privacy practices involve extensive data collection, international data transfers, and significant security vulnerabilities, raising concerns among global regulators and security experts. Here's a detailed breakdown based on their policies, technical analyses, and regulatory findings:\n\n### 🔍 1. **Data Collection Practices**\nDeepSeek collects three main categories of data:  \n- **User-Provided Data**: Account details (email, phone number), chat inputs (\"Prompts\"), uploaded files, and feedback .  \n- **Automated Collection**: IP addresses, device identifiers, location (approximated via IP), cookies, and usage logs .  \n- **Third-Party Sources**: Data from social logins (e.g., Google/Apple) and security partners .  \n\n⚠️ **Controversies**:  \n- South Korea's PIPC found DeepSeek collected keystroke patterns (though later retracted) and transferred user prompts to Chinese servers without consent .  \n- Independent tests revealed collection of device names (e.g., \"John's iPhone\"), which could de-anonymize users .  \n\n### 🌐 2. **Data Usage and Sharing**\n- **Primary Uses**: Service delivery, model training, security monitoring, and compliance with legal requests .  \n- **Third-Party Sharing**:  \n  - **Volcengine** (ByteDance subsidiary): Received device info, network data, and user prompts until blocked in April 2025 .  \n  - **Service Providers**: Analytics (Google), security (Fengkong Cloud), and infrastructure partners .  \n  - **Corporate Group**: Entities in China/U.S. for R&D and storage .  \n\n*Table: Key Data Sharing Practices*  \n| **Recipient**       | **Data Shared**                          | **Purpose**                     | **Location** |  \n|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|  \n| Volcengine           | Device info, user prompts               | Security/UI optimization        | China        |  \n| Fengkong Cloud       | Device profiling, network data          | Fraud prevention                | China        |  \n| Google Analytics     | Usage logs, device details              | Analytics                       | U.S.         |  \n\n### 🛡️ 3. **Security Flaws**\nMultiple critical vulnerabilities were identified:  \n- **Unencrypted Transmissions**: User data sent in plain text (HTTP), disabling iOS security features like App Transport Security .  \n- **Weak Encryption**: Use of deprecated 3DES algorithm with hardcoded keys and reused initialization vectors .  \n- **Insecure Storage**: Cached databases exposed usernames, passwords, and encryption keys .  \n- **Device Fingerprinting**: Aggressive data collection (e.g., language settings, device models) enabling user tracking .  \n\n### ⚖️ 4. **Regulatory Compliance Issues**\n- **South Korea**: Banned new downloads (Feb 2025) for non-consensual data transfers to China/U.S. Recommended destroying illegally transferred data and appointing a local agent .  \n- **Italy**: Blocked DeepSeek for GDPR violations, citing insufficient transparency and data storage in China .  \n- **EU Concerns**: Ireland's DPC launched inquiries into data handling for EU users .  \n\n### 🕹️ 5. **User Controls and Rights**\n- **Opt-Out Options**: Users can delete chat history but cannot opt out of data collection for model training without disabling accounts .  \n- **Rights Requests**: Limited access/correction rights; data deletion may not extend to training datasets .  \n- **Age Verification**: Added after PIPC flagged child data risks, but effectiveness unclear .  \n\n### 💡 Key Concerns from Experts\n- **\"You Are the Product\"**: Free access trades for broad data exploitation, including commercial/personal inputs .  \n- **Chinese Legal Exposure**: Data stored in China subject to government access under national security laws .  \n- **Enterprise Risks**: U.S. military, NASA, and banks banned DeepSeek due to intellectual property theft risks .  \n\n### 🔚 Conclusion  \nWhile DeepSeek claims compliance in updated policies (e.g., adding Korean translations and opt-outs), its history of non-consensual data transfers, weak security, and storage under Chinese jurisdiction make it high-risk. Users handling sensitive data should avoid the platform, while enterprises must enforce strict bans. For casual use, limit inputs to non-personal content and regularly delete history.  \n\nFor regulatory documents or technical reports, refer to the [PIPC findings](https://www.pipc.go.kr)  or [NowSecure analysis](https://www.nowsecure.com) .”",

        "selftext": "(Let's assume I am talking about digital photos, where a person is easily recognizable and the main subject of the photo and hasn't given consent, and I am strictly talking about TAKING photos, not  what you do afterwards (like sharing)).  \nAs I understand it, GDPR prohibits \"processing\" of data, where \"processing\" is: *\"any operation or set of operations performed on personal data, whether done manually or by automated means\".* Taking a photograph with a digital camera is a form of processing, and is subject to GDPR regulation.  \nThe only case against that, is whether street photography as a hobby, is subject to the household exemption (the condition that states that the GDPR does not apply to the processing of personal data “by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity”). I think it is hard to classify taking photos of other people as a \"purely personal activity\", and it definitely doesn't have anything to do with a household activity. As I understand it, and as chat-GPT says (lol), it is a grey area and many factors need to be assessed in a court before it can be declared as a personal activity or not (like intent, frequency, scale and context).\n\nSo, to my ears, all these bold claims that in Europe, you are free to shoot anything in a public place, are somewhat wrong. (The \"anything\" part is definitely wrong, since in many countries you cannot take a picture of military establishments or the police, but this doesn't have anything to do with the GDPR, I know).\n\nIn Greece, the definition of street photography I provided is definitely illegal, since, apart from the GDPR, the civil law (article 57) clearly states that \"Anyone whose personality is unlawfully insulted has the right to demand that the insult be removed\", and according to the constitution's definition of personality and its insult, taking a photograph is illegal.\n\nI can see local laws making the regulations stricter, but not more lenient, overriding the GDPR (or can they?). Is there any case to be made that the GDPR doesn't prohibit taking photographs? Or at least that it isn't a grey area?",

For example, one of the following might be a violation:\n\n* there is no clear purpose and legal basis for this processing (compare Art 14 GDPR)\n* the data subjects were given insufficient notice (compare Art 13 GDPR)\n\nIn my opinion, there's a good chance that such photos aren't personal data. While individuals might arguably be identifiable, the photo would likely not *relate* to persons that appear incidentally in the background of a scene.\n\nIf GDPR applies, there might still be a legal basis that authorizes this processing. Obviously consent and so on wouldn't apply, but an Art 6(1)(f) legitimate interest is worth considering. A legitimate interest always requires a balancing test between the different rights and interests involved. One of the GDPR recitals mentions that the data subject's reasonable expectations would be an important factor here. I would argue that while a data subject can reasonably expect to not be the focus of a random photograph (e.g. someone walking up to you and taking a portrait), they would have to accept that they might appear in the background of a shot. However, this would require further investigation into the expectations in that specific country, as such expectations will also be expressed (and formed) by legislation on personality rights. You suggest that Greek personality rights are rather restrictive here. I'm from Germany where things would be a bit more flexible.",

                "body": "So I do street photography, simply claiming that GDPR prohibits photographers of working in public and photographing private individuals in public is just not accurate and here's why:\n\n(This post is aimed towards street photographers working for a company or self employed)\n\nGDPR doesn't affect your ability to take photographs of other people, if you can see something from where you are standing in a public space you may photograph it. This includes photographing from a public space into a private space such as a company.\n\nThere are exceptions to this, even if you are in public you may not photograph into someones private domicile or for example photograph someone taking a bath or shower in their own home through a window. \n\nYou also can not publicize images of a person that are of a compromising nature where this person can be identified.A photograph of a person where their face is identifiable is to be considered as personal data, normally you would need consent to publish this photo but your photographs are also your (the photographers) intellectual property.\n\nFurther governing whether you can or should publish a photograph is decided by your lawful basis for that use. \n\nThere are six available lawful bases for processing, they are the following:\n\n(a) Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.\n\n(b) Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.\n\n(c) Legal obligation: the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations).\n\n(d) Vital interests: the processing is necessary to protect someone’s life.\n\n(e) Public task: the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.\n\n(f) Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests. (This cannot apply if you are a public authority (government etc) processing data to perform your official tasks.)\n\nSo if you were a self employed photographer working on the street doing street photo for your company and snap a picture of someone walking down the street you would claim legitimate interests which is generally accepted and fine to use.This is generally the same all over the entire EU, links on lawful basis and legitimate interests are from the UK GDPR page and assumes that you are operating a business.\n\nFor private individuals engaging in street photography things are slightly different, in this case you would claim personal use instead of legitimate interests. Personal use means non-commercial use of the Media for display on personal websites and computers, or making image prints or video copies for personal use. The Media may not be used in any way whatsoever in which you charge money, collect fees, or receive any form of remuneration.\n\nPersonal use cases do not fall under GDPR as they are exempt and also falls under \"freedom of expression\".\n\nHaving said that I want to point out the following, both privacy (ie not having your photo taken) and freedom of expression (taking a photo of someone on the street) are fundamental rights covered by the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\n\"No right is absolute and, where two rights might potentially lead to a level of conflict, competent authorities have to ensure that a fair and equitable balance is reached.\"\n\nThis is where a compromise must be made, it is up to you as the photographer to use your images in a correct manner. If you receive a request to take a photo down it's simply easier to comply but as long as you use the photographs responsibly and do not portray the subject of the photo in a bad way then there's generally nothing to worry about.Sorry for the long post, it's a rather complicated subject with multiple laws playing into each other.\n\nSource1:  [\"What is considered personal data under the EU GDPR\"](https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/)\n\nSource2: [\"A guide to lawful basis\"](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/)\n\nSource3: [\"Legitimate interests\"](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/lawful-basis-for-processing/legitimate-interests/)\n\nSource4: [\"the European Convention on Human Rights\"](https://idpc.org.mt/idpc-publications/data-protection-and-street-photography/)",

I am not sure that the phrase  \"purely personal or household activity\" equals the phrase \"no connection to a professional or commercial activity\". As I understand it, a case can be made that a \"purely personal or household activity\" always has \"no connection to a professional or commercial activity\". But if an activity has \"no connection to a professional or commercial activity\" it doesn't necessarily mean that it is a \"purely personal or household activity\". For example, taking it upon yourself to teach a group of peoplehow to do something, but not accepting any form of payment or exposure (let's say your line of work is something completely different), is an activity that has \"no connection to a professional or commercial activity\" but it is not a \"purely personal or household activity\"",

I have never seen a case made for the prohibition of people appearing as background elements in a photo.\n\nI would argue that the act of taking a photo with a digital camera is \"processing\", since the sensor of the camera gathers light and so it captures the physical details (data) of the person (and if you are shooting JPEG, a compression and processing of the data is done either way.) If you are using a film camera, I think GDPR wouldn't apply, since that photo wouldn't form part of a filing system, and that is a main requirement for GDPR to be applicable.\n\n(Edit: how the heck do you quote text on Reddit, the > character isn't working for me on desktop, lol)",

Practically speaking legislative time constraints on SARs aren't fit for purpose when it comes to organisations with social care responsibilities - a person may be known from pre-birth, be involved with social care until they're 18 (or in some cases 21) as a child, and then both remain open to Social Care as an adult, and have their own children in the children's social care. The volume of records, reports and assessments which require reviewing and redacting can reach 1000's of pages which just isn't possible in one month. This demand might not be reflective of your own request, but I strongly suspect if it's SC that they'll have a substantial backlog due to this.\n\nYou can complain to your national DP authority, but I know certainly in the UK the ICO are unwilling to take firm action against LAs due to an acknowledgement they are severly underfunded, so the best you'd get is the ICO asking the LA to identify a plan to address their backlog, which won't necessarily help you. Realistically waiting is your only option, or, if there's specific information you're looking for, see if they can expedite a smaller, specific request and not a request for all information they hold.",

If that's the case then I can tell you that it's very likely they're right and it hasn't been assigned to an officer for review/redaction simply because the volume of requests these organisations receive is astronomical. \n\nI worked for a local authority for several years in the information governance team and we would receive between 500-800 requests a year. All of which were related to children's or adult social care. A quick case would be perhaps a few thousand pages, but the majority would be a lot more (sometimes up to 30,000 pages) and would take months upon months to complete.\n\nNow none of that is obviously relevant to you or your wife but I feel it's sometimes useful to give a bit of context in these cases because you're probably wondering what they're doing and if they're just sitting there doing nothing.\n\nMy advice would be to contact their data protection officer (contact details should be available on their website) and ask why it hasn't been assigned and when your wife can expect to receive the information. You can let them know if you intend on complaining to the ICO (regulator for data protection in the UK) and then follow through with that. In most cases, this does prompt organisations to assign the case and get started rather quickly.\n\nUnfortunately this is likely one of those cases where you'll just have to wait. In cases where I know the deadline cannot be met I will often say to those requesting information that I can release it in batches of a few hundred pages here and there to at least give them something to read through.

It is a voluntary contribution of €10 and each child puts their €10 into an envelope with their name, and then into a box. An envelope is chosen randomly and the child wins a voucher.\n\nI recently found out that each child's name and classroom is in a book and they are marked each month on where're or not they have paid. The chairperson said it has to be done because they need to know exactly where the money comes from if the association is audited. This feels wrong and weird to me. Is there a gdpr issue here?

That is only for signing up to information society services and is absolutely not a general age of consent for processing under UK GDPR. The key consideration is an assessment of competence - if the child can understand the issues and implications of their decision, then they can consent. They can also make the request themselves if they are judged to have capacity.\n\nHowever, another piece of legislation is pertinent to parents accessing their children’s educational records - the Pupil Information Regulations 2005 (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1437/contents). These require the school to make a child’s educational record available to the parent. \n\nSo this is not entirely a GDPR issue, although anything held outside of the formal educational record would have to be requested using a subject access request.",

Head of year emailed explaining what happened and saying 75 minute detention for his actions. Only according to her email his punishment was because he didn’t break up the fight and didn’t go to report it to a teacher. My son says a teacher was stood right there while it happened and only intervened once the argument became physical. \n\nI felt the punishment seemed a bit harsh so called to speak to head of year who then gave me a completely different version of events that were nothing at all like what she had emailed. When questioned she doubled down and suddenly decided my son was not an innocent bystander. I asked why she had given me 3 different stories at this point and asked to see CCTV, she denied so I said I’ll make a SAR and we can discuss the punishment once we are all in possession of the facts. \n\nSent the request in early today asking for the following:\n\n“As D is under 12 years of age (date of birth xx/xx/xx), I am making this request as per section 8.5 of your subject access request policy. \n\nThe data required is anything related to an incident that D was involved in on Friday 10th November 2023 which was reported via Synergy to his mother, M by Mrs G. The data should include any CCTV of D from that day from 60 minutes before the incident and up to 15 minutes after the incident, any statements made about Ds involvement in the incident and any file notes or similar made by any teachers involved in the incident or the investigation into the incident.”\n\nWhat are they likely to supply?

The SAR can't hurt, but lots of people make SARs looking for a smoking gun and are sorely disappointed - you may well find the same.\n\nTo be honest, I think a better approach if you want to find out what has happened here is to have a non-judgemental chat with your son. What does he say happened? Why does he think he was given detention? Speaking to him about it is far more likely to be in his interests than picking fights with the teachers.",

I told her my opinion and suddenly she changed her story and said that he was encouraging the fight and was also directly involved. I asked why this wasn’t mentioned in the email as those things seems pretty significant and would obviously change everything.

I again asked why I feel like I’m trying to get blood out of a stone here and why this wasn’t mentioned in the email or even in the previous version she had given me a minute before. She then mentioned CCTV and said my son pointed at the camera before the fight moved round the corner away from the camera. Only there’s another camera around the corner which picked up the rest of the altercation. \n\nBut my son mentioned the camera to me before I even told him it was on CCTV. He said that he had told his friend to leave it as there’s a camera there and he’ll get into trouble. He said as they walked away that’s when the racial slur was made and that’s when the fight kicked off again. \n\nI asked the head of year if there was audio and she said there wasn’t.

If they are not then the school should reply to you.  If they are, the school should reply to the child, or you can get the child to authorise the school to respond to you instead.

I’m not sure what the reason is for your request, but I would probably frame the argument as, the children don’t have capacity to exercise their own rights under law and so to protect their interests and verify that the school is complying with its obligations, and so it is necessary for you to do so on their behalf.

The challenge here is that, even if directly identifying information about your ex partner is redacted, it likely will still be apparent to you that the comments were made by her, and so it likely would still be considered personal data relating to her post-redaction, which means that it still can’t be disclosed in redacted form.  That may not be the case for all of that information, but really the school should be carrying out that analysis for all of the relevant informant and not just issuing a blanket refusal",

In practice, yes.\n\n“[Contracts of adhesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_form_contract#Contracts_of_adhesion)” like most terms of service are a “take it or leave it” document that create a large imbalance between the company/drafter and the consumer. Thus, many countries are going to have consumer protection laws that state you can't sneak anything surprising in there.\n\nThe GDPR concept of “consent” tries to avoid these problems. Consent is defined to be a “freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her” (Art 4(11) GDPR). And per Art 7(2), requests for consent must be clearly distinguishable from other matters – they cannot be hidden in a larger document.\n\nHere, the relevant aspect is that consent must be specific, informed, and unambiguous. If the data subject doesn't know what they consented to, then the consent wasn't sufficiently informed and is therefore *invalid*. If consent is sought for multiple distinct purposes, a “consent to all” button might also be too unspecific and too ambiguous for obtaining valid consent. The very first layer of a consent flow should directly summarize the purposes for which consent is sought.\n\nSo far, the theory.\n\nIn practice, consent management tools are not just used for cookie consent, but for a variety of processing purposes ranging from fairly harmless analytics cookies, to more invasive ad personalization, cross-site tracking, embedding third party content, and sometimes even international data transfers. These tools are so complex that there's almost certainly something hidden in there that user's wouldn't expect when clicking on “accept all”. So it's quite likely that a lot of sneaky things are being done here.\n\nFor further details on how GDPR consent is supposed to work, consider reading the [EDPB guidelines on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en). Section 3.3 of that document discusses when consent is sufficiently informed. If you're in the UK, the [ICO website includes guidelines on consent](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/what-is-valid-consent/).\n\nWhile cookies and similar technologies always require consent because the ePrivacy Directive (UK: PECR) says so, other processing activities might not need consent. For example, data processing is also legal if it is necessary for fulfilling a contract with the data subject. Notably, Facebook attempted the argument that per its terms of service (that Facebook had written itself), Facebook was contractually bound to deliver personalized ads to users. How convenient, since this avoided the need to ask users for consent. But this is not a good argument. As mentioned, terms of service cannot contain surprising terms. Immediately when the GDPR came into force, NOYB initiated complaints against this. Back in 2019, and presumably in reaction to the NOYB cases, the [EDPB published guidelines on the use of contractual necessity as a legal basis](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-22019-processing-personal-data-under-article-61b_en), pointing out that something doesn't just become necessary for providing a service just because a contract says so. But, according to a [NOYB update from 2021](https://noyb.eu/en/irish-dpc-greenlights-facebooks-gdpr-bypass), the Irish DPC doesn't feel like following the EDPB's guidelines :)",

If you 'Accept cookies', but the website assumes your consent for something else, that hasn't been explicitly stated, it will not be considered 'freely given' consent and could be contested for its legality.\n\nThe [EDPB guidelines](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf) also make a note of this:\n\n*“When data processing is done in pursuit of several purposes, the solution to comply with the conditions for valid consent lies in granularity, i.e. the separation of these purposes and obtaining consent for each purpose.”*",

But since you do *reasonably expect* that sub-16-year-olds might register, you should consider how you can comply.\n\nThe best move is not to play, i.e. to rely on other legal bases that consent. That might be difficult though if you're asking consent for device permissions, or when processing health data (special categories of data per Art 9).\n\nI would then suggest that you do ask during your signup flow whether the user is a child (depending on the exact relevant age limit, depends on national law), and then make “reasonable efforts” to verify that consent is given by the parent. If you persist consent-based user data on a backend, it should be marked as such so that the more through right to erasure can be satisfied. If your service is in child mode, it could make sense to disable some features, for example any social features.\n\nIf all of this is too much effort, then actively blocking children might be better – just mentioning this in the T&Cs is likely insufficient. However, you are generally free to contract with whom you want, and contractually excluding children would also be a very sensible component of a compliance strategy (also taking into account the child's ability to enter into the contract in the first place…).",

        "selftext": "I’m seeking advice on an online platform’s (over 190k members) data policy which contains multiple elements that raise GDPR concerns. \n\nIt states they may ‘request a copy of a government issued photo identification to verify your identity’ with such data ‘stored in our secure infrastructure.’ For minors it says ‘the member must self-certify that parental consent has been given,’ without describing any verification process the policy also mentions indefinite data retention: ‘Personal Information… will be retained for as long as necessary,’ but also indicates data might be kept indefinitely unless the user requests removal. \n\nMoreover, it says ‘the Board reserves the right to refuse requests if they impact the ability to serve the membership,’ raising questions on the balance between data subject rights and service continuity. The platform further collects and retains IP addresses, connection logs, and device identifiers ‘to enforce bans or restrictions and prevent duplicate accounts.’ Lastly, the policy is vague about the Data Protection Officer role, explaining no DPO has been appointed since they consider it unnecessary despite processing sensitive data at scale. How do these practices align with GDPR, particularly regarding storage limitation, lawful basis, transparency, children’s data consent, data subject rights, and the accountability principle?",

        "author": "Weekly-Nectarine",
        "id": "1m31whh",
        "selftext": "Afternoon all\n\nI am an officer in a sports club for an \"extreme sport\".  The sports club is subject to governance by a national governing body (NGB), which all club members (and constituting clubs) must belong to.  The NGB has just transitioned to a new web service for member management, including training and qualifications. \n\nOne of my club members is also a member of another club.  He is a qualified instructor and can award members qualifications through the new web service.  He brought to my attention that as an instructor, he has access to all personal information of members held on the web service, in every club in which he is a member.  This is information such as name and address, mobile phone number and email address.\n\nIt appears this is set by default for all instructors, and confirmed by other club members who are in my club.  The issue which gave rise to concern was that the club member who brought this to my attention noticed that he was provided with information of a member of another club who is a minor.  In his view, and in mine, this constitutes a GDPR breach and a safeguarding near miss.  There is no need for my club member to see the personal contact details of other club members, in our or any other club.  Should a training need arise for contact then that information should be shared with consent.  \n\nI submitted a formal notification to the NGB and have just received the response, copied below but anonymised because I don't want to publicly throw the NGB under the bus:\n\n>We have investigated your complaint and have looked into the issue thoroughly.  We can confirm that (instructor), according to our systems (new and old), was an active member of (other club), hence having access to the individual you identified as (minor).\n\n>(NGB) took legal advice on the data set up and this was cleared, many other NGBs use the same system set up via (provider). The data is set up as detailed in our GDPR policy and for the stated purposes. Contact and qualification data is only visible to officers and fully qualified instructors within their own club or clubs and does include U18 information if there are Juniors within the club.  \n\n> **Why Instructors Need Access to Member Info**\n\n> To deliver safe and effective training, instructors have a responsibility to follow (NGB) standards and make sure students are properly supported. To do this, they may need to:\n\n> 1.         Check that a student’s (NGB) membership is up to date\n\n> 2.         See what training a student has completed or still needs\n\n> 3.         Record progress or sign off lessons\n\n> 4.         Contact a student about their training using their name and email address\n\n> 5.         Have access to a student’s emergency contact details\n\n> Instructors are trusted volunteers in the club and play a key role—especially those who are (NGB) Nationally Qualified Instructors (NQIs). They’re expected to use this information responsibly, just like reading a student’s training record in the club file.\n\n> All data use is logged and should only be for (NGB) training purposes. Any misuse of this information would be taken very seriously.\n\n> However we have taken your comments on board and are looking at options to rectify concerns about instructors access to personal data, albeit lawfully.\n\n> Kind regards\n\n My concerns remain:\n\n* There is an encouragement, not a requirement, for instructors to have a valid DBS certificate.  MY club member is aware of the DBS process as his partner works in the care field, but does not hold a DBS certificate.  Most NGB instructors do not.  \n* Regardless of the advice the NGB has claimed to receive, there has been an unlawful disclosure of personal information of a third party because it was without their consent and there was no lawful need or requirement for my club member to see or use it.  \n* The service remains designed to provide open access to personal information by default, contrary to Article 25 of the 2018 Regulations.  The fact they have restricted my club member's access to his own club, this one time, and following my referral, does not address the systemic design failure in access to records for all NGB instructors, of which there are over 1,000.  \n* The above copy-pasted response (I am aware of a number of other individuals who have raised concerns about their own personal information being shared without without consent) claims that instructors are expected to behave responsibly with personal information, yet no data protection training is provided as part of the NGB instructor training regime.    \n* The issue of a minor's personal contact information being shared without their knowledge with someone who has no need to access it remains unresolved.  \n* The information being held doesn't actually include emergency contact details, which given the extreme sports nature of the organisation, is what would be of most use!\n\nI used to be a senior leader in a voluntary youth organisation which managed all young persons' information via a web service.  There were extremely rigid yet very sensible rules about who had access to what.  This broad level of access to childrens' records would have resulted in the a service shutdown until it was resolved.  \n\nMy question\n\nAm I way off base here?  Is the \"access by default\" for instructors, as big a deal as I think it is?  I am fairly confident a breach is still occurring and whilst I am neither the person in the organisation responsible for reporting, nor the subject of the complaint, I want to be fairly confident in where I stand before I take this to the ICO, as it is definitely going to cause relationship issues between my club and the NGB if I do.

        "title": "Analysis of Reddit's privacy policy update from Nov 15 2022",
        "author": "latkde",
        "id": "yw971c",
        "selftext": "Today, Reddit [updated its privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy). Unfortunately, Reddit did not explain the changes. I therefore used a text comparison tool to see what changed. Below, I summarize the impact, and do a detailed walk-through of all material changes.\n\nThe good: small improvements, less location tracking\n\nThe bad: web3\n\n# Summary\n\nThe policy retains is structure and overall content. The new version tends to be more actionable and makes it a bit easier to control privacy settings.\nI think these changes are generally an improvement (both in content and form), and suggest a maturing compliance culture at Reddit.\n\nA lot of the changes seem to be overdue cleanup, e.g. removing mention of Privacy Shield, and slightly reducing EEA-specific language. Some ad-related parts have been clarified, but without material changes. On mobile, opt-out from personalized ads is now clearly the responsibility of the app,\nnot of the operating system.\n\nNew categories of data collected:\n\n* optional account info, e.g. interests, gender, age, location\n* if doing blockchain/Web3 stuff with Reddit, blockchain addresses\n\nRemoved categories of data:\n\n* stopped collecting precise mobile device location (previously on opt-in basis, still collects IP-based location)\n* removed mention of Apple TrueDepth camera (???)\n\nReddit adds that account deletion may take 90 days to complete.\n\nInterestingly, the policy still doesn't consider the UK GDPR.\n\n# Details\n\n## Preamble\n\nThe preamble removes a mention of Reddit Gifts, and adds a high-level summary to reassure users.\n\nOld:\n\n> We want you to understand how and why Reddit, Inc. (\"Reddit,\" \"we\" or\n> \"us\") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our\n> sites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services\n> (collectively, the \"Services\") or when you otherwise interact with us\n> or receive a communication from us. This Privacy Policy applies to all\n> of our Services including Reddit Gifts, which maintains a [26]separate\n> privacy notice that incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference.\n\nNew:\n\n> At Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our\n> users to be the masters of their identity. In this privacy policy, we\n> want to help you understand how and why Reddit, Inc. (\"Reddit,\" \"we\" or\n> \"us\") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our\n> sites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services\n> (collectively, the \"Services\") or when you otherwise interact with us\n> or receive a communication from us.\n>\n> We collect minimal information that can be used to identify you by\n> default. If you want to just browse, you don't need an account. If you\n> want to create an account to participate in a subreddit, we don't\n> require you to give us your real name. We don't automatically track\n> your precise location. You can share as much or as little about\n> yourself as you want. You can create multiple accounts, update\n> information as you see fit, or ask us to delete your information.\n>\n> Any data we collect is used primarily to provide our services, which\n> are focused on allowing people to come together and form communities,\n> the vast majority of which are public. If you have questions about how\n> we use your data, you can always ask us for more information.\n\n## What information we collect\n\nrenamed from “What We Collect (and How it is Used and Shared)”\n\n### Account information\n\nMore details on different log-in methods.\nInformation on new optional info that can be provided:\ninterests, communities, gender, age, location.\n\nOld:\n\n> If you create a Reddit account, we may require you to provide a username and password. Your username is public, and it doesn't have to be related to your real name. You may also provide other account information, like an email address, bio, or profile picture. We also store your user account preferences and settings.\n\nNew:\n\n> You don't need an account to use Reddit. If you create a Reddit account, your account will have a username, which you provide or which was automatically generated. Your username is public, and it doesn't have to be related to your real name. You may need to provide a password, depending on whether you register using an email address or using a Single Sign-On (SSO) feature (such as Apple or Google).\n>\n> When you use Reddit, you may provide other optional information. We may ask you to select interests (e.g. history, nature, sports) to help create a home feed for you or to select communities (e.g. r/technology) to join. You may also provide other information, such as a bio, gender, age, location, or profile picture. This information is optional and may be removed at any time. We also store your user account preferences and settings. We may ask for such information prior to you creating a username or account to help improve your experience exploring Reddit.\n\n### Content you submit\n\nRemoved explicit mention of RPAN. Now talks generically about “audio and videos”.\n\n### Transactional information\n\nLists information that is collected if you purchase products or services.\nNew additions:\n\n> phone number\n\n> Reddit may collect public blockchain addresses, such as when you purchase an NFT or when a Reddit Vault is created.\n\n> Reddit […] does not store Reddit Vault private key information.\n\n### Information collected from cookies and similar technologies\n\nThis inserts two new purposes (highlighted in bold):\n\n> We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to **deliver and maintain our services and our site,** improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, **measure the effectiveness of advertising,** and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. See our Cookie Notice for more information about how Reddit uses cookies. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see \"Your Choices\" below.\n\n### Location information\n\nRemoves collection of accurate location on mobile devices, leaving only IP geolocation.\n\n> We may receive and process information about your location. ~~For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth).~~ We may ~~also~~ receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive ~~your~~ **an** approximate location ~~from other information about you, including~~ **based on** your IP address.\n\n### Other Information\n\nRemoved entire section. Old version:\n\n> We may also use information from Apple's TrueDepth camera to provide enhanced functionality in the Reddit app camera if you choose to use it. Information from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time -- we don't store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.\n\n### Information Collected from Other Sources\n\nSmall changes in phrasing how data sources are combined. Now directly explains how to configure this:\n\n> You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by visiting the Safety & Privacy section of the User Settings menu in your account, as described in the section titled \"Your Rights and Choices\" below.\n\n### Audience measurement\n\nRemoved explicit names of companies, and now characterizes them as “service providers”:\n\n> We partner with ~~audience measurement companies (including Quantcast and Nielsen)~~ **service providers that perform audience measurement** to learn demographic information about the population that uses Reddit.\n\n## How we use this information\n\nThe items were re-ordered. Two items were changed, separating ad-related purposes from normal processing:\n\nOld:\n\n> Measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services; and\n>\n> Personalize the Services, and provide and optimize advertisements, content, and features that match user profiles or interests.\n\nNew:\n\n> Personalize services, content, and features that match your activities, preferences, and settings. […]\n>\n> Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services;\n\n## Your Rights and Choices\n\nThis merges the previous sections “Your Choices” and “Your Rights”.\n\nThe preamble now mentions that Reddit distinguishes rights based on user location, and no longer mentions that an account may be a prerequisite for exercising these choices.\n\nOld:\n\n> You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Some of these choices are available to everyone who uses Reddit, while others only apply if you have a Reddit account.\n\nNew:\n\n> You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Depending on where you live, you may also have the right to request access to or ability to port, deletion/erasure of, or correction/rectification of, your personal information, to opt out of certain advertising practices, or to withdraw consent for processing where you have previously provided consent. Below we explain how to exercise each of these rights. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws.\n\n### Accessing and Changing Your Information\n\nsmall change in phrasing.\n\n> You can access **your information** and change **or correct** certain information through the Services.\n\n### Deleting Your Account\n\nNew version mentions how long deletion takes:\n\n> After you submit a request to delete your account, it may take up to 90 days for our purge script to complete deletion.\n\n### Opt Out of Targeted Advertising\n\nThis new section was moved out of “Controlling Advertising and Analytics”.\nThe new version no longer defers to privacy settings of mobile operating systems.\n\nOld:\n\n> We also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences your account settings in the Reddit app, or here if you use Reddit in a web browser. You can also use device-level settings to control personalized advertisements on Android (\"Reset advertising ID\" and \"Opt out of Ads Personalization\") and iOS (\"Limit Ad Tracking\") devices.\n\nNew:\n\n> You may opt out of us using information we collect from third parties, including advertising partners, to personalize the ads you see on Reddit. To do so, visit the Safety & Privacy section of the User Settings in your account here, if using desktop, and in your Account Settings if using the Reddit mobile app.\n\n### Controlling Location Information\n\nIn line to the changes with how location data is collected,\nthe following sentence was removed:\n\n> If you initially consent to our collection of more precise location information from your device, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.\n\n### Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests\n\nThis section no longer has a heading.\nRequests are no longer scoped to just GDPR and CCPA.\nMention of requests via authorized agents are moved to the CCPA section.\n\n> ~~Requests for a copy of the information Reddit has about your account--including EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") data subject access requests and California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") consumer information requests--can be submitted following the process described here.~~\n>\n> ~~All other data subject and consumer requests under data protection laws should be sent via email to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your Reddit account. Other inquiries related to your privacy rights can be submitted here.~~\n>\n> **If you have questions or are not able to submit a request to exercise your rights using the mechanisms above, you may also email us at to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your Reddit account, or submit them here.**\n>\n> Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified email address associated with your Reddit account.\n> **If we deny your request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us at redditdatarequests@reddit.com.**\n> ~~You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information.~~\n\n### International Data Transfers\n\nThe section was moved until after the EEA Users section.\n\nDrops the explicit mention of “Reddit, Inc.” as the target of data transfers.\n\nRemoves Privacy Shield explanation.\n\n### Additional Information for California Users\n\nChanged introduction paragraph slightly, but not materially.\n\nUpdates the referenced law:\n\n> The California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), **as amended,**\n\nAdds a category of data collected:\n\n> Your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail).\n\nUpdates the description of CCPA data subject rights. Moves and expands the explanation of requests via authorized agents.\nI won't show the full changes here.\n\nInteresting addition: Reddit now explicitly says it doesn't sell data:\n\n> Reddit does not \"sell\" or \"share\" personal information as those terms are defined under the CCPA. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information except to provide you the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA.\n\n### Children\n\nChanges the definition of children to work outside of Europe:\n\n> Additionally, if you are ~~in the EEA,~~ **located outside the United States,** […]\n\n### Changes to This Policy\n\nRemoved unrealistic requirement on users:\n\n> We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy\n> ~~whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us~~\n> **regularly** […]\n\n### Contact Us\n\nAdded an electronic contact method.\n\nReddit changed its Irish address.",

It does not have an UK representative as required by Art 27 UKGDPR.\n\nThe international data transfer section does discuss “users in the EEA, UK and/or Switzerland”, though.\n\nNothing here is atypical of a privacy notice for an internationally operating company, but it just shows that privacy laws other than California and EU are currently ignored or just handled on a “best effort” basis.\n\nWhile I think that the privacy policy update shows an increasing maturity of Reddit as a data controller, the drafting of the policy itself feels a bit sloppy (also combined with the various punctuation errors).",

They basically provide that either the ’user’ (the person using the ISS) or the subscriber (the person who has a contract with the internet service provider) must consent to the setting of cookies and similar technologies on the equipment (desktop computer, laptop, mobile device etc) being used. This is not quite the same as consenting to the processing of personal data in UK GDPR terms. **However, it remains the case that for consent to be valid the person providing it must understand what they are consenting to.** This means that you need to take proportionate measures, taking into account the risks inherent in technology being used, **to ensure that a child providing their own consent is competent to do so.** Further information on what this means in practice will be provided when our guidance on cookies is updated.\n\nIt has been argued that certain age verification schemes (like a check-box that says you're over a certain age) is not adequate for determining if someone is of the proper age.  So if you are confident with your age verification scheme then theoretically you can put the two together so long as its clear.  If the consent is for marketing, that option needs to turned off and based on what is happening with Meta, you are unlikely able to force targeted advertising (especially if it's children).",

While the Philippines do not have an adequate level of data protection, such a transfer can still be legal if there are sufficient safeguards. A mere data processing agreement (DPA) is not sufficient, it must also contain certain standard data protection clauses such as the UK IDTA.\n\nHowever, prior to doing such a transfer, it is necessary to conduct a transfer risk assessment (see [ICO guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/transfer-risk-assessments/)). A practical concern with international data transfers is that the foreign data importer might not actually be able to comply with the signed DPA, in particular if the destination country tends to ignore the rule of law. Another concern is that it might not be possible to hold the importer accountable, i.e. to sue them before an independent court if they breach the DPA contract.\n\nRegardless of whether a transfer occurs or not, your organization is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security and compliance of all processing activities. One of the measures explicitly suggested by the GDPR is pseudonymization, i.e. removing directly-identifying data. Perhaps the use of such security measures reduces the risks to data subjects to an equivalent level as if the pseudonymized data had been processed in the UK instead. However, that can be really tricky in practice. I think this would depend on what exactly this tech support does and has access to.",

                "body": "**Claim 1: access by staff in the same org but not in another country isn't a transfer.**\n\nThis is mostly correct.\n\nThere is the general understanding that for a transfer to occur, there must be distinct entities as data exporter and data importer, for example a company and a contractor, or two corporations that are part of the same group of companies (e.g. WhatsApp LLC and WhatsApp Ireland Limited).\n\nIf we have a company that has direct employees in two countries, there is no separate data importer and therefore no transfer. Employees just act on behalf of their employer. The employees are not controllers, processors, third parties, or recipients.\n\nThe [ICO writes](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers/), and I think this view is also shared by the EDPB, that:\n\n> The transfer rules do not apply where the receiver is an employee of the sender, or the sender and receiver are part of the same legal entity, such as a company.\n\nThis is not carte blanche for the data controller to ignore transfer risks though. There is still the general obligation to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. If a controller wouldn't be able to transfer data to a certain country, it is likely that they wouldn't be able to have employees work from that country either. Similarly, a controller might find it necessary to lock down, erase, or destroy electronic devices before or after international travel, if the employee could be forced to hand over the device to authorities (e.g. at a border check).\n\nAlso, at least one party must be in a non-UK/non-EEA country. If both the exporter and importer are in the same non-UK/non-EEA country, any sharing or disclosure between them would still be an international transfer, even though no borders were crossed.\n\n**Claim 2: incidental exposure isn't a transfer.**\n\nProbably wrong.\n\nThe GDPR does not define the concept of a “transfer” in sufficient detail to make a well-founded argument. However, ICO and EDPB guidance tends to indicate that making access to data available counts as a transfer, even if no persistent copies are made. This is in line with the GDPR's broad definition of “processing”.\n\nE.g. the ICO writes in that same guidance:\n\n> Making data accessible to a separate controller or processor located outside the UK will result in a restricted transfer. This could be by allowing remote access to your systems or by putting personal data on to a website. The restricted transfer takes place when someone (who is part of a legally distinct controller or processor) outside the UK accesses that personal data on your systems or via the website.\n>\n> Example\n>\n> > A UK business enters into an IT support contract with an Indian company. The data remains on the UK business’s servers (in the UK), but is accessed by the IT support team located in India.\n> >\n> > Access to this data by the Indian company is a restricted transfer.\n\nSimilarly, but less explicitly, the [EDPB mentioned in their Schrems II FAQ](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/other/frequently-asked-questions-judgment-court-justice-european-union_en):\n\n> even providing access to data from a third country, for instance for administration purposes, also amounts to a transfer\n\nThere are two nuances though:\n\n* Transit is not transfer. The mere fact that a network connection was routed through a country does not imply that data was transferred to that country. The linked ICO guidance makes this explicit. However, general obligation to implement TOMs applies, and data in transit should almost always be encrypted (see also the [EDPB recommendations on supplemental measures, use case 3](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en))\n\n* The GDPR mentions that a transfer occurs when the data is “intended for processing after transfer to a third country”. This introduces an element of intentionality, so that there might be an argument that unintentional/accidental disclosure wouldn't be a transfer. But personally, I find that argument highly unconvincing. Such accidental disclosure would still be violation of the more fundamental Art 5(1)(f) principle of integrity and confidentiality.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm not a lawyer, I'm just trying to summarize my current understanding of the law and relevant guidance, please refer to authoritative guidance instead.",

If it’s a small business then payroll/HR/On-boarding may be essentially the same person or department which has legitimate access to all the data. Therefore, there is no security concern that the department or person has access to all the described data. \n\nIf it’s a larger organisation with separate teams, then do payroll team members need legitimate access to identity documents to perform their jobs role? If the answer is no, then a breach has likely occurred because the data has been accessed by an unauthorised person. \n\nThe second question is if the use of your identify document as a means to gain access to your bank details is in non-compliance with Article 5(1)(b) - the requirement to use data explicitly for what it was collected for and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with that purpose.\n\nIMO the use of your identity documents to get your bank details was in non-compliance with 5(1)(b). When you provided your bank statement, it seems clear to me that this was being done as an identity control. You would not have had a reasonably expectation that the organisation would use this for some other purpose beyond proving your identity.\n\nI think this seems like a case of a person thinking they are being pragmatic by using the banks details on your identity documents, but unfortunately this seems to have caused issued for you.

This group has been operating for about 6 years and was administered by a local parent support charity. That charity has recently merged with a larger charity and this new organisation has now taken over the running of the Facebook group.\n\nPreviously the group had the rule of no organisations or professionals being able to join so that parents felt safe to talk freely about issues they may be having with professionals from the medical field, schools, and the local authority. It is well known that professionals have infiltrated parent support groups in the past and used things said by parents there against them in meetings and even legal tribunals. This was in the rules of the page and the admin closely vetted new members and approved all posts.\n\nThe new charity has now taken over the group (and got access to it 3.8k membership) and has declared that they are now allowing professionals and organisations into the group, and if we are worried about that we are to go through five or six years of posts and remove all postings and comments ourselves. In my case, this is a nearly impossible task, as I've commented or posted almost daily for five years. They have been asked to start a new group where members can agree to the new rules and then delete or archive the old group but they are refusing to do that.\n\nAs a large and well-known local charity are they in any way bound by GDPR rules to remove our data or ask for permission for our old posts and comments to be viewable by organisations and professionals when we joined the group under the old rules it being a parent-only space? Is there anything we can do to have them close the group or remove our data? \n\nMany thanks",

        "author": "GermanKiwi",
        "id": "l23gnj",
        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm looking for some advice or opinions regarding privacy and the GDPR. I apologise for the length of this query, as I need to explain the background. I manage the website of a church in Germany, and I'm the de facto privacy officer for the church. During the corona lockdown, the government allows churches to continue holding Sunday services, so long as the churches enforce certain health measures (face masks, social distancing, no singing, etc), which my church is strictly adhering to.\n\nThe German state that we're located in also has its own statewide \"Corona Ordinance\" law, which stipulates the following:\n\n* People attending church services must register beforehand by providing their contact details to the church - specifically their name, address and phone - meaning that the church must collect this data from the attendees.\n* This personal data is collected \"solely for the purpose of providing information to the Health Department\" in the event of a COVID infection - ie. for \"tracing possible routes of infection\". The data is only given to the Health Department if they request it.\n* Otherwise \"the data shall be saved for a period of four weeks and then deleted.\"\n* \"Any other use \\[of the data\\] is not permitted.\"\n\n(The texts above which are inside \"quotation marks\" are direct quotes from the Corona Ordinance).\n\nIn addition to the above stipulations from the Corona Ordinance, we must also, of course, comply with the GDPR with regards to the processing of this personal data. Our lawful basis for processing the data, per Article 6 of the GDPR, is obviously paragraph (1)(c) - \"compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.\" Which means we don't need to use consent or legitimate interest as our basis.\n\nMy church wants to use our existing church management software to handle the registration process for collecting the contact details of attendees each week. This software comes from a third-party software vendor based in the USA, and it includes an event management feature that we could use to allow attendees to register online for each Sunday's service (similar to buying tickets to an event).\n\nThe software provides its own web portal for us to use, hosted on the vendor's server (ie. not part of our own church website). Attendees would go to the portal, select the upcoming Sunday service, click a Register button, and enter their name/email/phone into a form, after which they'd receive a confirmation email.\n\nHowever: the software actually creates a permanent user profile in its database for each person who registers - basically, an account. This is because the primary focus of the software is managing church membership and church groups, therefore the software's features are built around the concept of member/user \"profiles\", which are like accounts that people can sign into. The event management tool is more of a side-feature that they've tacked onto the software.\n\nThe problem is this: when attendees fill out the form to register for an \"event\" (Sunday service), there is nothing written on the portal page to inform them that a permanent user profile is being created in the backend using the data they're providing. So they think they're just providing their details for the upcoming Sunday service, similar to writing their details on a sheet of paper. They have the expectation that their details will be stored for 4 weeks then destroyed. The web portal neither informs them, nor asks for consent (eg. via a checkbox), to create a user profile/account for them.\n\nWe - the software admins - have the ability to delete the user profiles if we want. So each week, we could delete the profiles of the attendees who haven't registered for a service in the past four weeks, thereby ensuring we don't keep their data for more than four weeks. However, that would not apply to attendees who come to the services regularly - their profiles would remain in the system, because they would have used their profile to attend a service within the previous four weeks.\n\nThis raises some privacy concerns for me, which is where I hope to get some advice:\n\n**Question 1)**\n\nIs it legal, under the GDPR, for the software to create a permanent user profile for the attendees without informing them, and/or without asking their consent?\n\nI don't believe we can use the lawful basis of \"legal obligation\" - Article 6(1)(c) - for this, as the Corona Ordinance does not require us to create a user profile for church attendees. It only requires us to collect name/address/phone details on a per-church-service basis. I'm also not convinced we could - or should - use the basis of \"legitimate interest\" here, either. Given that attendees probably don't have a reasonable expectation of having a profile created for them, and given that it's not a \"must\" for us to create such profiles in order to comply with the requirements of the Corona Ordinance, it seems to me that \"legitimate interest\" can't be used, and instead the lawful basis of \"consent\" must be used. Would you agree?\n\nIt's also worth noting that some of the user profiles will belong to underage children, as parents will enter the details of their children during the registration process. Again, the parents are neither informed, or asked for consent, to have a profile created for their children.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the software also tracks each attendee's IP address, which the GDPR considers to be personal data. There is no option to opt out of this tracking.\n\n**Question 2)**\n\nOn a related note, would the creation of the user profile violate the requirements of the Corona Ordinance itself? Specifically with regards to the stipulation that \"any other use \\[of the data\\] is not permitted\", beyond the stated purpose of collecting the data for \"tracing possible routes of infection\". In other words, would the creation of a user profile constitute an additional \"use\" of the data, beyond the stated purpose, which would violate the requirement that \"any other use\" is not allowed?\n\n**Question 3)**\n\nAttendees who attend Sunday services regularly every week won't have their profiles manually deleted by us - because we'd only be able to delete the profiles which had been inactive for the previous 4 weeks. So those regularly-used profiles would remain in the system indefinitely. Would this violate the requirement of the Corona Ordinance that \"the data shall be saved for a period of four weeks and then deleted\"?\n\n**Question 4)**\n\nIs it allowed for the software to track attendee IP addresses without consent, ie. without providing any way to opt out? The software vendor's portal has its own Privacy Policy where they explain that they track IP Addresses, and I think they claim the basis of \"legitimate interest\" for this. However, they are the data processor, not the data controller, which should mean that it's not up to them to make that decision – rather, it should be up to us, as the data controller, to decide whether IPs are tracked, and whether it's optional, and what lawful basis we use for it - right?\n\nSorry for the long post, and I appreciate those who've made it this far and can provide me with any advice or opinions on these questions - especially if supported by references or evidence of some kind, which I could use to make a case for or against this software.",

                "body": "Question 1) With regard to the data in the user profile that you would be collecting anyway: you don't need a seperate legal basis to hold it in a particular format. Your legal basis for holding names, addresses and phone numbers is the legal obligation under the Corona Ordinance. The fact that you hold two copies of that data due to the way your computer system works is irrelevant.\n\nHowever, you've also advised the system collects IP addresses and that this can't be turned off. Do you know why that is? For example, is there any important website security-related reason why this information is collected? If so, then that my inform the legal basis for storing this data. If not, then strictly speaking, you should not store it. \n\nWhether or not you want to take the risk that comes with storing a user's IP address unnecessarily is up to you. I don't know what GDPR enforcement is like in Germany (I assume it's more thourough than here in the UK - it would be difficult not to be) but I find it hard to imagine a regulator aggressively pursuing you for something like this if you were otherwise doing everything possible to handle data appropriately.\n\nQuestion 2) This is a question about German law moreso than GDPR. However, it doesn't really sound to me like you are using this data for any other purposes. Again, having two copies of it doesn't seem to be relevant. However, Germany and the UK have different legal systems, so I might be missing something vital in this interpretation.\n\nQuestion 3) If I attended on Sunday 13th December and then every Sunday after that, would you still (today, 21st January) have a record of my attendance on 13th December? Or would you only hold my name, address, phone number and records of services I attended in the past four weeks? If the former, then it sounds like you might be holding some data for longer than permitted under the Ordinance. However, again, this is a question for German law.\n\nQuestion 4) Yes, you're right, it should be up to you - not your data processor - to determine the legal basis for collecting attendee's IP addresses. If you do not have a legal basis to do this, you shouldn't collect it - however, see what I wrote above on this topic.",

                "body": "I think your analysis is generally correct so far, so there are only some very few details to fill in. In particular, you are correct that this online solutions seems to have a multitude of compliance challenges. I doubt that you'll ever get this system to perform in an entirely GDPR-compliant way. However, it may be better to have a flawed system than no system at all. Though if it weren't for the prior registration mandate, a paper-based system would be much easier to implement and to do compliantly.\n\nOne aspect you've overlooked is that your software seems to be hosted in the US. Since the Privacy Shield was ruled to be invalid last year, international transfers of personal data into the US are way more difficult to do in a compliant manner. Ideally you would be able to implement supplemental protections, but that's effectively impossible when using SaaS. In this case, the personal data allows inferences about the data subject's religious beliefs and is therefore particularly sensitive.\n\nOn to your questions.\n\n## Q1, Q2: Can the data that was collected for a legal obligation under some Corona ordinance be also used to create a permanent user profile, without information/consent?\n\nWhatever you do, you must provide transparent information. If you collect data from a data subject, you must inform them about the purposes of processing irrespective of the legal basis you're using, see Art 13(1)(c).\n\nProcessing of personal data for a different purpose than it was collected for is permissible in some cases, see Art 6(4) GDPR. However, since your legal basis for collection is a legal obligation, I don't think this section applies. Furthermore, the law in question contains a purpose limitation – you're not allowed to use the data for any other purpose.\n\nIs creating a profile strictly necessary? Definitely not. And whereas the law intends to gather the contact details of persons at an event, your profiles would also make it possible to see which events were visited by a particular person.\n\nSo, I think you really should not be creating such profiles.\n\n## Q3: Would it violate the Corona ordinance to keep profiles active for more than 4 weeks if the data subject has visited more recent events?\n\nYou're required to store the record “event, name, address, phone” and to delete this record after 4 weeks. You are proposing this as a profile containing name/address/phone, which is associated with one or more events.\n\nI think this could be compliant, provided that the association between users and events is severed for all events more than 4 weeks old. So if you can delete an event from a profile, and delete profiles that have no further events left, that could be compliant (except for the issue of combining multiple event records into a profile, which might not be allowed).\n\nWhat's not OK under this legal basis is if you're associating visitors with events that are more than 4 weeks old.\n\n## Q4: Is it permissible to collect IP addresses without consent, because the software used does not allow this to be switched off?\n\nUnder GDPR, any processing of personal data needs a purpose. Processing without a purpose is not permissible. Depending on the purpose, you might be able to find a legal basis such as an “legitimate interest”.\n\nWhere a processing activity is carried out by a data processor, the controller often determines the high-level means and purposes, and the processor fills in non-essential details. For example, the controller might find that a service needs to use appropriate security measures. The processor might implement this by keeping IP logs for such security purposes, for a limited time.\n\nIn the case of IP addresses, you must also consider that these also are traffic data in the sense of the ePrivacy directive (ePD). The German government considers the ePD to be immediately effective law, so that more lax provisions in the TMG are superseded. Under ePD, traffic data can only be used for the purpose of a “transmission” (e.g. for responding to a HTTP request), or in anonymized form, for billing purposes, or when the user has given consent. However, it is generally accepted that some security measures are necessary for the safe provisioning of a service, and could be covered by a legitimate interest.\n\n## What should you do?\n\nYou're trying to make the best of a bad situation. I don't think that this online solution would be entirely GDPR-compliant, but it might contribute to a larger strategy.\n\nOne approach to consider would be to take registrations primarily by phone,\nbut offer the website as a self-service mechanism. Users can freely choose between these mechanisms, so you could ask for consent. However, consent must be informed. It is necessary but not sufficient to write a privacy policy that provides full information in line with Art 13. You should also directly summarize key information at the point where you ask for consent, e.g. above the form for creating a new account. In particular, users should be clearly informed that the online registration is provided as a convenience and is not mandatory to use (link the phone number as an alternative), that the data will be kept in a profile until the account is closed, and that they can read the full privacy policy. Such a “layered approach” is suggested by the [EDPB/WP29 guidelines on transparency (document WP260)](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=622227)\n\nOr you could use a software tool that doesn't suffer the problems of this event management plugin. Setting up such a tool might require far less time than bringing the existing tool into compliance to a sufficient degree, but that's your call.\n\nPlease note that this comment presents my opinion, but just works from the snippets you've provided and definitely cannot replace legal advice.",

The website uses Mixpanel for analytics and redirects to [Tally.so](http://Tally.so) to collect email addresses for a waiting list. I’m not very familiar with GDPR regulations and would like to avoid common compliance mistakes without spending a lot on compliance tools or diving too deep into legal studies.\n\n\n\n**Here’s what I’ve gathered so far (please correct me if I'm wrong):**  \n  \n- Use free tools like Cookiebot if your site uses cookies.\n\n- You need an imprint that includes your full name and current address.\n\n\n\n**That said, I still have a few questions specific to my situation:**  \n  \n- If I use a third-party service to collect and store email addresses (for something like a waiting list), is that allowed under GDPR? (I’m referring to [tally.so](http://tally.so), which claims to be hosted in the EU)\n\n- What about Terms & Privacy? Do I need to include how the data is stored, even if the email addresses are stored on a domain that isn’t mine (like tally.so), but I still have access to the data?\n\n- Does my website need to be hosted in the EU, or is it okay to use hosting providers based in the US?\n\n- What about analytics tools? Are there any common mistakes when using Mixpanel, for example?\n\n\n\nAny advice or resources (a checklist or sth. would be nice) would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

You can check out their privacy policy or contact them directly to see if they are GDPR-compliant. \n\nAs websites mostly use cookies, it's really important to ask visitors for permission before using them. Use cookie banners to achieve this. Also, we need to block third-party cookies by default until we get the green light (consent) from our visitors. This way, we make sure we're following the rules set out in the GDPR and EU cookie law.\n\nHonestly, it is a relief that there are SAAS options that can help us in a few quick steps. Go for simpler options like CookieYes known for its easy integration and technical support.\n\nFinally, Yes, you must provide a privacy policy that discloses the categories of personal data, the purposes for which they will be used, etc. If you share personal data like email addresses with third parties, that should also be included in the policy. \n\nYou can host your website from anywhere if you have taken steps to become GDPR-compliant.

The holding company has nominated it's own regional DPO whom I occasionally meet.\n\nThe school doesn't know how to approach data protection and privacy and is pretty much guessing its way in ad hoc approach to data protection and privacy. Students (about 1500) and parents are from more than 40 countries, paying about $40k per kid per year.\n\nIn order to track compliance, I've recommended the installation of an ISMS. The IT department (run by the holding company) are using nist CSF but don't have a Lead Implementor, and didn't even know what one is. I've recommended that they run the ISMS as they have the tech skills. The school deputy head wants me to remain as internal privacy and compliance consultant, which I'm happy to do. \n\nI recommended several different ISMS. The DPO is fighting against the proposal, which I find bizarre. \n\nCan anyone provide a balanced view of why an international school should or should not install and manage an ISMS?

It exists in one locality, and is governed by one set of laws; the attendees are governed by the same set of laws because they're within commuting distance.  It doesn't have a complex product or data products.  It doesn't sell data.  It should have relatively few processors, mostly revolving around one of the 2 big office suites, and that bought from either Google or Microsoft's owned subsidiaries in the EU, plus school management software.  Because of the concerns created by the personal data of underage students, both the school management software and the office suites tend (from what I've seen) to be more locked down in school deployments.\n\nA school is basically a fee for attendance business.  They do some grading and give some tests, then retain documentation (perhaps for life) to attest to performance.  And that's about it?\n\nNow if they're exporting student data to the British hq, I could imagine the need for ISO implementations.  But for basic policies, a full ISMS seems heavy.\n\nedit: though you're advocating for it, so perhaps you could explain why you think it's a good idea.\n\nedit2: business complexities that drive gdpr complexities are things like selling data (hopefully never); data retention policies (probably delete everything but the report cards shortly after a student leaves); international data transfers (hopefully none, or limited to office suites); employment relations (straightforward if you just view it as a medium sized business in one location that hires 200-ish people and performs background checks); outbound marketing (done to parents, not the attendees); trade shows and website conversion tracking (ditto, and hopefully virtually no tracking of students except for security); etc.",

When you talk about ISMS right from the start, people will typically freak out because of the perceived large scope, believe it's going to be disruptive in nature, or see a huge expenditure in dollars.\n\nOne of your first steps with any security or privacy program is performing a data inventory.  You need to know what personal data is collected, where/who its being stored with, who has access, what purpose, and how long you keep it.  Any DPO worth their salt would love to have this because it will help identify risks to the organization and from there figure out what critical areas they need to address.  In the end you'll end up implementing an ISMS, but you don't necessarily need to spend a lot up front.\n\nAlso talk with the DPO and figure out what are their priorities and revise your proposal/project to address them, and hopefully you can put them at the front of the queue.  If ISMS itself is too daunting of a word, you may just have to position things as smaller projects;  propose to do things manually at first so people can see value and the complexity of doing things by hand to justify purchasing technology in the future.",

We know (not because the school has told us) they use GSuite, an app for maths, another one for writing/learning... you name it, all with the kid's 1st/lastname id, beginning 5yo. After months of unfruitful back-and-forths (we began with informal questions and finished with a meeting with the principal, with no satisfactory response), **we filed a right of access request** to our school and just got the response.\n\nTo our utter surprise, it just mentions a couple official and government recipients in section (c) (recipients or categories of recipients): none of the edtech app that we know they use. A lawyer we know explained that this might be correct: he was in doubt as to whether processors are technically considered \"recipients\", and thus that it might be that **the school has no obligation to inform about the processors they have contracts with** (which I think goes directly against the principle of transparency, but... I know nothing).\n\nAny light on this? Do controllers (the school) have to inform about processors (the apps)? If Art.15 requests do not include this, **how can we know about where our kids' school is spreading their data**?",

It specifically addresses whether a controller must provide information on the recipients or categories of recipients in response to an access requests pursuant to art. 15 GDPR. Advocate General Pitruzzella's opinion (paraphrased):\n\n>*The data subject's right of access must necessarily extend, upon request, to an identification of the specific recipients to whom their personal data are disclosed. Only where it is materially impossible to identify the specific recipients, or where controller demonstrates that data subject's requests are manifestly unfounded/excessive, may that right of access be limited to indication of recipients categories.*\n\nOr in other words, as a principle rule, a controller must provide information about the specific recipients. Moreover, it is for the data subject to choose, and not for the controller.\n\nI fully expect for the Court to adopt this opinion.\n\nThis fully translates to this case where the information on specific recipients is necessary to verify the lawfulness of the processing.\n\nIn short (for u/niaronemeh): you have the right to know the specific recipients, you can reference the A-G's opinion, although if you are in the UK it will somewhat be less authoritative (since UK left the EU), but nonetheless relevant. Obviously the court itself still needs to rule on this, but you can fully except the court of adopt the opinion.",

The GDPR recognizes that you can use personal data for establishing legal claims. The GDPR is not intended to deprive you from the ability to hold on to evidence that you need. So a better question would be whether making that photograph was necessary to defend your or your child's rights, or whether other proof such as witness statements would have been sufficient.\n\nWhile the principal's suggestion that this photograph was illegal is likely intended to bully you into silence, it is not entirely without merit (though the GDPR argument is pretty weak).

It surprises me (or maybe it doesn’t) that they as an employee with access to such wouldn’t know this from their training, or that the employer wouldn’t make this very clear to them.",
