Personally, I'm quite satisfied with the combination of Firefox + uBlock Origin + enabling the \"Annoyances – Cookie Banners\" lists, but I'm also OK with websites that don't always work correctly. This also works on mobile devices.\n\n\nWhat attempts are there to address the cookie consent problem?\n\n\n\nBrowser makers have started to support some degree of tracking without legally needing consent. E.g. Google's Privacy Sandbox initiatives, or Mozilla's/Meta's Privacy Preserving Attribution. But there are debates about whether that's lawful. Also, websites using these features will still ask for consent because they'd like to do *more* tracking.\n\n\nGermany has passed a law that allows the establishment of central consent management services. Consent once, and participating websites don't have to ask themselves. But no such service actually exists. And even if it did exist, most websites wouldn't participate, and even if they'd participate, they would still show a consent banner to ask for additional consents.\n\n\nSimilarly, browser-based consent management wouldn't work in practice. Unless you say \"yes\" to everything, websites will look for every possible way to coerce you into consenting. A broad \"consent to all\" is not legally possible, because the GDPR requires that consent is informed and specific, that you know what you're getting yourself into. But this is all hypothetical, as no browser vendor is interested in the liability of running such a system.\n\n\nRoughly one decade ago, there was an \"ePrivacy Regulation\" proposal that would have greatly reduced the need for cookie consent, by allowing opt-out approaches for low-risk purposes. (While still needing consent for things like cross-site tracking that's the foundation of online behavioural advertising). However, this law was never passed. In particular, parts of the advertising industry like Google lobbied *hard* against the proposed rules.\n\n\nSo in summary, everyone knows it's a problem, but websites + ad networks have no interest in change, browsers have been captured by advertisers, EU level legislators don't feel this is urgent enough, and national legislators are unable to make meaningful changes.",

Most analytics involve some kind of client ID, e.g. in order to stitch visits into sessions. Generating or storing this ID will typically fall under the ePrivacy consent requirement, but since this ID also identifies a user, these analytics will also fall under the GDPR.\n\nIf there is some kind of processing activity that doesn't touch on ePrivacy but only involves GDPR, then things are a lot more flexible. You would no longer be forced to rely on consent, and could e.g. perform a legitimate interest balancing test.\n\nMy personal belief (but others disagree) is that client-side analytics will always require consent. The only viable path towards collecting consent-free statistics is to look at server side data that you get anyways, for example classic logfile analytics.\n\nSome EU data protection agencies tolerate basic first-party analytics even without consent.

(Article 7(1) GDPR)*\n\nWhat is being introduced here is the need for so called consent records. At minimum, your cmp needs to provide a way for you to record: what banner/version was shown; choice the user made (agree, reject); when they made the choice (timestamp); possibly from what IP or device/browser.\n\nOther \"custom\" interactions are a bit on the fence like tracking clicks on the close icon (if you have one) and clicking outside the banner (if it closes upon outside). As others have mentioned here - as long as there is no PII you should be okay. \n\nAs for the low opt-in rate - you can play around with your banner design (although gdpr requires the same color for both accept and reject buttons), positioning (as others have mentioned), and banner text. Sometimes a more light hearted approach (if it fits your brand image) works better than the scary huge privacy notice. Also - make sure you are checking on which device you have the most traffic from. Your banner on Mobile needs to be visible and easy to interact with, no blocking by other elements. Usually it likes to break on different screen sizes/browsers so test it out many, many, maaaany times. \n\nAlso undermined - banner language. You probably know this but look over your main traffic geos - if it's possible on your end, show the appropriate language for your main sources to help opt-in.\n\nImplied consent is something a bit different - it means you are treating a certain banner event apart from Accept as consent and you are enabling tracking for the user which does not seem to be the case.",

And if you don't use cookies, PECR is probably not relevant, however: the whole GDPR is about active consent and clarity as to what your PII is being used for and how it's collected. \n\nSo I think that this is an interesting legal question and potentially moral a moral one:\n\nAs far as I see it, \"Consent Mode\" is a reaction to GDPR, enshrined into UK law in the Data Protection Act of 2018, and Cookie laws (PECR). So to say that cookie-less tracking is a solution that circumvents Consent Mode, is a bit disingenious. Tantamount to saying: Google put up restrictions that make it a tad more challenging to ignore the GDPR, so let's use cookie-less tracking to ignrore the law...\n\nDon't get me wrong here, I am not calling the supplier out. I'm primarily interested in where you stand on the issue I describe? And more widely, why do you think this industry is so keen on flaunting the spirit of the law, if not the law itself? - I practically never see a website that has properly addressed GDPR and PECR in the way the regulation was written or what it was intended to do.\n\nThe Rule of Law should be important to all of us. Ignoring the law just furthers lawlessness. And lawlessness makes universal lawlessness a requirement. Businesses that flaunt to the law have an advantage over businesses that adhere to it, obviously. So it's not fair, you aren't competing if you don't break the law.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nAddendum:\nThank you for the replies. I too believe that if the data that's collected is personally identifiable, and since transaction logging is part of this, it almost certainly is PII.\nSo you circumvent cookies and require no consent here, but you still need consent for the tracking.\n\nI would like to know what everyone's opinions are regarding the digital industry's willingness to disregard the (spirit of the) law?",

But that's definitely something good! This is not a shady workaround, this is data minimization in action!\n\nHowever, such cookieless analytics must still address the question of GDPR legal basis. Either the argument is that no personal data is being processed for analytics purposes and thus no legal basis is necessary (usually wrong, even the act of anonymization is itself a data processing activity), or that the analytics processing can be based on a legitimate interest (a much more defensible argument, but not automatically true).\n\nMy personal opinion (mostly inspired by more hardline EU views such as those of the EDPB) is that it is very difficult to create truly cookieless analytics. PECR/ePrivacy is not solely about cookies, but about accessing *any* information stored on the user's device. This may include things as benign as retrieving the visitor's screen size. On the question of legal basis, I feel that if the analytics works on the level of (anonymous) page views, then it will be straightforward to pass a legitimate interest balancing test. But if the analytics solution creates GA-style visitor profiles (e.g. in order to distinguish new vs recurring visitors), or if invasive data is collected (e.g. mouse movements), then this LI balancing test becomes much more difficult.\n\nThe UK ICO, on the other hand, tends to be much more relaxed about such matters. Authorities in the UK and EU tend to be more focused on *advertising* than *analytics*. The line between those two is not always clear though, e.g. Google Analytics can be used with or without integration with the Google ads ecosystem.",

That also means the script can't do its job: blocking cookies or managing consent signals (like Google Consent Mode v2). So, even if the user hasn't consented, cookies might still be set because the logic that should prevent them isn’t even running.\n\nSure, most users who block cookie banners also block cookies, but I don't think we can assume that for everyone.

Both of those make money through advertising but everyone who watches the TV channel (at least within my region) or reads that edition of the newspaper is going to see the same ads, so why not on the internet?\n\nThe other thing that is different is that those who pay for the advertising on TV or in a newspaper pay a fixed amount - with TV possibly based on the length of the ad and when it is shown, in a newspaper often based on the size of the ad and what page it appears on. What neither pays for is the result of their advertising - i.e. when I watch TV and an ad-break comes on, if I haven't left the room at the time, it's still highly unlikely I'm immediately going to rush onto amazon and buy the advertised product. So why do they advertise? To let me know it's there so if there comes a time when I need it, I will possibly buy it.\n\nBut internet advertising appears to be different. They expect you to \"click\". The ads are often extremely intrusive and most of the time are served up by 3rd party ad-servers, which of course many of us block, including me. I only block them because they are annoying and intrusive, but another thing: if the content provider simply put something like \"this page is sponsored by ... \" at the top (and I have seen that done) it won't get blocked. I know because I have ad blockers and those are not blocked.\n\nThe other thing is that those who put their content on the web will use 3rd parties to do this, or use such tools that do all the above, and it is not actually the companies themselves who make these choices, at least not deliberately.\n\nThe fact these banners usually start with \"We respect your privacy\" or \"Your privacy matters to us\" when it clearly doesn't, and that they all look the same, to me acts as a clear indicator. This reminds me of when in around 2011 I had a page provided by [webs.com](http://webs.com) that made users fill in an illegible captcha when they logged in. I didn't want it there but had no way to remove it (nor later to start clicking on squares with whatever pictures). Similarly I wouldn't want my users to have to decline cookies, as I wouldn't use any that were not strictly necessary, and if they were just reading \"open\" content that didn't need an account, I wouldn't need to know who they were at all.",

Remember, the mere fact of asking for consent is indicative that what they're doing does not fall under \"necessity for contract\" or \"legitimate interest\".\n\nThe use of the word \"consent\" was a deliberate choice.  It is widely understood that this does not mean mere permission.  Think about what you're saying, and translate it to other contexts.  GDPR creates individual rights.  You can't sign away your rights for consideration in this manner.  I can't put a sign on my door saying that you as a visitor agree to pay me £100 or otherwise consent to, say, me injuring or killing you, or appropriating your car, or voting on your behalf, etc.  We clearly understand that those entail fundamental rights that cannot be contracted away.\n\nQuite simply, the \"consent or pay\" model can't be treated as an alternative form of payment, because you can't \"pay\" with consent.",

However, as far as I can tell, the guidelines don’t explicitly require consent to be stored in this way. In fact, the same document also says:\n\n>“Controllers are free to develop methods to comply with this provision in a way that is fitting in their daily operations. At the same time, the duty to demonstrate that valid consent has been obtained by a controller should not in itself lead to excessive amounts of additional data processing. This means that controllers should have enough data to show a link to the processing (to show consent was obtained), but they shouldn’t be collecting any more information than necessary.”\n\n**So my questions are:**\n\n* Have any of you implemented a consent log in your own cookie consent solution?\n* What are your thoughts on how best to demonstrate consent?",

It was done by a university and aims at making a *browser-wide* cookie prompt that then auto-translates into on/off for each website's prompt.  \n(I sometimes see on Reddit people recommending to hide it with an adblocker... while IN THEORY they should be out-by-default if you skip the prompt, as a dev I wouldn't 100% bet that the ACTUAL default state is on disabled.

But if it exists, it should likely be equivalent to doing nothing or the \"necessary only\" option: no consent was given. Under no circumstances should closing or ignoring a cookie banner be misconstrued as consent.\n\nIt is increasingly common to show banners or interstitials that force a choice. This is usually in the context of a \"consent or pay\" setup, where payment is required unless you give consent.

        "selftext": "I have a few questions about how to implement a cookie consent banner according to GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive.\n\nI have a Wordpress website with Vimeo videos. Because Wordpress has Guestmode enabled, it sets the cookie _lscache_vary, which records whether a visitor is logged in, and if not, it serves them a cached page.\n\nIs this a \"strictly necessary cookie\"? Probably not, as I can disable Guestmode, with the only difference being that the site gets slower because I can't use cached pages. As far as I can see, that means that **I am not allowed to cache pages until I've asked for consent**, which means that I'll have to use slow, non-cached pages for every new visitor. Have I understood that correctly?\n\nThen Vimeo sets the Cloudflare Bot Management cookie __cf_bm, which records whether the user is a human or a bot. This one... **might** be strictly necessary? I don't think there's anything I can do to stop the cookie from being written if I want Vimeo to work, in any case.\n\nSome other Vimeo and Wordpress cookies are set if the visitor logs in (a test cookie, and one that stores account details) or plays a video (preferences and Vimeo usage history cookies). I'm guessing these might all count as \"strictly necessary\" for their respective uses?\n\nSo what if the user clicks \"reject all\" on the cookie banner? What do I do then? Nothing at all, because all the remaning cookies are strictly necessary? Or does that mean that I can skip the banner entirely?\n\nAlternatively, if the Vimeo usage history cookie doesn't count as \"strictly necessary\", do I have to record their answer and block them from watching videos? Or try to figure out some way to stop Vimeo from storing usage history?\n\nI'm confused.",

This actually sounds like something optional — but hey again, maybe Vimeo experience is quite fundamental to what you do, and you would believe people would be it justified?\nShort: would suggest functional, or extra evaluation\n\n\nTake care",

                "body": "On one hand, that \"strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user\" criterion must be interpreted narrowly. In particular, necessity must be viewed from the user's perspective. For example, advertising-related cookies might be necessary for a website's business model, but they are not necessary to show that page right now.\n\nOn the other hand, this provision is commonly interpreted a bit more widely. In particular, security measures cannot be optional, they are strictly necessary for the service as a whole to work. Similarly, some degree of caching is probably necessary, and sometimes cookies are needed for that.\n\nInstead of thinking about this as a choice between \"allow all\" and \"reject all\", a more compliant viewpoint would be the three choices \"allow all\", \"customize\", and \"necessary only\".\n\nWhen embedding third party content on your pages, cookies are only part of the issue. The mere act of causing the browser to load that third-party content discloses personal data to that third party, and thus requires a legal basis. Common solutions are:\n\n* The third party is contractually bound to perform some service on your behalf, and will not use your user's data for other purposes.\n* Embedding the content is necessary, e.g. to fulfil your contract with the user or to meet a legitimate interest (this is similar to but weaker than the \"strictly necessary\" standard for cookies).\n* The user gave their consent.\n\nIn many cases, consent is the appropriate choice. This doesn't have to be part of your consent banners that primarily discuss cookies, though it can be. In case no consent has been given (yet), the embedded content might be replaced by a placeholder that asks for consent. Once consent is given, the placeholder is replaced by the actual content. I commonly see this for embedded Youtube videos, social media posts, or maps. This is a great way to ask for consent because the benefit is obvious to the user, and you can use the consent request to explain potential problems (e.g. cookies that the embed provider will set).\n\nVimeo is interesting because it might act either as a video content delivery network that is your data processor, or like a video sharing platform where embedding would likely require consent.\n\nLoading Stripe is probably necessary for the purpose of entering into a contract, but only on your checkout pages – not on other pages.",

I don't really have a say in how Vimeo and Stripe are integrated into my page – for these kinds of services, you typically include some existing Javascript code that is provided to you. \n\nFor example, allowing the users to pay without fraud prevention (as provided by the cookie) sounds insane.

If a site contains different pages, some with only text, others with videos, and a cookie is strictly necessary for showing videos but not for displaying text, then would the video cookie actually be \"strictly necessary\"?

In that case you need to write a balancing test. Something like why this stuff is good for your company and why is it bad for the customer, why are your companies rights better and how you minimize the damage the data processing causes. It is not that hard, but you need to find a few examples first to know how it should look like. Another ground that you have a contract with the customer and that fraud prevention cookie is required to fulfill the contract. In the case of webshops I think this latter is a lot more common because you have a contract before payment.",

They basically provide that either the ’user’ (the person using the ISS) or the subscriber (the person who has a contract with the internet service provider) must consent to the setting of cookies and similar technologies on the equipment (desktop computer, laptop, mobile device etc) being used. This is not quite the same as consenting to the processing of personal data in UK GDPR terms. **However, it remains the case that for consent to be valid the person providing it must understand what they are consenting to.** This means that you need to take proportionate measures, taking into account the risks inherent in technology being used, **to ensure that a child providing their own consent is competent to do so.** Further information on what this means in practice will be provided when our guidance on cookies is updated.\n\nIt has been argued that certain age verification schemes (like a check-box that says you're over a certain age) is not adequate for determining if someone is of the proper age.  So if you are confident with your age verification scheme then theoretically you can put the two together so long as its clear.  If the consent is for marketing, that option needs to turned off and based on what is happening with Meta, you are unlikely able to force targeted advertising (especially if it's children).",

In fact, a lot of websites track you as soon as you land on their home page, even though you haven't had a chance to interact with the consent panel yet.\n\nUntil the authorities do their job and really enforce GDPR (and even then, they can't do much against companies/websites which have no presence in the EU), the most effective way to prevent tracking is to use a dedicated browser extension. The best one is uBlock Origin, and it soon won't be as effective as it was on Chrome or other Chromium-based browsers (because of Manifest V3). So again, use Firefox or one of its forks. I am not sure Brave (which is Chromium-based) will still support Manifest V2 when V3 rolls out, and Brave's own tracking protection is lackluster compared to uBO.",

It is up to the data controller to demonstrate that their specific approach enables valid consent.\n\nMy personal belief is that the vast majority of “consent or pay” approaches do not enable valid consent, since the paid approach often requires a multi-month subscription and costs disproportionally more than what the website would earn through tracking. There could also be issues with access from underbanked persons, e.g. minors. Underlying problem is a lack of satisfactory solutions for web-based micropayments.",

Anyway, idk how this will be seen once the EDPB-shepherded Meta decision will come out in January. See below a brief contractual and DP assessment and some ranting in the end. \n\nSo, pursuing the assessment of this practical scenario starting with what basically means paying for smth - it's a contract, right? If you pay for smth, then you have a contract.  \n\nThis being said, I take an issue with the contractual side of this. Basically, it's a payment in kind for access to a service, which should be covered in the website TCs and will be subject to consumer protection legislation - especially the provisions related to Digital Content Services in the EU. And this is just to start a discussion on this, if anyone's interested. As above, this is subject to the Meta decision acquis in a sense that, if the EDPB says that marketing processing cannot be subject to a contract, but only to consent separate from a contract (and signs are this will be the case), then you still need consent to process the personal data for marketing ends, which will potentially kill the practice subject to our talk. We're moving in circles. Best solution is to create paywalls with subscriber-only accessible content - but that's only for the big publishers, not for everyone. Anyway, it's not my job to decide who's getting paid here and who pays. \n\nAlso, w/out repeating the above arguments on consent validity, am just noting that the consent should be informed, i.e., the privacy notice should be sufficiently detailed to explain what happens w/ the user's data, who uses it (this is where the third parties mentioned above and what they do should be presented in clear language) and to what end. Have never seen a privacy notice that comes even close to the GDPR standards on discussing advertising processing purposes; and here comes the ranting: the IAB framework is a joke; the overall interest is to dupe uneducated users into providing their data for marketing purposes, which can be monetized quickly and w/out regrets; unbiased consent is dead, long live dark patterns!",

It says that consent is required when:\n\n* accessing or storing information on the end user's device, unless that access/storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user, or when\n\n* using non-anonymized traffic data for purposes other than performing the transmission.\n\nNote that the purpose is decisive, not the data itself. For the access/storage case, it doesn't even matter if the information is personal data.\n\nThere is an old WP29 document from 2014 that argues that basically any use of JavaScript APIs in the browser can require consent, because use of such APIs implies access to information on the end user's device.\n\nSo if you need to access the user agent string or JavaScript APIs in order to display the site properly, that is going to be perfectly fine without consent. For example, if you want to serve a fallback site for Internet Explorer users, or to change the page layout when the window is less than 600px wide.\n\nBut if you access the same information for a different purpose that is not strictly necessary, then you're going to need consent. Analytics are not strictly necessary.\n\nSo under a strict reading of the ePD, the only way to run analytics without consent is to use anonymized traffic data, without client-side data collection. That traffic data may or may not involve using the user-agent HTTP header, though by itself the user agent string might not be quite anonymous.\n\nThe ePD is of course insane because it leaves no middle ground between “strictly necessary” and “consent”. Notably, it lacks a concept of “legitimate interest”. This has been lamented since about a decade, but the proposed ePrivacy Regulation still hasn't been passed (any year now…).",

They are for example used for frequency capping, so an advertiser does not show the same ad dozens of times to the same visitor.\n\nIf no consent is given on this part, you can only serve very basic ads though the worlds most used ad server: Google Ad Manager, and you are locked out of Adsense:\n\n>Non-personalized ads are targeted using contextual information rather than the past behavior of a user. Although these ads don’t use cookies for ads personalization, they do use cookies to allow for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting, and to combat fraud and abuse. **Consent is therefore required to use cookies for those purposes from users in countries to which the EU ePrivacy Directive’s cookie provisions apply.**\n\nSo what happens when people click 'reject all' is locking websites out of all their advertising revenue from the worlds most used ad exchanges.\n\nWhich is why the issue needs to be fixed at the core, where Google is by far the largest player. Otherwise you are taking down news publishers and information websites, while Google and Facebook happily continue to take the ad money on their platforms making them even more powerful online.\n\nI am a big supporter of GDPR. But right now the playing field is not level. The large corporations have massive power and going after the small players will not have the impact needed to shape the internet in a more privacy oriented way. It will just serve to make it even more difficult for a lot of websites to simply survive in an online world where Google and Facebook already take most of the money home.\n\nIt's a bit like investigating the tiny bit of tax fraud of small business, while letting giant corporations get away with tax evasions in the hundreds of billions every year. Clearly the priority should be on the large companies, yet it is on the smaller ones, since that is an easier target.",

If that is not handled carefully, and a good amount of publishers see their ability to serve even non-personalized ads removed, that will have very negative effects.\n\nI am very aware of the efforts of the NPO in The Netherlands, since that is actually my home country. The hundreds of millions of subsidies they get each year do not really compare to the budgets most publishers have to develop infrastructure and tools. They also have a good amount of video content that is in high demand, which does not compare very well to advertising around written content that makes up most of the web. Let alone the budget to market these solutions (which is basically just grouping titles into some content categories) towards advertising agencies and the agreements that are involved in that. It's also interesting the choice was made to ban online advertising for the NPO since this year, so it seems the returns on it was not enough for the government to place that much value in it in the first place. But that is another discussion again.\n\nWho will be hurt is the independent publishers who is already struggling right now due the dominance of Google and Facebook online.

These data protection rules do not distinguish commercial purposes from other purposes. From the GDPR perspective, data controller is whoever determines the purposes and means of processing of the personal data, regardless of their motivation. A publicly accessible blog generally falls outside of the GDPR's exemption for purely personal or household purposes.\n\nSo yes, you will need a privacy notice since you will be processing personal data of visitors and contributors. See Art 13 GDPR for the exact requirements, but the ICO has published excellent summaries and checklists for the “right to be informed”.\n\nUnder certain conditions, you are required to ask the data subjects/users for consent before doing something. In particular, this is the case when accessing or storing information on the user's device, such as by using cookies, unless that access/storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user. For example:\n\n* cookies for advertisement purposes → not strictly necessary for the site to work, needs consent\n* session cookies for logged-in users → strictly necessary, no consent needed\n* CSRF protection cookies → strictly necessary for the site to work securely, no consent needed\n* cookie to remember consent status → strictly necessary, no consent needed\n\nOnly if you do something that needs consent will you have to show consent/cookie banners. It is quite possible that you will not need to show a consent banner, similar to how GitHub decided to remove friction by getting rid of non-necessary cookies.\n\nIf you do have to ask for consent, you must consider the Art 7 GDPR requirements (again summarised by excellent ICO guidance). Consent must be the user's free choice, they must be able to decline without suffering detriment. Using a third party consent management solution can help, but doesn't automatically make you compliant.",

I show a cookie banner that, practically speaking, leaves three choices:\n\n* the user explicitly consents for non-necessary cookies\n* the user explicitly declines consent for non-necessary cookies\n* the user ignores the cookie banner\n\nI think we can agree that things are clear for options #1 and #3: If the user accepts non-necessary cookies, fine. If the user does not indicate any wishes, then no consent is given (consent is never the default) and I can't set unnecessary cookies or load tracking or third party content or whatever.\n\nBut the second option is interesting here. The user has indicated that they are not interested in giving consent, and I should honour that decision.\n\nIf I don't remember that decision anywhere, then the next time the user loads a page (such as following a link on my website), they'll get the cookie banner again. For each page, they'd have to click the banner away again. Even though they declined consent on a previous page, that user would be indistinguishable from a new visitor who was never asked for consent.\n\nI think this clearly violates the spirit of ePrivacy/GDPR, as it is essentially a kind of nagging/dark pattern – the only way to durably get rid of the cookie banner would be to give consent, which doesn't sound like a freely given choice.\n\nSo, to honour the user's decision to not give consent, it is *strictly necessary* to remember that decision. On websites that offer user registration, this decision can and should be stored server-side. For other sites, client-side storage such as cookies is the only option.\n\nThe only other solution to this dilemma that I see is to argue that any consent solution that potentially distracts the user or gets in the way is per se noncompliant.\n\nI want to underline ePrivacy's strict necessity principle does not allow information from cookies to be reused for different purposes. For example, if a cookie is set as strictly necessary for consent management purposes, then I cannot also use that cookie to detect returning visitors for other purposes like analytics.\n\nThe consent status cookie problem also doesn't arise in those situations where no banner or popup is needed. For example, if I'm asking for consent to load third party content on a web page, then I can replace that content with a placeholder which asks for consent. In that scenario, I'd be totally with you that no cookie would be necessary to remember the “user has not yet given consent” status.",

Here is my long overdue reply.\n\nI get the dilemma you are pointing to; if a user refuses the cookie, he will be faced again and again and again with a consent banner. But I believe this is a false dilemma because it is created by those wanting to use non-essential technologies in the first place. \n\nConsent banners are doing these checks in an unlawful and backwards way. How it should work is that:\n\n1) User requests the webpage\n\n2) The consent platform checks if the user has accepted non-essential technologies by looking for a cookie indicating which non-essential technologies to load.\n\nIf the user is visiting the site for the first time they will not have such a cookie set. If the user has visited previously, but rejected cookies, they also should not have such a cookie. The default under ePrivacy and the Planet49 judgement is that only strictly necessary cookies are permitted without consent.\n\nRecording whether non-essential technologies are refused is not strictly necessary. The argument to the contrary, that it needs to be set because otherwise the banner will be presented each time, stems from the fact that the webpage wants to use non-essential technologies in the first place.\n\n3) Most websites would then load a consent banner irrespective of whether or not a cookie storing that a user has consented exists or not. \n\n4) If the user then does not consent to anything. You shouldn't set a cookie that says that the user hasn't consented to anything. This would be contrary to the ePrivacy directive because it isn't necessary. The default is no unnecessary storage, which entails that if the user doesn't consent to anything, there is no need to store anything - the absence of a preference cookie is enough to determine not to load any non-essential technologies. Only when the user consents is a cookie needed indicating which technologies was consented to. \n\n\\-\n\nI get that this in practice will lead to constant reoccurring cookie banners, but that is only because the website wishes to use the non-essential technologies in the first place. \n\nThe banner that will keep re showing is only an issue because the ad tracking industry chooses to do so. You can absolutely honor the users choice to refuse to consent without storing that refusal in a cookie. It is then a choice to keep showing the consent banner. \n\nBut the mere inconvenience of constantly reoccurring banners does not impact the necessity test under law. I totally get your point of view, but I don't agree with it for aforementioned reasons. \n\n... Feel free to take 5 months to reply :')",

If ePrivacy would allow a legitimate interest standard, it is likely that some unintrusive cookie-based analytics would be allowed without consent.\n\nI think it is fair to *ask* users if they want to allow that, but if they say no then I'll have to actually respect that. That “no” makes it strictly necessary to remember this decision.\n\nSimilarly, if I ask a person out (which can be a legitimate, non-creepy thing to do), and they say no, then I'm going to respect that and *stop asking them*. Asking them again every day would be harassment.\n\nI've been reading the [new German website/consent/cookie guidelines (PDF)](https://www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/media/oh/20221205_oh_Telemedien_2021_Version_1_1_Vorlage_104_DSK_final.pdf) that dropped yesterday. One thing they emphasize is that giving consent and declining consent must be equally easy. While they don't state this explicitly, I think this goes beyond counting how many clicks are necessary to give or decline consent – it should also mean that I should remember given/declined consent status for a similar amount of time. They do explicitly mention that consent status can be managed without long-term identifiers in cookies, but unfortunately they don't state the reverse that storing declined consent with a simple `consent=no` cookie would typically be acceptable.",

I've always understand that as a safeguard to prevent ordinary users from wrongly being pushed into a controller role. For example, without that Recital, I'm like 80% sure Facebook would have tried the argument that the users are data controllers, and FB is just a processor acting on their behalf.\n\nEven though many blogs have social networking features, I'm not sure that blogging is social networking within the meaning of that Recital. But it's difficult to find a clear cutoff point.\n\n* posts personal stuff on traditional social media sites like FB/Twitter/Mastodon → probably covered by household exemption, the social media service is the controller\n* posts personal stuff on a blogging-oriented social media site like Medium → uuh, not sure, probably (joint) controller with Medium?\n* runs a hosted Blogspot or Wordpress blog for posting personal stuff, possibly on a custom domain → quite likely to be a controller since the author is now making a LOT of decisions regarding purposes and means of processing\n* runs their own web server on a rented VPS → who else could be the data controller?\n\nSince in either case the content is made available to the general public, and since this clearly involves a data processing activity, I'm sure that *someone* must be the data controller.",

Article 4(11) of GDPR defines consent:   \n“Consent of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.”  \nHere’s a primer on what constitutes a compliant cookie banner or popup.\n\n* Display a cookie banner on a user’s first visit to your website.\n* Inform users that your site uses cookies, why it's used or their purposes in plain, simple language.\n* Collect users’ active consent to cookies i.e. display both ‘accept’ and ‘reject’ cookies button.\n* Give users the option to opt-in to specific cookie categories. (For eg. in the second layer of the cookie banner)\n* Do not use pre-ticked or ‘on’ sliders for cookies other than strictly necessary cookies.\n* Block third-party cookies from being set on the user’s device until the user gives explicit consent for their use. (This can be automated through consent management platforms or CMPs like CookieYes)\n* Store cookie consents in case you are subject to audit or you have to demonstrate proof that your site is compliant.\n* Have a cookie policy within your privacy policy or as a separate page in your website.\n* Provide detailed information – name of the provider that sets the cookie (first-party or third-party), description and cookie duration in your cookie policy.\n* Give users a user-friendly and easily accessible option to revoke or withdraw consent.\n* Do not use cookie walls that prevent access to the website (unless the user accepts or is forced to accept cookies)\n* Do not set cookies if the user is scrolling or continuing to use a website without interacting with the cookie banner.\n* Some Data Protection Authorities like the Italian DPA also requires the banner to have a close button so users can dismiss it easily.  \nDepending on the EU member state your website is primarily based in or caters to the specific guidelines may differ. These are generally published by the respective DPA such as CNIL in France, AEPD in Spain, GDDP in Italy and so on.",

If you deny that person a service unless they “consent”, their “consent” would not have been freely given. \n\nTherefore, the appropriateness of a cookie paywall largely depends on nature of the service offered. In a democratic society in which every person, rich or poor, has an equal voice, and in which journalism provides important checks and balances on our constitutional institutions, it is arguably distasteful to require poor people to sell their privacy (assuming the UK GDPR and not merely PECR applies to these hypothetical cookies - e.g. due to the level of tracking and personalisation), a human right, for access to professional journalism.",

That isn’t to say that vaguely similar models haven’t been adopted. The BBC is funded by licence fees, for example, and its news is provided free of charge. Parliament has power to abolish the licence fee, which is currently a hot political issue.\n\nAs to revenue from *personalised* adverts being the *only* feasible business model for private news corporations, I am going to have to take your word for it. I would never profess to have expertise in business. I thought, though, that some news corporations offer key, political, “public-interest” articles free of charge without cookie paywalls, but generate additional revenue streams by charging for access to other things like hard copies, articles on lifestyle, fashion, food, sport, celebrity culture, special features, music, film, television, as well as other commentary and reviews, sometimes in the form of supplementary magazines. Many also rely on donations, which can be substantial. It is also worth remembering that not every user refuses to provide their consent to personalised adverts - I would be interested to know the statistics. It shouldn’t be forgotten that many users find personalised adverts desirable.\n\nAssuming you are right, yes, it is a valid point and courts are always going to need to weigh up and balance individuals’ rights with the rights of others and the public interest at large. If not having cookie paywalls would mean that private news corporations would fold, this would likely not be in the public interest as society would lose a large chunk of its independent journalism.",

Yikes, public interest much? I am actually surprised it's so low, in France a lot of people bash newspapers and other media for supposedly living off government aids.\n- more than 66% (!!!) of revenue come from from subscriptions and sales\n- ads revenue is allegedly falling and not that great anymore. Though they still have an illegal paywall (consent to cookies or subscribe) and do not disclose in the linked article how much revenue ads are actually generating, which I find suspicious.\n- partnerships and sponsorships (donations, news aggregators...)\n- [...]\n\nStatitics about many newspapers and media are required to try to establish if the majority of them have revenu streams similar to Le Monde or if it's an exception.\n\nBut IMO your question is actually bigger than journalism related websites: Really it's about the fact that people are used to having access to all websites for free while websites survive mostly thanks to (targeted, as you said) ads. But that business model is not compatible with privacy legislations such as GDPR: [Look at what NOYB recently did to Facebook.](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-surveillance-capitalism/) So we are at a crossroad where many websites will die if they don't manage to radically change their business model. Subscription only access (e.g. Netflix) might work if the website manages to convince people that the provided service is worth it, but I guess a lot of websites won't be able to pull that off.\\\nPeople will also have to drop the \"everything on the internet is free\" mindset, but it will take time, time during which a lot of websites will die. I am not sure it's a bad thing though, at least for all the clickbait focused websites not providing anything original or of any value.",

For those too young to know, there was a time when you would go to a website and be presented a form of your \"interests\" that you filled with a few clicks and then they would serve you ads accordingly. \n\n\\- There are many websites that use the \"pay to remove ads\" model. The difference is \"pay us to remove the annoying ads\" instead of \"pay us to stop selling your personal information\". \n\n\\- Donation models. People get to choose how much they are willing to pay to support their news outlet so that people who have the means can (voluntarily) pay more. The downside is that we should be very careful with this model to make sure that those donations do not have strings attached to secure the integrity of journalism.\n\n\\- Freemium models. Public-interest news should be free (world news, national news). Entertainment news (fashion, sports) can be paywalled since it is not in the public interest to know what happened to (insert name of celebrity). However, this comes with a risk of journalism moving a lot of resources to entertainment news in order to grab subscribers.\n\n\\- If journalism is a basic service, so it should not be a commercial enterprise. As seen in the USA, commercial journalism has led to the production of \"news\" that people want to see, as opposed to news that people should actually know. If we publicly fund schools, we can also publicly fund journalism. Of course, there is the risk and the fear that publicly funded journalism is going to lead to state-controlled media, so safeguards have to be put in place.",

This seems really difficult, I think.\n\nMy personal belief is that the root cause problem isn't consent or cost, but the lack of a widely adopted solution for online micropayments. If payments on the order of 0.10 EUR can be processed without excessive fees, if such payment systems were integrated into browsers and could be authorized with a single click, if kids could easily pay pocket money into that system, then there is a straightforward path for implementing consent-or-pay solutions in an obviously compliant manner.",

They are not strictly necessary for the website to work. Thus, even allegedly-anonymous first-party analytics cookies require consent.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the cookie consent issue was never the problem with Google Analytics. It is a data quality problem because you can't see users that didn't give consent, but it's not necessarily a compliance issue. GA cookies are also set as first-party cookies. That GA fails to be GDPR-compliant has much more to do with data transfers into the United States.\n\nBecause some users might not give consent to analytics, there is an interest in cookie-less analytics. Or more precisely, analytics that don't require consent under European rules. The most straightforward way to achieve this is to do server-side analytics that do not collect additional data beyond what is technically necessary. However, this strongly limits what you can see.

While I am aware of the existence of some implementations of the proxy idea, the approach really hasn't taken off, and websites tend to migrate to other analytics services (which may or may not be better than GA).\n\nBut yes, I believe that if cookie consent is sorted out and if a pseudonymization proxy strips out identifying info (such as user IDs, IP addresses, …), then the use of GA could still be compliant. Pseudonymization is recognized by the EDPB as a potential supplemental measure to make data transfers into the US legal, see [Use Case 2 / paragraph 85 in their Recommendations (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en). The cookie consent question can be resolved either by receiving consent for storing cookies, or by not storing/accessing any data on the user's device. For example, the GA4 \"consent mode\" may or may not be helpful here. But if you don't rely on consent, you'd need an alternative legal basis such as a \"legitimate interest\", potentially requiring you to  offer an opt-out.",

GDPR itself is the same everywhere, and the GDPR makes it very clear where and how your national laws could deviate.\n\nThe entire point of EU law such as Directives and Regulations is to create a Single Market where you only have to deal with a single set of rules (the ones in your home country), not 27+3 different rules depending on where customers/users are from.\n\nThe Dutch exemption on analytics cookies is potentially invalid, because the ePrivacy Directive does not afford member states any leeway to add further exceptions to the consent requirement. The ePrivacy cookie consent requirement is independent from the concept of GDPR legal basis, so the Dutch DPA's suggestion of a \"legitimate interest\" for analytical cookies looks objectively wrong to me. In any case, read the Dutch guidelines here: https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/onderwerpen/internet-telefoon-tv-en-post/cookies\n\nSimilarly, the German law providing a similar exemption was rather dubious since the relevant rules appeared in the ePrivacy directive, especially since GDPR clarified the definition of consent.

My understanding is that under the ePrivacy Directive, this still requires cookie consent, as it is data stored on the user's terminal device.\n\nSecond, the hashing inputs do not include hostname. This allows tracking users across different websites without a direct hand-off, something which is not possible with the first-party cookies used by Google Analytics. This is, in one particular respect, more invasive than regular tracking that relies on first-party cookies. I believe it may also put you at greater risk for CCPA. \n\nI also don't think there's a strong value proposition in preventing third-party providers from linking an identifier to a data subject. They're Processors/Service Providers. They are contractually and legally obligated not to attempt to identify data subjects except under the Controller's direction. What threat model is this protecting against? And, more to the point, why does that threat model *not include you*, another third-party service provider processing the same data?\n\nI have some concerns that this doesn't actually count as anonymization under GDPR and/or CCPA. You're over-focusing on the ability to tie the identifier back to the identity. But you're still building a profile on a user and tying those data points together, which can still be personal data if the profile is rich enough. The boundaries of that are still untested. \n\nFrom a pragmatic view, destroying the data every 24 hours means no data on repeat visitors or long-term engagement. That's going to kill a lot of use cases for Google Analytics. I'll be the first to tell you that 90% of the features don't get used by most people, but that's a big one that's widely considered one of the basic fundamentals.",

It also comforts us that being open and transparent can benefit both the community and us.\n\nVerifying claims and, more generally, trusting third-party services, if not dogmatic, is certainly a matter of communication, certification, transparency, and time. I can't argue this point.\n\nWe consider that the entropy provided by the /dev/urandom of AWS Lambda is not sufficient as far as the security of our customers is concerned and thus do prefer to rely on industrial-strength sources. \n\nWe claim publicly on our website that we forward to Google Analytics a \"cryptographically secure pseudorandom identifier (**generated from** a minimum of 384-bits of entropy)\". In other words, we are talking about the randomness of generated IDs (guaranteed by at least 384 bits of entropy) and not about their lengths. Also, we don't see any argument in favor of generating random IDs larger than 128bit.\n\nConcerning Kinesis, the MD5 hash used for the partition key is not about security but about partitioning and distributing data in the Kinesis shards for load balancing purposes. Furthermore, this hash's security is out of scope as **we store the actual data in Kinesis**.\n\nWe claim publicly on our website that \"anything at **rest** uses AES-256 GCM **encryption**\". It concerns data stored in Kinesis. In other words, the security of data in Kinesis is guaranteed by symmetric encryption and not by hash algorithms. Please be aware that we provide a multi-part data processing pipeline, and the security of the approach relies on multiple complementary aspects. It should not be reduced to simple hashing algorithms. \n\nConcerning Dynamodb, we use a keyed hashing algorithm with a 32 bytes key generated randomly from at least 384 bits of entropy. There is nothing even vaguely foreseeable with the current state of arts, including quantum computers, able to brute force this hash. Note however that the IDs stored in DynamoDB are also encrypted at rest using AES-256 GCM encryption.\n\nWhat is really interesting, though, is that we don't even count on the security of the hashes in DynamoDB to guarantee that forwarded IDs are secure and anonymous. We actually count on a well simpler mechanism. We destroy information. The id sent to Google Analytics is random and doesn't carry any bit of relevant information.\n\nConcerning the linkability, we also publicly claim that we map the IID to OID and destroy the mapping after 24h. This is how we maintain the fundamental building blocks of Google Analytics (e.g., sessions, visitors, etc.). The true anonymization will be achieved after 24h; thank you for pointing that out; this is the core feature we are providing. After 24h, and as long as the data exists in Google Analytics, individuals are completely anonymous. During 24h, they are pseudo-anonymous, and as per recital 26 of GDPR, there is no means reasonably likely to be used to identify the actual individual neither. \n\nNevertheless, you have discovered a bug regarding the \"real\" TTL of a mapping in the worst case, where data can potentially remain in Kinesis during the maximum amount of 24h due to a technical consumption problem downstream and therefore added to the 24h of DynamoDB. We have already provided a [patch](https://github.com/priveraio/privera/commit/597b539). I have also thanked you in the commit message for having reported this issue, even though this process could have been simpler if reported directly on GitHub.\n\nA quick note concerning the 15min in the 24h15min of TTL. Note that the mapping is effectively destroyed after 24h as we change the hash key exactly after 24h; the TTL only concerns a technical point of how we need to drain the database. As far as security is concerned, we cannot compute the same hash anymore after exactly 24h.\n\nOne more time. Thank you very much for having expressed your concerns.

                "body": "Thank you so much for your thoughtful feedback.\n\nLet's summarize some fundamental aspects of the project as I see some misunderstanding about what's happening under the hood.\n\nFirst, apart from the identification part (hold on), we do not store any data at all. For instance, when we receive let say the title and the URL of the page, this data is not stored by us and is forwarded to the downstream service provider. We do not create any kind of profile, etc.\n\nNow, let's talk identity. \n\nThe hash includes the IP, the UA, and the API key. This API key is, for now, the UA property ID that serves as a \"silo\" id to separate data of the same user across websites. We can push it further, but without going into deep details here, it is the data controller's responsibility to fix the limit of the \"range\" of the identity of its users, and for now, it is tied to the property ID.\n\nThen, you \"don't think there's a strong value proposition in preventing third-party providers from linking an identifier to a data subject\" (the anonymization process from the processor's point of view). But you also see only half of the value proposition. In effect, we also prevent the data controller from linking a data subject to its data (the anonymization process from the controller's point of view). \n\nTo explain in more detail the identification process, you must also understand that this is a one-way process. And that's where its strength resides. As I said earlier, we do not store any PII, which means we store neither the IP nor the UA. So how it works? We hash the (IP, UA, API KEY) cryptographically and store the result (for 24h, but hold on). So if I give you a dump of the database or throw it in public today, it is implausible you can extract anything meaningful and certainly not the IP or the UA. But we go even further because what may be true today may change tomorrow. So we map this strong id to a random one. This way, we are literally \"destroying\" the underlying data. So even in the future, if someone has access to your data in your GA account, he literally can't retrieve any PII. But wait, now we, the proxy, become the bottleneck. That's where the 24h comes in. To mitigate any risks of data-breach, nothing lasts for more than 24h in our infrastructure. \n\nThe 24h has another side effect. We cannot track the same user's identity across days. Even though I can understand that your position may be different, we consider this a feature for individuals. This is an ideological standpoint and, as such, can be open to interpretation. However, we firmly think that we have to balance respecting users' privacy and conducting business efficiently. The 24h limit, we think, is the right balance. \n\nTo really summarize (my pretty dense answer). \n\nWe do not store PII. We are compliant with GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, etc. Our sole value proposition (sorry for the minimalism) is to make individuals completely anonymous while not breaking your GA.",

This is the most important feature we are providing. The anonymity of the user with regards to you, to GA, and even to us as we do not store anything that allows linking back to a living individual. \n\n\\- If a site operator considers self-hosting the CE, then you are doing well because you are providing the same kind of anonymization as us.

So in any world at any time now or in the future, no one would be even able to do anything with this id. It is random and doesn't encode any data. Hope you're no more skeptical.",

(IP and user-agent being considered as \"passive\" browser fingerprinting)\n\n\\- Limited exception for analytics: There will be an exemption for website analytics, recognizing that this is not an intrusive activity. However, it will only apply to analytics carried out by the website provider. It is not clear if third-party analytic cookies, like Google Analytics, will benefit from this exemption.\n\nTakeaways: User-agent + IP is a kind of cookie.\n\nIn Opinion 01/2017, Article 29 Working party (“WP29”) clarified that cookies are exempted from the requirement of express and informed consent by considering \"first party analytics cookies are not likely to create a privacy risk when they are strictly limited to first-party aggregated statistical purposes and anonymized.\n\nTakeaways: User-agent + IP does not require consent if used for statistics and anonymized.\n\nYou may now wonder why using Privera. After all, as per the above explanations, and should the revision of the EPR be deemed appropriate, express and informed consent will not be required for first-party analytics?\n\nThe question is whether GA can be considered as an aggregated statistics and first-party analytics service? And it is all about anonymization.\n\nYou (the data controller) and GA (the data processor) are still able to \"identify\" individuals. A very concrete example is your capacity to single out users by some predicate and then use its cookie id (the \"cid\" that is available in clear in GA) to retarget the same user the next time he comes back to your website (as you also have the same cid as a first-party cookie on your website). Clearly, the user is not anonymous and you fall under the regulation (I'm not even talking about possibilities for Google to be able to reidentify users).\n\nNow with Privera, you are guaranteed to not be able to identify individuals as you don't have access to the way the hash of IP+ua is mapped to the \"cid\" you will find in your GA (and vice versa for GA). Moreover and as explained in another comment, we do not store any data neither and we cannot even rebuild the hash or find its mapping to the random cid as we destroy everything after 24h.\n\nThat is what we are all about here: providing anonymity. Getting rid of the cookie is the icing on the cake :).",

While they do say there are limited privacy risks, they explicitly state that such cookies do not fall within either of the exemptions, eg, here:\n\n“While they are often considered as a “strictly necessary” tool for website operators, they are not strictly necessary to provide a functionality explicitly requested by the user (or subscriber).

Personally, HSMs are overkill for this use case.\n\nIn the open source/CE edition, you're using a cryptographically secure RNG (e.g. /dev/urandom on Linux), so that is truly secure as far as I am concerned for the ID passed to GA. This OID uses 128 bits which is totally sufficient in this context, though quite far from the claimed 384 bits of security.\n\nIt is worth noting that various intermediate IDs are created for storage in various Amazon services, in particular DynamodDB and Kinesis. These IDs are substantially weaker (e.g. due to use of MD5 or non-cryptographic RNGs for deriving keys), and these IDs can be linked with the secure OID. As long as this linkability exists, it would be unwise to assume that the OID were actually anonymized. The IID–OID association has a TTL, so that true anonymization will be achieved after 24h 15min elapse since the Kinesis event is processed. The events may be pending in Kinesis for 24 hours, so that there might be up to 50 hours between the user's visit event and the onset of anonymization.",

While the resulting data in GA might still allow singling out in *some* cases using contextual information, your OID is an exceptionally strong form of anonymization. The 128 bits are more than enough.\n* My concerns about the IID generation do not impact the security of the overall scheme, under the assumption that the Proxy (and AWS) is trustworthy.\n* You provide clear arguments for the technical security of the scheme, though I don't necessarily agree with the details.\n\nI am somewhat confused though by the IID key, which you claim is inaccessible after 24 hours. In the dispatcher's Handle() method for the CE, I see the following code.\n\n\tseedh := sha256.New()\n\tio.WriteString(seedh, functionName)\n\tio.WriteString(seedh, time.Now().UTC().Format(\"2006-01-02\"))\n\thrand := mrand.New(mrand.NewSource(int64(binary.BigEndian.Uint64(seedh.Sum(nil)))))\n\tvar hkey [32]byte\n\t_, err := hrand.Read(hkey[:])\n\n* the `functionName` is known by the operator and is likely guessable\n* the YYYY-MM-DD date is predictable, and can be reconstructed at a later date (so the IID hash *can* be recomputed after 24 hours!)\n* `seedh.Sum(nil)` is a 256-bit hash\n* `int64(...)` extracts 64 bits from this\n* the 64-bit seed is used for a mathematical RNG, which is [remarkably poor and unusual](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21835) even for PRNGs of its class\n* 32 bytes (256 bits) are deterministically extracted from this RNG\n\nIt seems that the detour with mrand weakens the key to 64 bits, and this detour can be removed entirely. Also, the entropy is likely much lower than 64 bits as the function name + date are somewhat predictable. But again: this doesn't impact the security of this scheme. In principle, the whole IID concept could be removed entirely since you and your storage are trustworthy by definition – simply using `IID = sha256(IP + UA + YYYYMMDD)` as a lookup key for the current OID would have almost identical security properties to your current solution, and you might not even need a cryptographic hash function.\n\nI'm discussing that here instead of GH because I'm not sure about your security goals for the CE. While I can read the code, I cannot infer intention without some kind of documentation (code comments, architecture documentation, security whitepaper, …).\n\nAs another potential bug regarding IIDs, consider that the IID–OID mapping has a 24:15 hour TTL, but that the IID will change at UTC midnight. This will break GA sessions around UTC midnight. Considering traffic patterns, it is more likely that visitors from the middle east will keep their IDs for a full day, whereas the change would occur during high-traffic periods in the US. Rotating the IID key at 3AM local time for the geolocation derived from the IP could be a great feature for your EE.\n\nI also think that your use of DynamoDB has a race condition, though again it will not affect the security of this scheme, at most lead to a small data quality loss. **I would not fix this.** Assume a new visitor that generates multiple events over a short timeframe. Assume *two* lambda instances consuming Kinesis events, so that both instances each get an event involving the user. Both instances will generate their own random OID and will keep using it for all events of that user within the batch. Both will write the OID to DynamoDB, and it's not clear to me which write would win. Thus, there will be at most 20 (batchsize) events in GA with the wrong Client ID. The split could persist even across sequential lambda invocations due to DynamoDB's eventual consistency. In practice, this shouldn't matter unless the database is distributed across multiple AWS regions.",

I will try to address each of your new remarks even though it is indubitably out of any interest for a non-technical audience who may read this :)  IMHO discussing in GitHub would benefit a broader audience. Anyway.\n\nConcerning your confusion about our claim that the IID is inaccessible after 24 hours.  \nYour whole reasoning starts with \"the functionName is known by the operator and is likely guessable\". It is not true. We use the function name as a viable random component in CE because when you deploy the provided infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, then AWS append a random suffix to the function name.  \nThis provides the first component of the hash key that is **random** but **stable across function invocations**.  \nTo reset the hash key after 24h, now we need another component that deterministically changes after 24h. Nothing better than the current timestamp truncated to the day.  \nNext, you talk about the quality of the resulting key. As I've already overly discussed this subject, in CE, this is the best we can achieve given the aforementioned constraints and the absence of other entropy sources. Note that this whole key generation part is replaced by a random key generated daily by the HSM in the hosted version. Moreover, any CE contribution is more than welcome if you want to provide one that complies with the constraints.\n\nOur security goals about CE are nothing out of the ordinary.  It must be as secure as possible, and as I said previously, anyone can contribute to fixes, improvements, documentation, etc. It is an open-source project.\n\nConcerning the singling-out remark. When using Google Analytics as is, you collect a lot of contextual information about the user (e.g., screen size, plugin versions, etc.). So your risk of singling out an individual is more than a theoretical risk, to not say elevated. Moreover, outside this contextual info, your users' cookie id is available in clear in Google Analytics for days. You can single out and target a particular individual if needed.  \nIn Privera, we adopted a way more frugal approach. Thus, you roughly end up with random ids and page views. We estimate the absolute and relative risk of singling-out an individual to be ridiculously low. If you want to dig into this specific subject, I recommend this paper on the [formalization of the GDPR’s notion of singling out](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/15/8344) (also referenced publicly on our website).  \n\n\nConcerning your remarks about sessions breakage. We are aware of this current limitation, and we did it on purpose. This initial version is an MVP and couldn't reasonably come out fully featured. We will provide ASAP an option to associate a timezone to the GA property ID (as currently possible in GA) both in the hosted and in the CE version. This way, the data controller will have the expected session stability. That said, thank you for pointing this out.\n\nConcerning the possible race condition on DynamoDB. Your reasoning starts with \"assume two lambda instances consuming Kinesis events\". It is not possible. Do you remember the MD5 hash of the partition key? In short, the way Kinesis works and the way we distribute data into it strongly guarantees that any event coming from a particular touchpoint will be stored on a well-known shard and will be processed sequentially by a single and well-known instance of a Lambda. By construction, we get the best balance between parallel processing of different touchpoints and sequential processing of the same touchpoint. Moreover, when processing the incoming stream of events from a particular touchpoint, we use the \"qt\" (queue time) parameter provided by GA measurement protocol to ensure that GA ingests events in order.  \nI won't go into the details of a multi-region deployment as it is obviously out of scope here. But keep in mind that it can be achieved with DynamoDB global tables and streams.  \n\n\nI think that I've addressed your new concerns and hope to see you star the GitHub repo as you seem to be more than intrigued by the project. :)",

I like bashing Fathom a lot because they have lots of boisterous marketing material, but Fathom's claims are much harder to verify, and some are probably wrong (e.g. their claim that user hashes – which correspond to your IIDs – were already anonymous).\n\nI might find the time later this year to implement a similar tool, though with different security and deployment assumptions (e.g. I really want to get rid of daily keys, and would like to use more probabilistic approaches in order to provide formal security guarantees. And I loathe anything cloud-native). If I do it, I'll drop you a link.",

So there needs to be consent involved in the cookie banners as well, for a lot of the processing to be possible. This even applies to processing where no personal data is involved, as it's the cookie itself you consent to. No legitimate interest allowed here.\n\nSo if it's possible to process user personal data without the use of technologies as cookies, legitimate interest should theoretically be a valid option and so companies will rely on this when the user does not consent.\n\nAs for its validity, well... there are a lot of things companies use the data for, and a lot of complicated processes and interests involved. It's doubtful that a user can even be considered \"adequately informed\" as per their rights, just reading away in the cookie banner. It's also doubtful whether it's clear to the user that \"legitimate interest\" is even a thing, and what it even entails. Then again, what else could companies rely on? Consent *also* requires the user to be properly informed, so if it's still too complicated for the average person, then would that even be an option? It's an ongoing debate and I do expect there will be a lot of changes in the coming years one way or the other.\n\nBut the TL;DR is this:\n\nLegitimate Interest is the legal purpose companies rely on when consent is out of the question, for any processing that does not explicitly require consent.",

For ePrivacy, it doesn't matter whether the information is personal data – this is about device-level privacy.\n\nYes trying to use analytics without consent is a hassle currently.

Since cookies or LocalStorage are stored on the user's device, setting cookies generally requires consent. Analytics are not strictly necessary for displaying a website.\n\nIt is only access to information on a device that matters here, not whether such information is combined with other identifiers. Thus, cookie consent is still necessary when truncating the IP address.\n\nTwo of the three sites you link (nomadlist, actualbudget) don't even seem to have a privacy policy – though there might be an argument that they are not subject to GDPR and ePrivacy. Analytics compliance *is* a concern for GDPR & ePrivacy compliance, but it has comparatively low priority (also low priority for supervisory authorities). Improper cookie consent is very very common, including here on Reddit.\n\nSo what should you do?\n\n* Collecting data is a liability. Limit data collection to what is actually necessary. Some kinds of analytics (e.g. counting pageviews) are possible without using cookies or IP addresses.\n* Concentrate on GDPR compliance for your core business activities. In particular:\n  * think through basic compliance questions for your processing activities: what is the purpose of processing, what is the Art 6 legal basis for processing, and what is the minimal amount of data necessary to achieve the purpose?\n  * write a privacy policy (see Art 13, Art 15 GDPR)\n  * make sure subcontractors are bound as data processors as appropriate (Art 28 GDPR), including sorting out international transfers\n  * take appropriate steps to ensure security of processing, including general infosec best practices and making backups\n* If you have time, consider sorting out non-essential activities. E.g. chat widgets on a website are currently very popular, but sorting out compliance can be more effort than they are worth.\n\nAnalytics are tricky because some analytics are often business-essential, whereas large amounts of data collected by common analytics solutions are entirely superfluous. But I think GA can be configured appropriately with reasonable effort. For example, these steps might contribute:\n\n* enable IP anonymization\n* deactivate cookie storage unless you want to implement a consent solution\n  * how to do that depends on how you load GA, here's the guide for analytics.js: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookies-user-id#disabling_cookies\n  * gtag.js has similar functionality under the `client_storage` config key, but this is undocumented\n* implement an opt-out solution, potentially accessible through your privacy policy (it's fine to use cookies to remember an opt-out: strictly necessary)\n* sign the DPA and SCCs in the GA settings\n* DO NOT enable data sharing with Google, such as for demographic data\n* if you have time, consider implementing opt-in to cookies, taking into account the conditions for consent in Art 7 GDPR\n  * if you're a web developer, doing this yourself is likely better than using a third party provider, unless you also want to show ads on your website\n* document the use of analytics in your privacy policy, perhaps using legitimate interest or consent as the legal basis (depending on whether you actually collect consent)\n\nYou do not have to show a cookie banner as mere notification, but you might use banners with a yes/no button in order collect consent. If you do, consider a “layered approach” that shows essential information right there in the banner so that visitors can make an informed choice, but also link to your full privacy policy.",

Under the GDPR definition, consent must be an unambiguous, affirmative action. Continuing to use a site is not unambiguous. Also, pre-ticked checkboxes aren't OK (see the Planet 49 case mentioned elsewhere). Finally, consent must be specific to a purpose, so a user should be able to consent or decline consent for analytics separately from ad personalization or whatever.\n\nSo unfortunately, if you want consent you will need to show a banner or other user interface element, and will have to provide an actual choice. Since this messes with your bounce rate and data quality, I'd suggest considering cookie-less analytics.\n\nYou're correct that the vast majority of sites has dubious to flat out illegal cookie consent practices, but as I mentioned this is not a priority for anyone. But this complacency is dangerous as it opens up liability.\n\nData processing agreements are not optional, but a very crucial compliance step when outsourcing data processing activities. Sometimes they are part of normal service contracts, often they require ticking a checkbox in an admin panel. If they don't offer a DPA they're probably trash anyway. If your startup wants to sell B2B services, offering a DPA to customers is just as important as having a VAT ID.\n\nFor your privacy policy, you may want to go through Art 13 and Art 15 of the GDPR, as they almost contain a checklist of required items. E.g. you should enumerate the data subject rights (access, erasure, portability, …) even if they don't apply. The UK's ICO also offers very good guides, even though they're no longer part of the EU.\n\nI'm not a lawyer but more of a dev as well, so I understand how overwhelming compliance can be. The good news is that GDPR compliance requires a one-time effort to write a privacy policy etc, but then has acceptably low cost going forward (e.g. starting to use a new subcontractor? Ok, sign the usual DPA with them and potentially update your privacy policy, done). In the end, this is just a part of doing business, like sales or taxes.",

There's an older EU law called the ePrivacy directive (the “cookie law”) that essentially said: cookies are small files stored on the end user's computer. Software shouldn't freely access the files on your computer, unless it's strictly necessary for a service you explicitly requested, or if you've given your consent. That's quite reasonable by itself. Then GDPR came along, and re-defined what “consent” means. Originally, it was planned to update ePrivacy to account for these changes, but agreement couldn't be reached in time (and the update is *still* not done).\n\nSo we have a weird combination of strict ePrivacy requirements (cookies usually require consent) and strict GDPR definitions (consent must be freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous and must involve a statement or clear affirmative action). Usually, GDPR is fairly flexible, but this specific combination lacks any nuance – not all cookies are equally problematic. For example, a cookie used to count the numbers of visitors to a page is far less sensitive than a cookie used for tracking you across different web sites in order to create an ad targeting profile.\n\nI hope that the ePrivacy regulation will be done soon so that the cookie law falls in line with the more flexible GDPR approach. But in the meanwhile:\n\n* Many sites manipulate and trick you in order to get you to click “accept all”. I won't let them win, and will try extra hard to decline consent, or to ignore and circumvent them.\n* Practicing digital self-defense prevents many problematic aspects of cookies on a technical levels. Disable third-party cookies in your browser settings. Firefox has much stronger privacy controls than Chrome, e.g. with its “Enhanced Tracking Protection” feature which you should enable in all tabs. The uBlock Origin adblocker is not the prettiest but the best on a technical level, especially when used with Firefox (Chrome-based browsers limit what adblockers can do).",

However, the post is not actually about these > requirements but about feelings regarding these requirements, > so it's not necessarily a good post.\n\nI don't see how this post relates to the cookie consent requirements, at all. It isn't being asked about in the post, nor is it discussed anywhere in this thread. Apart from your post - where you provide a very thorough and thoughtful response, although not asked for by OP.\n\nAnd in this thread I also don't see how it is about feelings regarding said requirements, the only thing that is mentioned by OP is that they find cookie *notices* annoying, and whether someone is ever rushed and pushes accepts. This doesn't without any further information relate to cookie consent requirements at all. A cookie notice can also just be, simply a cookie notice, without asking consent for anything under ePrivacy, but simply to comply with information obligations. Accepting is not the same thing as consent, and consent can't be implied from any information out of this thread.\n\n>This subreddit is about GDPR (and related regulation), not about legal advice. Of course, a lot of discussion does revolve about spreading an understanding of the impact of these regulations. If you're here for legal discussion you'll find a lot of them, but it's OK if some posts are not to your liking.\n\nThis post is not about GDPR, ePrivacy or anything else that is within scope. You are assuming it is. Discussions about GDPR, ePrivacy or any other law that is within scope automatically is a legal discussion; it is about the law and thus a legal discussion.\n\nThis post simply isn't about any law, it's only asking about feelings; and not even feelings about consent requirements, simply feelings.\n\nI take your point about the VPN, but I do not agree that this question is related to the European regulatory environment. Based on objective factors I simply cannot conclude that it is. The question is also way better fitted on another subreddit, like r/europrivacy.\n\n>I agree. This is spam in the sense of indiscriminate spread, though not spam in the sense of advertisements. If this were another platform, I might have the ability to merge these duplicates or to edit the question to be more topical (e.g. [Law.StackExchange.com](https://Law.StackExchange.com)).\n\nAlthough posting the same low effort post in many subreddits is spam in itself is not an reason to remove a post - that factored together with it being low effort, not related to any law in scope, or only barely related when you start assuming a hell lot of stuff, should satisfy the requirements for deletion, in my opinion. Furthermore, from what I gather from OP with the exact same post in other subreddits is really just that OP is looking for a solution such as an browser plugin that blocks them, is just another pointer that it is out of scope. \n\nI get your reasoning in regards to how you moderate the subreddit, but voting simply is not a good way of measuring the community's preferences. At the time of writing my comment has -12 points, it could very well be that 20 people upvoted it and 32 people downvoted it. It's not an objective way of measurement in my opinion.\n\nIn my opinion, posts should be substantive, not low effort. That together with the fact that it is not, or merely borderline within scope should be enough for deletion.\n\nBut you are the moderator, and I am not. Your call is final - and I'll have to accept that.",

The privacy policy lawyer required me to catalog all cookies used. However, I came across a situation that puzzled me. A few week ago, using the browser development tools (chrome and safari) I noticed that the presence of fifteen or more cookies, while at other times they seemed to disappear completely. This discrepancy also occurs when I check from different devices and can persist for weeks despite the cookie expiration date being years. I have tried to scan the site with various cookie scanning tools but can only detect one cookie and other times none. Recently, I asked the support of my hosting service to run a check, they identified about twenty cookies, all of which disappeared within a few minutes. I requested a re-verification today and they only found one. I even changed my browser settings to accept all cookies as I thought it was my problem, but that didn't solve the mystery of these fluctuations. I no longer know which cookies to include in the privacy policy at this point. Does anyone have any idea what I can do to fix it? A thousand thanks.",

Any information given is at-will and posted to a big public list (these vehicles are limited production, and numbered). \n\nI have a privacy policy set up, and have Google AdSense approved and running with a general cookie notice (accept/choose/deny all) which is GDPR compliant. Been running it like this for a while, but people are asking me why I have such precautions in place due to the fact I don't actually save/use personal info, and shouldn't need all the notices when visiting the site. \n\nIs there a way to get AdSense to run non-targeted ads that don't require cookie usage? If cookies ARE required (which I think they are), does that still require GDPR notices, even if no personal info is used and generic ads are run? \n\nI'm only running a banner or two, to offset the cost of the domain yearly. Not a massive site by any means, but we have users worldwide and I'd like to abide by the rules.

La gestion d’un site web ou d’une application requiert presque systématiquement l’utilisation de statistiques de fréquentation et/ou de performance. Ces mesures sont dans de nombreux cas indispensables au bon fonctionnement du site ou de l’application et donc à la fourniture du service. En conséquence, la Commission considère que les traceurs dont la finalité se limite à la mesure de l’audience du site ou de l’application, pour répondre à différents besoins (mesure des performances, détection de problèmes de navigation, optimisation des performances techniques ou de l’ergonomie, estimation de la puissance des serveurs nécessaires, analyse des contenus consultés, etc.) sont strictement nécessaires au fonctionnement et aux opérations d’administration courante d’un site web ou d’une application et ne sont donc pas soumis, en application de l’article 82 de la loi « Informatique et Libertés », à l’obligation légale de recueil préalable du consentement de l’internaute. \n\n51. Afin de se limiter à ce qui est strictement nécessaire à la fourniture du service, la Commission souligne que ces traceurs doivent avoir une finalité strictement limitée à la seule mesure de l’audience sur le site ou l’application pour le compte exclusif de l’éditeur. Ces traceurs ne doivent notamment pas permettre le suivi global de la navigation de la personne utilisant différentes applications ou naviguant sur différents sites web. De même, ces traceurs doivent uniquement servir à produire des données statistiques anonymes, et les données à caractère personnel collectées ne peuvent être recoupées avec d’autres traitements ni transmises à des tiers, ces différentes opérations n’étant pas non plus nécessaires au fonctionnement du service.",

I might consent to cookies for convenience features and analytics, while rejecting cookies for ad targeting purposes.\n\nIn any case, cookies must be opt-in: they can only be set *after* the visitor has given their consent. The exception to this are cookies that are strictly necessary for providing the service explicitly requested by the user. For example, using a cookie to store contents of a “shopping cart” is perfectly fine since that's strictly necessary for a webshop to work – but ads are not strictly necessary.\n\nBecause many sites are not compliant with GDPR and ePrivacy, I recommend taking additional precautions on your own.

In practice, yes.\n\n“[Contracts of adhesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_form_contract#Contracts_of_adhesion)” like most terms of service are a “take it or leave it” document that create a large imbalance between the company/drafter and the consumer. Thus, many countries are going to have consumer protection laws that state you can't sneak anything surprising in there.\n\nThe GDPR concept of “consent” tries to avoid these problems. Consent is defined to be a “freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her” (Art 4(11) GDPR). And per Art 7(2), requests for consent must be clearly distinguishable from other matters – they cannot be hidden in a larger document.\n\nHere, the relevant aspect is that consent must be specific, informed, and unambiguous. If the data subject doesn't know what they consented to, then the consent wasn't sufficiently informed and is therefore *invalid*. If consent is sought for multiple distinct purposes, a “consent to all” button might also be too unspecific and too ambiguous for obtaining valid consent. The very first layer of a consent flow should directly summarize the purposes for which consent is sought.\n\nSo far, the theory.\n\nIn practice, consent management tools are not just used for cookie consent, but for a variety of processing purposes ranging from fairly harmless analytics cookies, to more invasive ad personalization, cross-site tracking, embedding third party content, and sometimes even international data transfers. These tools are so complex that there's almost certainly something hidden in there that user's wouldn't expect when clicking on “accept all”. So it's quite likely that a lot of sneaky things are being done here.\n\nFor further details on how GDPR consent is supposed to work, consider reading the [EDPB guidelines on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en). Section 3.3 of that document discusses when consent is sufficiently informed. If you're in the UK, the [ICO website includes guidelines on consent](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/what-is-valid-consent/).\n\nWhile cookies and similar technologies always require consent because the ePrivacy Directive (UK: PECR) says so, other processing activities might not need consent. For example, data processing is also legal if it is necessary for fulfilling a contract with the data subject. Notably, Facebook attempted the argument that per its terms of service (that Facebook had written itself), Facebook was contractually bound to deliver personalized ads to users. How convenient, since this avoided the need to ask users for consent. But this is not a good argument. As mentioned, terms of service cannot contain surprising terms. Immediately when the GDPR came into force, NOYB initiated complaints against this. Back in 2019, and presumably in reaction to the NOYB cases, the [EDPB published guidelines on the use of contractual necessity as a legal basis](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-22019-processing-personal-data-under-article-61b_en), pointing out that something doesn't just become necessary for providing a service just because a contract says so. But, according to a [NOYB update from 2021](https://noyb.eu/en/irish-dpc-greenlights-facebooks-gdpr-bypass), the Irish DPC doesn't feel like following the EDPB's guidelines :)",

To comply with the GDPR you need to have some internal documents and procedures however, for which companies tend to hire legal advisors. I guess this type of service starts at ~500€, but can easily exceed it. \n\nBut it's quite easy to do yourself. Read a few GDPR compliance guides and checklists and you should have a reasonable understanding of what's expected. You basically need to:\n- describe your goals and justify what personal data you're processing and why\n- do a privacy impact assessment\n- appoint a GDPR compliance officer\n- create internal data protection policies and ensure everybody with access understands internal and legal requirements \n- create procedures for requesting and exporting, updating and removal of your customers data and describe them in your privacy policy (these functions can be automated but you can also point them to an email address)\n- create procedures to notify authorities and subjects in case of a data breach\n- sign data processing agreements with 3rd parties if they process personal information or if you're processing their data\n\nIt might seem excessive but once you're used to the jargon it's fairly easy, and you can reuse 95% of it. Also don't forget to charge your customers for this, most SMBs only need to add a little info about their other/analog operations to all this to be compliant.\n\nAnd my final advice is to not go to deep or worry to much about it. Since you're a small player they won't audit you (I believe they only audit organizations with 50 or so employees or millions of revenue), and if they do they'll check if you're aware and have your documentation ready but probably won't scrutinize the actual implementation. I've been involved in fiscal audits and even then auditors usually are pretty understanding if they feel like you tried to comply and are willing to follow up on their feedback.",

The persons are still identifiable if this is only possible with the help of additional information from a third party. Being able to single out an individual in your data is already a kind of identification. It is necessary to consider “all the means reasonably likely to be used”. What is reasonably likely to be used depends only on objective factors like available technology and costs, not on internal policies or promises “we would never do that”.\n\nAs a system maintainer you likely have access to large amounts of additional information that you could link to the internal IDs if you wanted to, for example network identifiers or user authentication credentials. If you don't have this information yourself, another third party might hold the link between the real identities and your internal IDs. Even without such direct means, the information linked to an ID could disclose aspects of the “economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.\n\nIn practice, very very little information is truly anonymous – it's difficult to escape the reach of the GDPR that way.

        "selftext": "Hi. It's the second time I post here. I've made a lot of research since then but still can't quite understand how the end user could tell if a website's cookie policy breaks the GDPR.\n\nThird party cookies, other than strictly necessary ones, require a user's consent (ePrivacy). Also, if the cookie contains a unique identifier, it needs to be treated as personal data, and therefore also requires a consent (GDPR). Advertising companies assign unique identifiers to publisher's website users via these cookies so they can create a user profile and display more relevant ads.\n\nNow, let's say that a website has no cookie banners (doesn't ask for consent) and still allows ad-related third party cookies to be installed in the end user's browser. The cookie is called 'ID', comes from an advertising company domain and contains a string of random lettes. Obviously this breaks the ePrivacy rule about consent to cookies that are not strictly necessary and it's easy to spot. But how can I tell if this string of random letters is my own identifier? It could very well mean nothing and just be random letters, how to prove that it actually goes against the GDPR?\n\nOne more thing. There is a website called [2gdpr.com](https://2gdpr.com) that automatically scan your website looking for ePrivacy/GDPR breaches. I've \"scanned\" many popular urls and it took me a while to find one that has all the 5 check fields green. It's quite worrying but at the same time, how are websites getting away with it? Is \"legitimate interest\" basically a get out of jail card?\n\nThanks for your answers in advance.",

Consent is only one possibly condition out of six that allows personal data to be processed lawfully. Consent is not necessary in general to process data.\n\nIn this particular situation, since we're already talking about non-essential cookies which require consent because of ePD, then you'll probably use consent for other processing. It's not necessarily impossible to use a different legal basis for that processing, but it's difficult and awkward.\n\n> But how can I tell if this string of random letters is my own identifier? It could very well mean nothing and just be random letters, how to prove that it actually goes against the GDPR?\n\nThe company is obligated to inform you of the purpose and meaning of the cookies. If you don't already know, then it's a GDPR violation for insufficient transparency, regardless of what they're actually using it for.\n\nTo find out more, send a Data Subject Access Request (per Article 15) asking what data is associated with that identifier. I could have sworn that GDPR includes an obligation to follow through with DSARs on pseudonymous identifiers, but I can't find it write now; perhaps it's a court interpretation of the obligation to \"facilitate\" such requests.\n\nIt's not possible in general to know the semantic meaning of an arbitrary string of characters. The same numeric code could be a personal identifier in one system, and the SKU of an item in your cart on another system. I don't trust fully-automated systems to be complete in this regard.\n\n> how are websites getting away with it?\n\nData protection authorities are under-resourced and have to pick their battles.",

For instance, the Google Analytics cookies are first party, meaning they're set by the website provider. But Google Analytics itself is a third party tool using Google Servers to store data, so Google becomes a processor in that regard.\n\nAlso, regarding the GA cookies: Statistics is *not* a strictly necessary purpose in the legal cookie sense, though some choose to ignore this if it's simple, website statistics. However, a big point against this would be that Google Analytics has recently been put into question by certain DPA's as not being compliant in regards to third country transfers. So if the website wanted to say \"it's just simple statistics\" the very fact that they're using GA is an argument against this.\n\nHowever: Legitimate Interest is an \"opt-out\" option, as consent is not factored here. It's fine to have these boxes pre-checked, assuming everything else about it is legal. It does, however, seem like the consent solution is built around the TCF, which has recently also been ousted by the Belgian DPA, so there's a lot of legal uncertainty there as well.",

Hell, IMO buttons such as 'accept all' are violating GDPR if:\n- the user can click them without having to see the list of third-parties and whatnot (because they cannot give informed consent until then)\n- the user cannot chose which third-parties to allow and must consent to all in bulk (meaning consent is not specific)\n\nSo yeah, IMO to comply with GDPR you need a big ass cookie modal/panel with a list of all your 142 third-party 'partners' with a link to their privacy policy and the user must be able to pick what he wants to consent to. Problem:\n- that's annoying as hell, your user is here for your service/content, not for this shit, that's why solutions like uBlock Origin are so popular\n- to not make it annoying as hell you can hide the modal/panel until the user clicks on it, but as I said earlier it means 99% of your users won't even glance at it, because in the end they don't need nor want your tracking, you do",

E.g. Google has taken the polar opposite approach with the Massive Cookie Modal (that's definitely not ambiguous haha). Design-wise, I quite like the ICO's own approach (https://ico.org.uk/). Works well on desktop, but interestingly, on mobile, their whole 'non-ambiguous' approach goes out the window imo :P\n\nOut of interest, if you are in dev/design, are you a 'massive cookie modal' person or a 'subtle cookie acceptance approach' person?",

Imo, its far better to use API data. Even if that means building out APIs for collecting data on button clicks and some other 'custom events' that data people like to track in Google Analytics etc.\n\nFirstly,  imo - that's not unambiguous for a customer. If you're filling and submitting a form on a site, you are explicitly giving your data to that company. Equally, if you click 'Submit', naturally the website owners know you clicked 'Submit'.\n\nSecondly, the data is accurate (no ad-blockers etc). If a customer interacts with a service, they have to use the API.  \n\nI've never really understood the point of cookies (apart from the 'that's what we've always used for collecting analytics data' mantra)",

It's a content marketing site, and the quality of its advice is uneven at best. \n\nI would like to request that you edit your comment to remove the link to them, as that link contributes (via Google's algorithm) to the false impression that they are authoritative.\n\nA cookie is \"strictly necessary\" if it is needed to perform the service requested by the user. I'm not sure there's explicit official guidance, but generally I treat \"service\" as pretty fine-grained. If the user clicks a lang preference button, they are requested the service of language personalization, and a cookie is needed for that service. Note that the cookie needs to be *mentioned* in your cookie/privacy policy, but you don't need separate consent.\n\nYou can't pre-emptively load cookies for services/features that a user *might* request. The classic example (used by multiple regulators) is chat services. Most users don't use the chat service, you can't load cookies for a chat service *until* the user takes an affirmative action towards using the chat service (like clicking the \"Chat\" link).\n\nFollowing this logic, the \"default\" values for cookies should be to not exist, as opposed to existing with a null-ish value. So don't set a \"cart=[]\" cookie as soon as someone visits the site. The cart cookie shouldn't exist until someone adds to cart. \n\nThis gets a little more complicated if the only client-side cookie is a session ID, and the lang & cart values are stored server-side.",

It is also necessary to make it possible to decline consent, without detriments to the data subject. Making content inaccessible without consent would likely be noncompliant. Consent also has to be informed and specific – you have to give enough information about the cookies used that they can make an informed decision, and they should be able to consent to one purpose but not another (e.g. analytics yes but marketing no).\n\nTo some degree, this is the fault of the EU. The requirement to ask for consent for all cookies is excessive. The ePrivacy Directive which introduced the cookie consent requirement was supposed to be updated together with the GDPR, but since about three years there hasn't been any progress.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you will have to use a cookie consent banner. But since a compliant banner will make it easy to decline consent, you will get somewhat useless data. A possible alternative is to use analytics without cookies/LocalStorage, so that no consent is required. But that means you can't track sessions across pages.",

Clearly, ticking a checkbox is one possible way how a data subject can unambiguously indicate their wishes. This section says that browsers or other software can manage consent as well.\n\nBut this does not affect the conditions for consent, especially Art 7 GDPR. In particular: consent must be specific and informed. It is not possible to consent to “cookies”. Consent should relate to a particular *purpose* instead.   With common browsers, the only choice users have is “allow all cookies” vs “block third party cookies”. But there are no options to make choices like “allow cookies if they are strictly necessary, or if they are used solely for analytics purposes, or if they are set by twitter.com, but block any other cookies”.\n\nIn some cases, browsers do offer suitable consent management. E.g. if a website wants to access your camera, microphone, or location information, you'll get a consent popup from your browser. Similar features are integrated into mobile operating systems. Per the quoted PECR part, that is a potentially valid mechanism to manage consent.\n\nNevertheless, consent must be informed. These browser-supported consent mechanisms do not typically provide enough context to make an informed decision, so I don't think they are generally sufficient for valid consent by themselves.\n\nThe Web does not currently have suitable technologies through which websites can indicate for which purposes they use a cookie or other features, and have no way to provide information necessary for an informed decision. Well, other than the classic way of showing a cookie banner.\n\n> To my (uneducated) eyes, this reads that if a browser settings are configured to *accept* cookies (as is the default) that this is good enough for consent under PECR.\n\nNope, that does not look like it would fulfil the conditions for valid consent. A default setting can never constitute consent because there was no “clear affirmative action” by the data subject.",

                "body": "P.S.: Incidentally, this is why the Do Not Track standard sank. Browsers can indicate to websites whether the users wishes to be tracked. This setting has three states (yes/no/indeterminate). Next to no websites use this information because it isn't clear what “do not track” is supposed to mean, and since there is no legal obligation to honour it. But if this setting was present, it at least was an unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes. Then Internet Explorer 10 decided to activate DNT *by default*. This caused the tracking industry to essentially say: oh no, we don't know if the user *really* wanted to ~opt-out from tracking~ *get less relevant ads*, so we'll better ignore this setting. Thus, DNT became even less relevant.\n\nThe Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a more recent iteration on this idea with only two states (privacy signal/indeterminate). Unlike DNT, it received some legal backing: it is a valid *and binding* “do not sell my personal information” signal under the CCPA. But I have severe doubts whether this can have any effect in a GDPR context. The GPC draft spec (2021-12-16) says:\n\n> The GDPR requires that \"Natural persons should have control of their own personal data\" ([GDPR], Recital 7). The GPC signal is intended to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user's personal data to other data controllers ([GDPR] Articles 7 & 21). This request is expressed with every interaction that the user agent has with the server.\n>\n> Note that this request is not meant to withdraw a user's consent to local storage as per the ePrivacy Directive (\"cookie consent\") ([EPRIVACY-DIRECTIVE]) nor is it intended to object to direct marketing under legitimate interest ([GDPR]).\n\nSo essentially: it would be nice if this causes websites to do some privacy-positive things, but it's totally unclear what it's supposed to mean (except that it doesn't affect consent status).",

                "body": "You are in essence asking if illegally collected data can be used legally. I think this is a tricky question that also depends on what other lawful use is being proposed. In some cases, it may be possible to argue that the two processing activities are separate so that failing to obtain a valid legal basis for one activity doesn't affect the other. But in general, it will be difficult to argue that illegally acquired data can be used legally. Consent does not allow use for a different purpose, and failing to obtain required consent must not result in more rights to the controller. I also think that a legitimate interest balancing test would generally fail in such a context.\n\n## Breaking the law can't be better than adhering to it.\n\nFirst, lets consider what happens if valid consent had been obtained, as is legally required in the case of analytics cookies. Per the purpose limitation principle in GDPR Art 5(1)(b),\n\n> Personal data shall be […] collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes\n\nIf personal data is collected for purpose A we can only use it for purpose A, or a purpose B if B is compatible with A. Art 6(4) provides criteria to determine whether two purposes are compatible. But these criteria do not apply when the legal basis was consent. **Consent is always specific to a purpose**, so there cannot be a compatible purpose outside of consent (though I would argue that vital interests and legal obligations could override the consent purpose limitation).\n\nBreaking the law must not produce more beneficial outcomes than adhering to it. If consent is legally required, then failing to obtain consent cannot allow more uses of the data than if everything had been done by the book.\n\n## Separate legal bases for separate purposes.\n\nBut here the crux is that we must consider for what consent has been obtained. The ePrivacy directive (and national implementations like the PECR) require consent for accessing or storing information on the end user's device, where such access or storage is not strictly necessary to perform a service explicitly requested by the end user. In the context of analytics, we need consent to store a pseudonymous client ID on the end users device, for example by placing a cookie. We arguably also need consent to access JavaScript APIs for collecting analytics metrics, such as screen size or collecting data for fingerprinting.\n\nWhereas we need consent for placing cookies and collecting analytics data, we don't necessarily need that consent for subsequent processing of the data. It may be possible to argue that these are distinct processing activities that can be covered by separate legal bases. Then, a failure to obtain a valid legal basis for activity A might not affect the legality of activity B.\n\n## Deletion obligations when data has been processed unlawfully.\n\nAnother wrinkle in this matter is that unlawfully processed data should be deleted. To my surprise the GDPR doesn't say that if data has been collected illegally, then it must be deleted. Instead, data subjects can request erasure if their data has been processed unlawfully (Art 17(1)(d)), and supervisory authorities can order deletion (Art 58(2)).\n\n## Legitimate interest balancing test.\n\nWhen claiming a legitimate interest, it is necessary to perform a suitable balancing test that weighs the claimed legitimate interest against the rights and freedoms of the affected persons. Per Recital 47, criteria for this balancing test include “the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller”. If the data controller is performing a processing activity for which a data subject would reasonably expect a consent request first, it will be difficult to show that a legitimate interest exists.\n\n## Counterexamples\n\nThe GDPR has broad exemptions from the purpose limitation principle for “archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes”, subjects to safeguards per Art 89. Analytics tend to involve statistics so maybe there's an argument here, but at least Google Analytics allows way too fine-grained profiling for its reports to benefit from this exemption.\n\nI can also imagine scenarios (outside of the analytics context) where there is a strong legitimate interest to process unlawfully obtained data. For example, I'd argue that the HIBP data breach notification service is not prohibited by the GDPR from processing leaked and breached data. This is similar in that most data used by HIPB has become available by illegal means, but dissimilar in that the illegal and legal processing activities have been undertaken by different controllers.",

Or do they consider the severity of the case in question and assess the punishment from there? I am having trouble finding case studies and examples.\n\nI appreciate this is a GDPR subreddit and that a significant proportion of readers will take the customer's stance on this, but if anybody can objectively recommend what to do next or what outcome I should realistically expect I'd really appreciate it.\n\nIs it more likely a warning and being told to make sure it doesn't happen again, or more likely a hefty fine, or something in between?\n\nNeedless to say, the 'show cookie banner' setting is now definitely switched on properly! Thank you for any advice.",

It doesn't even matter if that information is personal data.\n\nCookies that are needed for securely running the site and for providing the features used by the user are sometimes called “functional” cookies, but that is not a term used by the law itself. Typical examples for cookies that might not need consent include rate limiting cookies, CSRF tokens, session cookies for logged-in users, remembering user preferences like cookie consent status, language, or theme, and features like shopping carts.\n\nIn the web browser, examples of technologies for accessing or storing information on the device include cookies, LocalStorage, but also other JavaScript APIs and fingerprinting techniques.\n\nIn mobile apps, there are generally far more ways to access information on the device or to store info on the device. Examples include files or databases, but also advertising IDs, cameras, or the APIs provided by the operating system. The operating system might force you to ask for consent for some of those (e.g. permissions for location data or camera), but that doesn't affect your legal obligations.\n\nSo I think your colleague is mostly wrong, with a bit of truth. The consent requirements are exactly the same on mobile and web. If you'd need consent on web, you'd definitely need consent on mobile when using similar technologies. However, it is entirely feasible that your app might only access/store data as strictly necessary to provide the service explicitly requested by the user, so that no consent would be needed.",

Without session cookies, you'd have to enter your username and password every single time you wanted to load a page or subpage.

The **session cookie** is the \"keep this\" half, and is kept by your browser. The number on it is your **session ID**. The other half of the ticket, Facebook keeps: they stamp it with an expiration date (today + 30 days, for example), and staple it to your account.\n\nThe next time you access Facebook, instead of punching in your password again, your browser auto-presents the session cookie (your raffle ticket). Facebook sees a matching ticket in its database, confirms your identity, pulls up your account, and hands you the webpage you asked for, filled with information specific to your user. This works until the ticket expires, or you sign out (rip the ticket up).

For example, website data may be cached for better efficiency.\n* The storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by you. For example, cookies to store preferences or session cookies are strictly necessary.\n* You have given your consent.\n\nFor strictly necessary cookies, you don't have to be asked for consent. Without these cookies the site will break, so it's acceptable to block your access should you disable these.\n\nBut when cookies shall be set on the basis of consent, this consent must be freely given. Art 7(4) GDPR says that consent is typically not freely given if the website makes access to a service conditional on consent. This is also what that DPA guy on the phone said to you.\n\nFacebook is pretty bad about this. When you visit a Facebook property, you're asked to accept cookies:\n\n[Fig 1: Instagram cookie banner level 1.](https://imgur.com/Fp32V3x.png)\n\nNo “reject non-essential” option is given.\n\n[Fig 2: Instagram cookie banner level 2.](https://i.imgur.com/0hlUZEF.png)\n\nThe banner explains that some cookies are essential. However, it also says that cookies are used for showing relevant ads, which is not strictly necessary for the service that I requested (viewing a profile). The only control is over third-party cookies, which is probably not sufficient.  \nBelow the fold, links point to browser cookie management features such as Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection. Again, probably not sufficient: the data controller cannot outsource the responsibility for consent management to third parties.\n\nIn my opinion, FB's cookie banner is not compliant because FB wants to set cookies that are not strictly necessary for a service requested by the user, without obtaining valid consent. The “accept all” button fails to achieve freely given consent because there is literally no option (other than removing the banner using browser developer tools).\n\nUnfortunately, the Irish Data Protection Commission is the primary regulator for Facebook, and they're not exactly cracking down on FB.\n\nI think that Reddit's cookie banner does a much better job and offers a real choice:\n\n[Fig 3: Reddit cookie banner level 1.](https://i.imgur.com/6ylgLG5.png)\n\nA “reject non-essential” option is directly given, which is very good.\n\nReddit also has a pretty reasonable [cookie notice](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/cookie-notice) ([permalink](https://web.archive.org/web/20211027151454/https://www.redditinc.com/policies/cookie-notice)) that clearly lists which strictly necessary cookies will be set, and for which purposes.",

If you don't want the cookie, it is not technically possible for you to login to a site.\n\nBTW, they don't store your password in a cookie.  The cookie will store a giant random number.  In the site, they will have a database entry saying something akin to <user, valid Y|N, large_number>.  When your browser loads a page, it sends the cookies along via fields in the HTTP request.

                "body": "The cited WP 29 guidelines are from 2007. Since then, a lot has happened. Especially the research on identifiability has made some important advances around that time. The old Data Protection Directive on which these guidelines are based are even older, and predate important scientific results.\n\nSo while those WP 29 guidelines are important and well-reasoned, they are not particularly authoritative regarding GDPR.\n\nWhile the DPD and GDPR share a lot of text, there are also some important differences. E.g. the GDPR mentions “singling out” as an example of identifying someone. The GDPR added “online identifier” as an example of an identifier.\n\nI interpret this as meaning that if you can single out an individual, that data subject is identifiable. A random identifier in a cookie clearly makes it possible to single out an individual. If two HTTP requests have the same cookie value, that implies they are from the same browser session, thus most likely from the same person. Similarly, IP addresses allow singling out in most cases (except in case of massive NAT deployments, e.g. IP addresses that connect a large intranet). These IP addresses or cookie identifiers are at the very least *pseudonyms* of the data subjects – but still personal.\n\nI note that my interpretation is in some contraction with the WP136 document, especially example 13. But that example has many additional aspects that ensure a level of anonymity. I don't think any DPAs or courts still doubt that cookie identifiers or IP addresses can constitute personal data.\n\nThe reference to “another person” is important in case the data is shared with others, or even published. If that data is anonymous, then *no one* who gets the data will be able to identify data subjects. If someone else can combine the data with additional data that allows re-identification, the data is not anonymous. So a data controller can't claim “*I* can't identify data subjects, so it's anonymous” and sell the “anonymous” data to others. In this context, the WP136 document also considers the storage duration – if the data is kept for a long time, future developments could make re-identification possible.",

                "body": "In the following, I will first discuss the Breyer ruling which introduces this “legal means” concept. I find that it is far broader than generally summarized. Subsequently, I will provide an argument that while Breyer establishes a lower bound on identifiability through IP addresses, its line of argument is not necessary under the GDPR: IP addresses are likely to be personal data regardless of legal means to obtain additional information. In particular, I will discuss the concept of “online identifiers” in more detail, will remark upon “singling out”, and will show that “reasonably likely to be used” should be interpreted broadly, excluding only means that are unreasonable. I finish with a remark on the ICO guide.\n\n## Discussion of the Breyer ruling\n\nTo my knowledge, there have not been any more recent ECJ rulings on identifiability through IP addresses than the Breyer ruling you're citing. That ruling is subsequently cited in more recent cases such as the Opinion of the Advocate General in the Fashion ID case, but there just to note that IP addresses *can be* personal data. Whether an IP address *is* personal data in that context would be for a lower court to decide, which hasn't done so yet.\n\nSpecifically, the judgement in Breyer mentions that if the data controller is reasonably likely to have means that allow them to combine non-identifying data with other data that allows identification, then this data is personal data. Here, the court notes that there would be such means:\n\n>  German law does not allow the internet service provider to transmit directly to the online media services provider the additional data necessary for the identification of the data subject[. However], in the event of cyber attacks legal channels exist so that the online media services provider is able to contact the competent authority, so that the latter can take the steps necessary to obtain that information from the internet service provider and to bring criminal proceedings.\n>\n> Thus, it appears that the online media services provider has the means which may likely reasonably be used in order to identify the data subject, with the assistance of other persons, namely the competent authority and the internet service provider, on the basis of the IP addresses stored.\n\nNote that this finding is in no way contingent on the “online media services provider” being the German government. It is also not necessary for identifiability that the data controller would receive the additional information itself. In the court's finding, it is sufficient if the re-identification is performed by a “competent authority”.\n\n## Limits of the Breyer ruling in light of changes between the DPD and GDPR\n\nHowever, I believe that the Breyer judgement is not entirely applicable under the GDPR. To be clear: it shows a lower bound on identifiability. If such legal means exist, the IP address is identifiable. This doesn't preclude that the IP address could also be identifying without such legal means.\n\nThe Breyer judgement says:\n\n> a dynamic IP address does not constitute information relating to an ‘identified natural person’, since such an address does not directly reveal the identity of the natural person who owns the computer from which a website was accessed, or that of another person who might use that computer.\n\n(and later discusses whether an IP address can be *indirectly identifying*, reaching the conclusion above.)\n\nI think this part is no longer as applicable, or at least misleading. IP addresses can be personal data without directly revealing the identity of a natural person.\n\n**First**, the GDPR explicitly added that **online identifiers** are an example of personal data. There is to date no case law on this term, so we only have Recital 30 to go on:\n\n> Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them.\n\nBoth “cookie identifiers” and “internet protocol addresses” are explicitly called out as examples of online identifiers. While there are obviously many cookie contents and IP addresses that are clearly not personal data, I think we should assume by default that they are at least indirectly identifying. It would be up to the data controller to demonstrate the opposite in the context of their processing activities.\n\n**Second**, the GDPR added “**singling out**” as an example of identification. You disagree with me on the interpretation of this term, but I think the GDPR consistently takes a comparatively wide view of identifiability. Let's look at Recital 26 again:\n\n> To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments.\n\nBoth the “singling out” and “To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely …” parts were added in the GDPR, and were not present in the old Data Protection Directive on which Breyer was based. There are some examples given as objective **factors that affect reasonableness**. These do not allow an overly narrow interpretation, instead requiring us to even consider future “technological developments”.\n\nI think this mandates a rather wide and risk-aware approach to identifiability, while merely excluding *unreasonable* scenarios like “a supervillain builds a $100M supercomputer cluster to crack the encryption” or “an ISP employee accidentally lost printouts with customer records in the back-alley behind a bar, where the data controller finds them and uses them for re-identification”. The referenced ICO guidance excludes scenarios with a “slight hypothetical possibility”. Prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or outright unlikely means do not have to be considered. However, the current intentions of the data controller would not seem to be a factor, e.g. if the controller merely intends to not use available techniques that would reasonably allow identification.\n\n## Regarding the ICO guide\n\nI agree that the same information can be personal data when processed for one purpose, and non-personal when processed for other purposes. However, this should not generally be argued over the “identified or identifiable” aspect, but over the “relating to [a] data subject” part. Note that those ICO guidelines also consider a data subject directly identified or identifiable if “you can distinguish an individual from other individuals”, i.e. if you're able to single out a subject. It is not necessary to know the data subject's real-world identity such as their name.",

The CNIL even provides an example of a cookie banner with similar buttons for “accept all”, “refuse all” and “personalize my choices.” \"",

(e.g. [Github](https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/)'s announcement that they are removing the cookie banner by virtue of removing all tracking beyond login cookies.)  For companies that do stalk their users, following the GDPR is as difficult as John Wick following a law against assassination.

The upside is that it it gives greater leeway to address violations of the spirit of the law, where a rigid pronouncement of methods would allow inventions of new dark patterns within those rigid boundaries.",

        "selftext": "Under the ePrivacy Directive the rules on cookies are relatively clear - cookies and \"other similar devices\" require consent unless they fall under the two narrow exemptions. According to the Art 29 WP these exemptions do not apply to analytics.\n\nMatomo claims to have an analytics solution that circumvents the consent requirement:  [https://matomo.org/faq/new-to-piwik/how-do-i-use-matomo-analytics-without-consent-or-cookie-banner/](https://matomo.org/faq/new-to-piwik/how-do-i-use-matomo-analytics-without-consent-or-cookie-banner/)\n\nThe proposed solution is to disable all tracking cookies. Matomo can still identify unique visits by logging \"IP address and other footprints\". \n\nMatomo suggests that no consent is required using this solution because:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*the data is not used for any other purpose than analytics (compared to GA which uses it for other purposes and therefore always requires consent)*  \n>  \n>*visitors aren’t tracked across websites (compared to GA which does track visitors across many websites)*  \n>  \n>*fingerprints change daily for every visitor meaning no visitor can be followed across days within the same website, and no user profiles can be generated when cookies are disabled*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, the IP address can be anonymized by deleting most octets.\n\nThese reasons appear flawed to me as according to the Art 29 WP:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Article 5(3)* \\[of the ePrivacy Directive\\] *applies to \"information\" (stored and/or accessed). It does not qualify such information. It is not a prerequisite for the application of this provision that this information is personal data within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC. Recital 24 captures the rationale of this approach by stating that \"terminal equipment of users…and any information stored on such equipment are part of the private sphere of these users requiring protection under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\".* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFundamentally, though, my question is whether this Matomo solution does indeed circumvent the need for consent because it does not use cookies, or whether this fingerprinting method would qualify as a \"similar device\" to cookies and thus fall within the scope of the ePrivacy Directive.",

I'm skeptical about their GDPR claims. Additionally, their statements about the functionality of GA have some factual errors.\n\n[ICO's cookie guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies/#cookies5) would imply that IP address (\"data exposed by the use of particular network protocols\") is covered by PECR and falls under the same regulation. You don't need consent to use IP address to serve a webpage because using the IP is \"strictly necessary\" for that service. However [analytics is explicitly called out](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-the-rules-on-cookies-and-similar-technologies/#rules10) as not meeting \"strictly necessary.\" Combined, these would indicate that Matomo is not exempt in ICO's opinion.\n\nOther regulators have more-or-less said that GA is OK. The Dutch regulator even has a guide on how to make GA compliant, which doesn't require too much beyond the out-of-the-box configuration (it's more focused on things *not* to do).\n\nRegarding specific claims:\n\n> the data is not used for any other purpose than analytics (compared to GA which uses it for other purposes and therefore always requires consent)\n\nFirst, analytics purposes requires consent according to some regulators. Second, GA can be used for analytics alone. I don't believe that the consent will depend on whether it *could* be used for other purposes, but whether it *actually is* used for other purposes. \n\n> visitors aren’t tracked across websites (compared to GA which does track visitors across many websites)\n\nBy default GA does not track across websites. There are configuration options that enable this, but again there's a difference between the *capability* and the *actual usage*.\n\nI'm also having trouble seeing why they believe you need to mention Matomo in your privacy policy, but claim that the data it processes doesn't count as personal data. That seems contradictory. If it's not personal data, then GDPR doesn't have any requirements to put it in your privacy policy; if it's in your privacy policy, it's because you believe it's personal data.\n\nUltimately if you have concerns I would run them by your *own* counsel rather than relying on Matomo's marketing material.",

The issue I have with Matomo's suggestion is that a daily changing fingerprint is still an identifier for that day, so that the GDPR's concept of anonymization is probably not fulfilled.\n\nWhether accessing device details with JavaScript to create a high-fidelity fingerprint is cookie-like is subject to debate, but the consensus seems to be that such fingerprints are equivalent to cookies when considering ePrivacy. I hope that a court would take a more nuanced approach, e.g. by making a distinction between technical data such as the screen resolution and invasive fingerprinting such as canvas fingerprinting, or extracting the list of installed fonts.\n\nI don't think that the use of JavaScript is a problem in itself.

As far as GDPR is concerned, I rely on *legitimate interest* as a legal basis. I support opt out via the Do Not Track header.

My issue seems a little nuanced so a second opinion would be great - though it might require some familiarity with  web dev. soooo....\n\nI am building a web-app. Users keep their anonymity - though are assigned an ID on registration (simply a 'BEGIN' button). They are asked a series of questions as they progress through the app, similar to a survey, with feedback given after each set of questions. \n\nThe questions relate to user experiences, though no combination of data points can be used to re-identify them. Answers are stored and attributed to a user ID. This allows us to recall answers later and give feedback. It will also allow us to give the user a password so they can recall their session at a later date. \n\nWe maintain that this data does not pertain to a users actual identity and we *only retain data that is necessary for our app to work*. Some of the collected answers are used for research, which is stated clearly in our Privacy Notice. The 'research' part is simply some automated graphs etc showing aggregate trends across answers. \n\nReferencing cookie law, our cookie banner offers users a choice to \n\n\t*i) Persist their login details locally so they can quickly resume there session easily on this device*\n\n\t*ii) opt in to Google Analytics*\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. The data we need for the app to work (arguably 'strictly necessary') is also used for internal research/reporting - two purposes, though we are fully transparent with our intentions. We highlight this both on the registration page and in our Privacy Notice. Both purposes are essential for the app to run, and \"opt-out\" is not really possible in this case. Does GDPR prevent us from generating reports from the data we collect? What is the correct way for us to ask them to agree to this on registration?\n2. By default no data is stored on the users computer, though a user ID is generated on registration and subsequent answers are sent to our server. I would like to persist the ID in localstorage so that the users session can be recalled when they return. Do I need the user to opt in to do this (i.e an option to consent within our cookie banner - above)? Can an \"accept all\" option be used? it is unlikely they will opt in at all if they have to configure each cookie individually with our cookie manager. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Forcing a decision is OK, but coercing the user to a particular outcome is not.\n\nBut there are two important caveats:\n\n1. Consent means opt-in. If the user hasn't indicated their preferences, you do not have consent. So by default, “do nothing” and “decline consent” should have equivalent effect. You must not prevent access to a user who doesn't want to consent. If you block scrolling, you can't already load stuff in the background that would need consent.\n\n2. Most ad networks still require cookies or similar technologies in order to measure click rates and to prevent ad fraud. Such ad networks will require consent even when just showing non-personalized ads.\n\nAlso, you may want to consider the impact of blocking user interactions depending on the purpose of the page. For example, adding such friction on a landing page where you are trying to sell a product would be extremely unwise. In such a scenario, it could be more valuable to increase the conversion rate than to have a bit of ad revenue.",

However, I've been running into an issue with the recent introduction of legitimate interest as a new category on many cookie consent banners. \n\nBased on existing legislation (ePrivacy, but also WP29 guidelines), legitimate interest should not serve as a fail-safe option to consent, is not viable for the collection of data when it comes to cookies, and would therefore only be possible for the stages of data processing after collection. If so, this should mean that if you fail to untick the legitimate interest boxes on cookie consent banners, but you have consent boxes unticked by default, no data could be collected. But then, if the answer is no, what is the use of providing this legitimate interest option from the get-go? \n\nDoes anyone here know whether this is the case and no data will be collected (as would be compliant with existing regulation), or are cookie banner providers actually using it as an alternative to consent?

If something looks problematic on a website's cookie banner, a very realistic possibility is that they done goofed and it's actually in violation of GDPR or ePD.\n\nHaving seen how the sausage gets made, there are a variety of contributing factors. A) companies assign the drafting or review of policies to their existing roster of lawyers which does not include relevant expertise, so it's someone who is out of their depth. B) after making a general policy, decision-making about some of the details gets handed down the chain to either a manager or consultant who projects more confidence than competence. C) There is a lot of difference to emulating peer companies, resulting in the blind leading the blind, or to the default settings for management tools, which for a variety of reasons actually default to non-compliance.\n\nLegitimate Interest is not a basis for cookie consent. Also the idea of \"a fail-safe option to consent\" is ill-founded. If consent is being asked for, that means that denying/withdrawing consent results in the data not being processed. It is a violation of GDPR to claim another Legal Basis when the user does not consent. \n\nAs a practical matter, even when the company *intends* not to collect data based on the user's settings, it's a bit of a coinflip on whether they successfully stop themselves from collecting the data. Website analytics and marketing analtyics tend to come into a website from a dozen different angles, and even a well-intentioned cookie banner roll-out is likely to have gaps in coverage.",

This is sometimes abused by non legal people who do not understand what functional/essential really means and might consider that analytics is essential to their business. That is true but irrelevant to the cookie being essential or not.\n\n2) LI is never an acceptable legal basis for cookies. In my experience, it is almost never used as a legal basis for cookies. You often see websites ignoring the user consent or dropping cookies before consent is given but never websites exposing LI for cookies.\n\nI know the cookie banner vendors out there pretty well and they would not support cookies based on LI for EU by default. Some of them might allow their clients to do it if they want but vendors will usually make it pretty clear that it's not acceptable. At the end of the day, the responsibility is with the client so the cookie banner vendors will allow non compliant configurations to happen.\n\n3) LI can be used for other data processing for websites/apps and is therefore offered for non-cookie based purposes pretty often.",

Indeed, this system could affect the freedom of consent, required by the GDPR.\n\n>In the decision of June 19, 2020, the Council of State ruled that the requirement for \"free\" consent could not, however, justify a general ban on the practice of \"walls of tracers\": the freedom of consent of individuals must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account, in particular, the existence of a real and satisfactory alternative offered in case of refusal of cookies. To take the most common example, the fact that an online press publisher makes access to its content conditional either on the acceptance of advertising cookies that contribute to the remuneration of its service, or on the payment of a reasonable sum of money, is not prohibited in principle, if the latter allows access to an equivalent version of the site in terms of content and totally devoid of advertising cookies Other elements, such as the dominant position of the site, may lead to the illegality of certain \"walls of cookies\".\n\n>The CNIL, which has already taken this latest decision into account in its guidelines, will continue its analysis in light of the Conseil d'Etat's ( State Council ) ruling to determine the cases justifying the presence of a wall of trackers in light of the alternatives available to the individual. The future European regulation known as \"e-privacy\", currently being drafted, could contribute to setting more precise rules in this area.\n\nSource - in French [CNIL](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookie-walls-et-monetisation-des-donnees-personnelles-les-enjeux-juridiques-et-ethiques#)",

This is generally correct, especially taking into account the later Fashion ID case.\n\n* The Law.SE question is specifically about cookie consent. In the Law.SE answer (which I wrote), I discussed who the data controller is with regards to the setting of cookies. Taking into account the Fashion ID case, I come to the conclusion that the embedding site and the embed provider are likely joint controllers. So while the embed provider is definitely responsible for cookie consent, the embedding site might also be responsible for managing consent.\n\nIn any case, cookies are a bit of red herring. You need a legal basis for sharing visitor data with the embed provider. This legal basis will typically be consent. That means:\n\n* instead of showing the embed, show a placeholder\n* only load the embed after the visitor has given their informed consent\n* the visitor should be aware that the embed is outside of your control, who the other data controller is (e.g. Youtube), that they might set cookies, and that the data might be transferred into the US.\n\nI've screenshotted a fairly good solution in [this Law.SE answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56006).

This doesn't just apply to e-commerce aspects (such as subtle differences between consumer rights) but also to aspects related to the ePrivacy Directive, such as cookies.\n\nThe catch is that not all laws that are on the books are valid. While a national law can clearly explain that creating statistics from traffic data is allowed, the ePrivacy directive does not give EU members the option to allow analytics cookies without consent. From your description, the law seems to clarify the former and doesn't do the latter. So that just seems to be a clarification of EU-wide rules, not an exemption specific to Italy. \n\nSpecifically:\n\n> we don't need to use a cookie prior consent banner if we only use Analytics in anonymous mode\n\nCorrect. The ePrivacy Directive (and implementing laws) mandate that you obtain consent before you store or access information (such as cookies) on the end user's device, unless the access is *strictly necessary* to perform a service *explicitly requested* by the user. Analytics only need consent to the degree that they involve such client-side storage or if they involve non-anonymous traffic data. ePrivacy explicitly allows you to use traffic data as long as it's made anonymous.\n\nCareful: typical analytics solution collect *a lot* of data, which may amount to an unique fingerprint. True anonymity is difficult to achieve without aggregate statistics.\n\n> there is a specific law that says you need to show in the cookie banner which kind of cookie categories you want to accept and give consent.\n\nCorrect, but this is a core feature of consent as defined by the GDPR (and thus applies EU-wide). Consent must be specific to a purpose, so the visitor must be able to give consent to one purpose/category but to withhold consent for another. Consent must also be informed, which means that you must give an appropriate level of information about what you're asking consent for.\n\nFor EU-wide guidance on consent, consider reading the [EDPB guidelines 05/2020 on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en) (PDF, about 30 pages).",

As such, the actual wording of the law is harmonised across all member states and ancillary members. Member states *can* \"gold plate\" laws by adding additional requirements (e.g. countries such as Spain and Germany have additional requirements for processing employee data).\n\n2. **Countries can take a different approach to GDPR, but this is lead by the guidance issued by the relevant DPAs and more broadly local courts** - Since there is still much up to interpretation, local DPAs and courts may make slightly different interpretations when it coems to issuing guidance and enforcing GDPR.\n\n3. **GDPR does not contain specific provisions on cookies** - Cookie requirements are contained in the e-Privacy directive. This, as opposed to a Regulation, is an EU legal act which *does* need to be implemented at a local level (e.g. see UK's PECR). This is why there are many different approaches to cookie walls in the EU, it simply isn't harmonised. GDPR does impact cookies, and you are correct in this part, but only insofar as the definition of \"explicit consent\" which can still be tempered by DPA guidance.\n\n4. **The CJEU ruling only requires that consent is not automatically gathered** - The CJEU is sensitive to the fact that the EDPB and local DPAs have primacy when it comes to interpertation and enforcement of data protection laws across the EU. As such, this ruling only makes a minor impact on the interpretation of EU cookie requirements. Rather than requiring \"unchecked checkboxes\", the ruling only requires that consent is not automatic. This is compatible with the AEPD advice as cookies are not automatically set when the cookie banner appears - cookies will only be set when a user clicks anywhere on the website other than the link which takes them to the cookie options page.\n\n\nThis is an area of mass confusion and interpretation, mainly because we have two pieces of EU privacy law which do not create a clear image of how we should act. The long awaited e-Privacy Regulation, which was supposed to be published alongside GDPR, is taking a long time to be implemented. When it is, it should harmonise this area of law and restore clarity.",

If you say that this cookie is not strictly necessary, it would seem that you cannot use Cloudflare's free plan.\n\nThe ePrivacy directive says that you need consent for any cookies that are not strictly necessary. The German legal situation is a bit murky, but the consent requirement has recently been clarified and re-emphasised in the ECJ's (EuGH) Planet49 case. Consent means opt-in, and must be freely given. You cannot use non-necessary cookies without consent, and you must also make it possible to decline or withdraw consent. Merely showing an “agree” button is not sufficient.\n\nWhereas Cloudflare can be your data processor, services like Giphy cannot (I presume). When sending user data to those third party services through embeds, you need an appropriate legal basis. At least in Germany, it has become somewhat customary to put embeds like videos or tweets behind a consent wall: instead of the embed, a message asking for consent is shown. When consent is given, the actual embed is loaded (and this preference is remembered in a cookie).\n\nThe necessary parts of a privacy policy are largely enumerated by GDPR Art 13 & 15. Note that you need to explain\n\n* what kinds of data processors you use (e.g. content delivery networks like Cloudflare),\n* what the purposes and legal bases of processing are (e.g. a legitimate interest to ensure the security of the site, and consent to load third party embeds),\n* whether/how data is transferred to non-EU countries (e.g. to the US due to using Cloudflare, under the basis of an adequacy decision because Cloudflare maintains a Privacy Shield certification).",

You should explain that you use cookies in your privacy policy, but you don't need a banner to announce this.\n   * For non-essential cookies, all the cookie banners that you see that do not give an actual *choice* are still operating under a pre-GDPR definition of “consent”, where continuing to use the site is implied consent. Although that is non-compliant, enforcement is not a priority.\n   * Your privacy policy does not have to discuss *why* a cookie is necessary. It is sufficient to explain in broad terms what processing you do (like using cookies) and what the purposes of processing are (like securing the site). Larger data controllers need to create an internal Records of Processing document that explicitly discusses which kind of processing activity is done for what purpose and under which legal basis.\n* The issue with embedded content is not primarily that the embed may set cookies, but that the embed provider can track users (or more generally: process personal data of your visitors). You need a legal basis for this *sharing* with third party providers.\n   * I don't remember the name right now, but there was a case that concluded that website operators are jointly responsible for Facebook's use of data when they embed a Facebook “like button”.\n   * Therefore, the standard solution is to only load embeds when explicitly requested by the user.\n* If Cloudflare is your data processor, Cloudflare's servers are effectively your servers. \n   * You do not need a legal basis for using Cloudflare.\n   * But you do need to explain why you are allowed to transfer data into the US.\n\nWhile striving for compliance is good, it's not necessary to go overboard. The data protection authorities seem largely interested in helping controllers become compliant, not so much in dishing out maximum fines. In Germany, the larger issue is the Abmahnindustrie, but those are not common in a GDPR context (primarily because only natural persons – not competitor businesses – have standing to sue for violations).",

Art 32 does mandate that certain kinds of measures are considered, e.g. pseudonymisation, encryption, backups, and security evaluations. These concepts are not specific to backend stuff, and could also apply to frontend. For example, encryption could involve usage of HTTPS, HSTS, and the Secure flag on cookies, or even E2E encryption.\n\nWhat is important is that the measures are *appropriate* (Art 32). What is appropriate depends on the state of the art, but also on the risks to data subjects. A CSP is definitely state of the art, but it would be fairly useless e.g. on a static site or on a site that otherwise prevents XSS. E.g. when loading scripts from third party domains, an alternative to CSP could be to use subresource integrity. It is the job of the controller and processor to figure out which measures are appropriate.\n\neIDAS only applies to very specific processing activities, namely identification schemes and trust services.
