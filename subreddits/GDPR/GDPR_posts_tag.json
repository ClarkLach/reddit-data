Google Tag Manager.\n\nThe cookie banner is a clear case, so let's skip to GTM. The court says that because GTM downloads a script 'gtm.js' and stores that on the client, that's against the ePrivacy directive. That's a very narrow interpretation and would basically mean that _any_ Javascript you load from any server would need consent, unless it is absolutely necessary to provide the site (which is almost never is in the case of scripts, as you can very well just provide a plain HTML site), as the browser will always 'download and store' the Javascript. I understand that the ePrivacy directive can be read this narrowly, but it creates a legal uncertainty where almost every website could be in breach of the ePrivacy directive.\n\nAnother reason they give is that Google is processing data (the IP address). That's true, but Google can just be a processor of the website provider. The transfer to the US is also allowed under the Data Privacy Framework. So the fact that it's Google is not relevant.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I would really like to see GTM-usage being banned. But I would really have preferred if that decision was either based on 1.) Transfer of data to the US (e.g., invalidating DPF and/or usage of SCCs) or 2.) The fact that Google does further processing of the data and does not act strictly as a processor (which is probably the case, but was not proven in this case, they merely state that Google's business model is to process a lot of personal data).",

                "body": "I share your slight feeling of unease. Most of this is ‚Äúduh‚Äù, and well-established by other court cases. The GTM stuff is more tricky. Ultimately, this judgment is not about GTM, but about consent.\n\nThe judgment is not quite making the argument that the *downloading* of the `gtm.js` script itself is storage of information, and thus subject to the ePrivacy rules. Instead, it says that this GTM script *performs* access/storage of information, which is then subject to ePrivacy, even when GTM hasn't loaded any 3rd party tags yet.\n\nBtw, the EDPB does promote a fairly narrow interpretation of access and storage of information in their [Guidelines 2/2023 on Technical Scope of Art. 5(3) of ePrivacy Directive](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-22023-technical-scope-art-53-eprivacy-directive_en). For example, they argue that even transient storage in RAM counts as storage for the purpose of this law. But the EDPB doesn't see the downloading as a script or HTML page as storage, unless that download acts as a tracking pixel.\n\nThe international data transfer aspect kind of gets lost between all the text. The key points are as follows, but they're analogous to the GDPR consent problem.\n\n* The case was filed in late 2022, before the DPF came into force.\n* The website connected to the US-based GTM servers upon page load.\n  * This is an international data transfer.\n  * This is also processing of personal data, requiring a legal basis.\n* The consent banner requested consent to international data transfers per Art. 49(1)(a). This was too late, as the transfer had already happened at that point. Any consent was also invalid, because this detail was hidden below the fold.\n* For the processing of personal data, none of Art 6(1)(a) \"consent\", Art 6(1)(c) \"legal obligation\", or Art 6(1)(f) \"legitimate interest\" apply.\n  * Legal obligations are completely off.\n  * Any consent would come too late.\n  * The three-step legitimate interest balancing test fails because using GTM is neither necessary (there are less invasive alternatives), nor does the legitimate interest outweigh the data subjects' rights and interests.\n\nAll of this, and especially the legitimate interest aspect, is reminiscent of the infamous ‚ÄúGoogle Fonts‚Äù case. But there's a key difference. I believe the Google Fonts thing would have to be decided differently if Google were  to act as a data processor. But for this GTM case, it doesn't matter that much how the script was *served* (beyond the Art 49 issues), and the focus is more on what this script *does*.\n\nI'm also not sure when, if ever, Google acts as a processor for GTM? There are [GTM terms of service](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7157428) which explain that Google may use some of the data, but also that GTM customers [may enter into a data processing agreement](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7207086), though [the agreement doesn't discuss GTM](https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/).",

I am finding out that this doesn't work well, because many conversions outside the UK and EU are not being counted in Google Ads.\n\nMy original plan was to only show the consent banner in the UK and EU (and/or other regions where it's mandatory).  But because some conversions outside the UK and EU are not being counted in Google Ads, the only way to address this situation is to show the Cookie Script consent banner to all my customers around the world, and the consent banner also probably needs to cover most of the landing page, to force an \"Accept\" all cookies or \"Reject\" from the customer (hopefully I can get most customers to \"Accept\" the cookies).\n\nNow my questions is, after you put up a consent banner that took up most of the landing page to force an \"Accept\" all cookies or \"Reject\" it from the customers, how was your bounce rate on your landing page? Did the bounce rate on your landing page increase significantly after you put up a consent banner ? Or did the bounce rate only increase slightly and the consent banner didn't stop many customers from browsing your website?",

Also the type of newsletter would be also important e.g. sending industry news would be more akin to a commercial endeavour vs. having friends sign up for a family newsletter.\n\nA bit more information would be needed to understand what you are trying to accomplish to determine if it falls into Article 18, and information about the plug-ins would be necessary to make a determination - but in general you cannot just rely on plug-ins for your compliance requirements without actually looking into the data that they collect, how they process it and if there are other activities that they do without your direct instruction.",

However, making a blog available to the general public is unlikely to be a purely personal activity, in particular when the comment section or the newsletter might involve processing of personal data of people with whom OP has no personal relationship.\n\nEven though not a perfect fit, the old Lindqvist case ([C-101/01](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-101/01)) seems relevant. In para 47:\n\n> That exception must therefore be interpreted as relating only to activities which are carried out in the course of private or family life of individuals, which is clearly not the case with the processing of personal data consisting in publication on the internet so that those data are made accessible to an indefinite number of people. \n\nThat case is about a blogger who publicly discussed the private life of her coworkers, so the question is really about whether the processing of coworker's personal data was covered by the exception, not directly whether a blog in general would be covered. The case is also from 2001, and was therefore based on the old Data Protection Directive that was later replaced by the GDPR. But the GDPR used the exception in the DPD verbatim, and the general discussion about this exception remains directly applicable. The ECJ found that this exception must be interpreted narrowly, and that access by an indefinite group of people weighs against this exception.\n\nSo I'd expect that no blog is covered by the household exception except maybe for access-protected pages or sites hosted on an intranet. In a German context, I'd also consider whether the TMG and the Impressumspflicht applies. This would have to be answered affirmatively if it would be possible to run the website in a business-like manner, which is typically going to be the case (even if it is currently un-monetized).",

                "body": "GDPR is not a box-ticking exercise, so just integrating a consent plugin is not sufficient.\n\nAchieving full compliance is difficult, the typical goal is more to reduce the risk of compliance problems. The basics like complete privacy notice, proper consent management, DPAs with service providers, email subscription management are easy but superficial. What is more difficult is figuring out who you're sharing data with after installing a few plugins, and how you can handle international transfers.\n\nSome more detailed notes on various aspects.\n\n* You must have a privacy notice that meets the requirements in Art 13 GDPR. It must list what data you collect from visitors for which purposes and under which legal basis (e.g. consent or legitimate interest).\n* For certain activities like accessing or storing information on the end user's device, EU laws says you can only use consent. Exception: if the access is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user. So storing analytics identifiers: consent. Storing dark/light theme preference: strictly necessary, no consent required. Storing consent status: strictly necessary, no consent required.\n* If you rely on consent, you must collect consent in a valid manner. Art 7 GDPR lists conditions for consent. Consent must be freely given, specific to a purpose, unambiguous, and informed. In my opinion, many cookie banners are not compliant because they don't offer a free choice (dark patterns steering the user away from declining consent). If you have multiple purposes, three top-level choices ‚Äúallow all‚Äù/‚Äúonly necessary‚Äù/‚Äúconfigure‚Äù seem sensible. The cookie banner should summarize what the users are consenting to, but more detailed information should be available as well (e.g. via a link to your full privacy notice).\n* The default is that no consent is given, so a workflow like ‚Äúif the user declines consent, deactivate Google Analytics‚Äù is probably too late. Instead, the things that require consent should either wait until they are notified of consent, or the consent management tool should only load them if consent was given. The various plugins you use might not do this correctly by default.\n* Yes, deferring analytics until consent was given will mess up your analytics data (e.g. bounce rate, uniques). There is an argument that analytics without consent can be OK e.g. if your country's laws have an explicit exception for that, or if it doesn't involve accessing any info on the end user's device. But in the past months, my opinion has shifted that this isn't realistic. National exceptions are probably in violation of EU law, and no common analytics solution can work without access to info in the user's browser. This isn't just about cookies.\n* You are responsible for everything that happens on your website. You can't integrate a plugin and argue that the plugin provider is responsible for GDPR. Don't use plugins where you can't control what's going on.\n* When other companies process personal data on your behalf, they are your ‚Äúdata processors‚Äù. You need a Data Processing Agreement contract with all of them (see Art 28 GDPR). Sometimes, the DPA is already part of the normal terms of service. Don't use providers where you don't get a DPA. Don't be confused by claims that a company is ‚ÄúGDPR-compliant‚Äù: whether *they* are compliant is often unrelated to the question whether *your use* of their services would be compliant as well.\n* If you are transferring personal data to controllers or processors outside of the EU/EEA/UK, you need additional safeguards for such international transfers per Chapter V GDPR. This is quite difficult in practice, considering that many services are US-based but the US do not have an adequate level of data protection (Privacy Shield is no longer valid). Most people just sign ‚Äústandard contractual clauses‚Äù (SCCs), but everyone knows that they're often invalid and just hope that the data protection agencies don't pay too much attention.\n* You're collecting email addresses for your newsletter. Your legal basis for this is likely to be consent. But consent means that you can only use the data for the specific purpose that consent was given for. For example, if you later start including ads in the newsletter, that might not be covered by the consent that the recipients previously gave. So (a) make sure that you're not unnecessarily restricting your future plans when asking for consent, and (b) make sure that you can tell which recipient consented to what exactly. Regarding future plans, consider whether you might eventually want to incorporate a business or transfer the site to someone else. This would require transferring your subscriber list, but the readers didn't consent to that. Better cover all your bases in your privacy notice before you get your first subscriber.\n* Your email list should be handled in a manner that makes it possible for you to comply with data subject requests, including Access (‚Äútell me everything you've stored about me‚Äù) and Erasure (‚Äúdelete everything about me that you're not legally required to keep‚Äù). In practice this should be easy, it's just that you should be able to unsubscribe people manually without telling them to click the ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù link.",

I'd be grateful for a sanity check on my proposed data collection architecture.\n\nThe system is designed to operate in two distinct modes based on user consent managed by a TCF v2.2 CMP.\n\n# Mode 1: Consentless (Default Operation)\n\nThis mode runs for all users by default, without requiring consent.\n\n* Technology: No cookies, localStorage, or device fingerprinting techniques are used.\n* Data Collected & Processed: This mode involves two distinct processing activities:\n   1. For Analytics: The data stored is purely aggregated and anonymous (e.g., {page: \"/about\", referrer: \"google.com\"}).\n   2. For Security: To ensure data integrity and prevent bot traffic, we briefly process the visitor's IP address. This is done by creating a salted hash of the IP, which is held for a short period (e.g., 24 hours) for security analysis before being deleted. The full, raw IP is never stored.\n* Legal Basis: We use two separate legal bases for this mode:\n   1. For Analytics: The resulting data is truly anonymous, so the GDPR would not apply.\n   2. For Security: We process the IP address under our Legitimate Interest (Article6(1)(f)) to protect our service and ensure network security, backed by a Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA).\n\n# Mode 2: Consent (Post Opt-in)\n\nThis mode is only activated after a user gives explicit consent through the CMP for relevant purposes.\n\n* Technology: A first-party cookie is set with a unique user ID.\n* Data Collected: Detailed event streams, session data, and other personal data are collected to build behavioral profiles.\n* Legal Basis: Explicit Consent under GDPR Article6(1)(a).\n\n# My Core Compliance Questions:\n\n1. The Hybrid Model: Does this approach of running a stripped-down, consent-free analytics engine by default (with a separate, legitimate-interest-based security check) seem compliant, with personal data profiling layered on top only after acquiring consent?\n2. Data Linking Risk: My biggest question is about data history. Is it in any way compliant to associate the aggregated data collected in \"Consentless Mode\" with a user's profile once they enter \"Consent Mode\"? I believe this is a red line because it would retroactively make the 'anonymous' data identifiable, meaning it was personal data processed without a valid legal basis from the start. Am I thinking about this correctly?\n3. Unknown Unknowns: Besides the data-linking issue, what other significant compliance pitfalls should I be looking out for with this architecture?\n\nI appreciate any feedback or pointers to relevant guidance from the community. Thank you!",

The specifics you have laid out raise a number of concerns. \n\nRegarding 2. Data Linking Risk: If the data is even in-theory linkable, that indicates that it wasn't anonymous to begin with. Even if you *don't actually link it*. The fact that you *could* means it's personal data. It should not be physically possible to identify an individual in aggregated data so the fact that you're even thinking about this makes me concerned that you're not using the term \"aggregated\" correctly. If you are story non-aggregated data but only asking about aggregated data, you will get tremendously, greviously wrong advice.\n\nGenerally the main issue is that the anonymization process is still data processing. You are collecting and processing personal data, however briefly, in order to derive the aggregated and anonymous data. GDPR still applies to all of that, including e.g. the IP address and referrer and whatnot. You'll need a legal basis and suchlike.\n\nA strict reading of the ePrivacy Directive would say that it applies not just to writing data to the user's device, but also reading data that was already present. That would include the page referrer, although not the IP address. Tread lightly.\n\nIs this for your own website or is this to re-sell as a service? If you're trying to build a SaaS, then there's an entire bucket of worms around being the Processor rather than the Controller. That would include, for example, *not* deciding the Legal Basis. Big no-no. Don't do that. Thinking about the Legal Basis is for Controllers, and you don't want to be a Controller.",

The support from AdOpt argues that it's not my responsibility if a user blocks the CMP, but I find that risky.

This includes HMRC starter forms.\n- On one occasion an employee sick note - it‚Äôs in a folder called CONFIDENTIAL but as there‚Äôs no actual restriction to access this basically means nothing \n- Numerous images of passports for old staff dating back to 2018  \n- A document with a list of all people partaking in our customers with memberships, that has links to photos of their proof of address and/or ID‚Äôs. These photos are only accessible when logged in to an account. \n\nI am able to access all of the above by opening the link in an incognito tab,  it‚Äôs just the photos of ID etc that seem to be absolutely locked in our drive.

That said, we‚Äôve encountered a similar situation and advised our client either to deny access to the Drive altogether or to enforce very strict usage guidelines, because there are myriad scenarios that could go wrong.\n\nMany of the companies we know rely on Google Drive, yet often fail to implement proper access controls, both internally and externally. Navigating this can be challenging, especially when there is resistance to changing existing practices. Unfortunately, that resistance does not eliminate the risks tied to such an approach, despite many of which could be mitigated with simple precautions.\n\nFor instance, even without granting external access, oversharing remains a recurring internal issue in organizations. While the principle of least privilege is widely recommended, applying it in practice becomes difficult when dealing with a cluttered folder structure.\n\nIn such a case where cluttered folders are present, if access is granted without clear limitations, there is a real risk that an external party may end up viewing confidential or sensitive information stored within the Drive, significantly increasing the likelihood of a breach. This external party does not necessarily have to be the service provider; it could just as easily be a third party who gained access to their systems, or someone who has gone \"rogue\".\n\nAs a general mindset, I personally lean toward a skeptical approach: trust nothing by default and always prepare for the worst. We have to keep business going but, accidents do happen.",

        "author": "latkde",
        "id": "sg8sll",
        "selftext": "In a [judgement from 2022-01-20 in case 3 O 17493/20](https://rewis.io/urteile/urteil/lhm-20-01-2022-3-o-1749320/), the *Landgericht M√ºnchen* in Germany found that there is no legitimate interest for using Google Fonts. By extensions, this means any use of CDNs is improper.\n\nCore points from the judgement, translated from German:\n\n* The website was ordered to pay a small compensation of EUR 100 to the data subject and to fulfill an Art 15 data subject access request.\n* Embedding fonts from Google Fonts means transmitting the dynamic IP address of the visitor to Google.\n* The dynamic IP address is personal data. The court summarizes the argument from the *Breyer* judgement, that there are reasonable means to identify the data subject with the help of third parties, namely the competent authority and the ISP. ‚ÄúFor this it is sufficient that the defendant has the abstract means for identification of the person behind the IP address. Whether the defendant or Google have the concrete means for linking the IP address with the plaintiff is irrelevant.‚Äù\n* There was no legal basis for this disclosure. Clearly, there was no consent. There also was no legitimate interest because ‚ÄúGoogle Fonts can also be used by the defendant without establishing a connection to Google servers when the page loads‚Äù. Presumably, the court suggests that the assets can be self-hosted instead.\n* There is a confusing paragraph about ‚Äúencrypting‚Äù the IP address. Presumably, this means that the data subject does not have an obligation to use VPNs. The argument is that compliance obligations cannot be reversed so that the data subject ‚Äì who should *benefit* from data protection rights ‚Äì would be responsible for maintaining their privacy.\n* Transmitting this personal data without legal basis violates the affected person's personality rights. This gives rise to a right of compensation per Art 82 GDPR. In calculating the damages, the court took into account that this was regular and not a one-off disclosure, that Google is known for tracking, that transfers to Google's servers in the US do not have an adequate level of data protection, and that the purposes of these damages is also to deter future infringements. In case of repeat infringement, the website was threatened with a fine of ‚Äúup to‚Äù EUR 250000.\n\nDiscussion of consequences and the wider context:\n\n* Schrems II enforcement has arrived in the mainstream. Unnecessary transfers into the US and to US-based companies are now routinely seen as an aggravating factor.\n* This judgement can be seen in a context of closer scrutiny of web privacy / Schrems II issues by courts and supervisory authorities, such as the Austrian DPA's decision that Google Analytics are not OK ([read article by NOYB](https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-dsb-eu-us-data-transfers-google-analytics-illegal)), or another German court's decision about the use of Akamai by Cookiebot ([read article from IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/new-eu-data-blockage-as-german-court-would-ban-many-cookie-management-providers/)).\n* There is no legitimate interest for using CDNs when the assets could be self-hosted instead. Loading content from third parties should generally be made conditional on valid consent. However, this court's argument does not seem applicable when the CDN acts as a data processor. So this clearly affects public/free CDNs for open-source assets like cdnjs, jsdelivr, Google Fonts, BootstrapCDN and the like, but not necessarily commercial/private offerings like Akamai, Cloudfront, Cloudflare, or Fastly. On the other hand, the Cookiebot case mentioned above does single out transfers to Akamai as illegal, though I'm far less convinced that the argument in the Cookiebot case would withstand an appeal.\n* So far, the damages are largely symbolic. The EUR 100 compensation is small compared to the legal costs both parties will have incurred. But this was a single individual, not a group, and compensation for damages suffered, not an administrative fine. The important aspect is not the amount of the fine, but that non-zero damages were assumed for the mere disclosure of an IP address to Google.",

Previous decisions effectively become a kind of law.\n\nIn a civil law system, laws are given by the legislator. Courts interpret and apply the law and in doing so can disagree with previous rulings in similar matters. In Germany, courts do cite other decisions, but on roughly equal footing with legal literature like commentaries (or EDPB guidelines!). In practice, courts do align with the interpretation suggested by superior courts. In particular, decisions by the European Court of Justice are so important because they make decisions about the correct interpretation of EU law ‚Äì the ECJ doesn't concern itself too much with the concrete case at hand. Only constitutional courts participate in the development of law, such as by rejecting a law as unconstitutional.\n\nSo the decision in this case does not bind other courts to decide similarly. But the decision has become part of jurisprudence and might be cited in future decisions by other courts. I think it is a very straightforward case that was resolved in a straightforward manner and will be easy to cite by others. It is difficult to disagree with the decision, and the judgment itself calls this a slam-dunk case (though in polite legalese: the lawsuit is ‚Äúoverwhelmingly justified‚Äù). On the other hand it does not decide a particularly novel matter so it isn't very relevant ‚Äì the case received attention primarily because everyone uses Google Fonts, so there is a large *practical* impact. The same decision could have been made back in 2018, based solely on the *Breyer* case where the ECJ decided that dynamic IP addresses are personal data.\n\nThe only potentially interesting aspect of this judgement is the concrete statement about the lack of a legitimate interest. On the other hand, that is a clear consequence of the *necessity test* required for a legitimate interest.\n\nWhen gusmaru asks if this means ‚Äúthat EU Website Operators are unable to reference or link to anything residing in the US‚Äù, the technically correct answer is no ‚Äì the judgement itself has no *legal* effect on courts or data controllers. But the decision reflects an interpretation of the law that seems reasonable. If someone argues a different interpretation, they should use this judgement to update their interpretation even though it is technically still possible to disagree. So this has the *practical* effect of notifying the web developer community that previous assumptions about CDNs do not hold (and weren't correct in Europe since 2018, if not 1995).",

In fact, the LG M√ºnchen cited another judgement from the *Breyer* saga.\n\nBut neither the GDPR nor this judgement forbid processing personal data or IP addresses. Here, the court only ruled against sharing personal data to third parties without a good reason. ‚ÄúBut it's a CDN‚Äù or ‚Äúpretty fonts‚Äù was not considered to be a good reason by the court, as the fonts could have been self-hosted instead.

There are three possible approaches to resolve this:\n\n* *stop* loading stuff from third parties\n* stop loading stuff from *random third parties* ‚Äì sign a Data Processing Agreement with them instead so that they are contractually bound to only use the data as instructed by you, but not for their own purposes.\n* have a good reason\n\nWhich of these three approaches is appropriate depends entirely on context.\n\nAs an example, let's consider embedding a YouTube video. You really want to show that video (solution #1 won't work) and YouTube won't sign a DPA for you (solution #2 won't work). This leaves the third approach: have a very good reason.\n\nIn some cases there might be a contractual necessity for sharing data with a third party (for example, connecting with an OAuth server is strictly necessary when the user selected this authentication option). Sometimes there might be a legitimate interest. But consent always works.\n\nThe common solution ‚Äì widely used here in Germany since about a decade ‚Äì is to replace the embedded content with a placeholder. The placeholder briefly explains the risks of loading third party content (data like IP addresses is shared with the third party, and what happens with the data is outside your control). The placeholder asks for consent. Clicking on the placeholder loads the actual content. This way, no communication with the third party occurs until the user gives consent. Of course, the consent status can be remembered in a cookie so that the user only has to be asked the first time. The other content in the site remains accessible without consent.\n\n> GDPR also prohibits not displaying or allowing access to people who don't want to share that information\n\nArt 7(4) says that consent will typically not be freely given if performance of a service is made conditional on unrelated consent. Only loading a video when the user consents to personalized ads ‚Üí unrelated consent and illegal. Only loading a YouTube video when the user consents to loading content from YouTube ‚Üí that consent is necessary to perform the service and therefore legal.",

A company had inserted Facebook Like buttons on the web page, and argued that it was not responsible for the ensuing disclosure of personal data (such as IP addresses or possible tracking cookies) to Facebook. See, it was the browser and not the website operator that disclosed the data, and the website operator never had access to the data in the browser in the first place!\n\nThe European Court of Justice did not buy this argument. By coding the website in a particular way, the website operator was responsible for causing the user's browser to act in a particular way, so it was the ‚Äúdata controller‚Äù for the collection an transmission of personal data by the Facebook Like button, though Facebook is of course jointly responsible for what their code does.\n\nThe underlying argument is that someone is a data controller and thus responsible for GDPR compliance when they determine the ‚Äúpurposes and means‚Äù of processing, alone or jointly with others. Embedding the code for the button was an exercise of this power to determine purposes and means. In contrast, the website operator is not a data controller for whatever Facebook does with the collected data on its servers, because it cannot control what FB does.\n\nHaving access to the data is not always necessary in order to be the data controller responsible for the processing. This was decided even earlier in the *Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein* case where the creator of a Facebook page was found to be jointly responsible with Facebook for cookie compliance issues. I think that case was also cited in the *Fashion ID* judgement.\n\nThe given case from Munich is a very straightforward extension from the Fashion ID judgement, though the website operator didn't even claim that they weren't responsible.",

The website owner would already have a valid legitimate interest to process IP addresses to deliver the website itself, I guess.\n\nYes. The problem isn't that IP addresses are a thing. That problem is needlessly sharing personal data with a third party which could then use this data for whatever purposes.\n\n> Is there no requirement to demonstrate the *necessity* to engage a data processor to perform a function in the first place?\n\nThe GDPR does not restrict what activities may be outsourced to processors. Anything is fair game. You don't need a legal basis for using a processor ‚Äì the processor merely acts on behalf of the data controller, and is contractually bound to only use the data as instructed by the controller. So the processor acts as an extension of the controller, not as an independent controller.\n\nThe limitations to this ability to outsource processing activities are (a) that there must be an enforceable contract that binds the processor per Art 28 GDPR, and (b) that the rules on international transfers must of course be followed, if applicable. This latter constraint makes the use of e.g. US or Australian processors quite questionable.\n\n> Would adding [a CDN acting as data processor] to an existing website not be a violation of the \"necessity\" requirement of art(5)(1)(c) -- given that the existing website must have the capability to serve static files, without involving a third party DPA's servers?\n\nI don't think arguing from the Art 5(1)(c) data minimization principle is a good fit here. It says: given an otherwise legal purpose, you can't process more data than necessary for that purpose. But here, we're processing the same amount of data (the IP address + other traffic data), regardless of how we conduct the processing (self-hosted or third party server).\n\nThe ‚Äúnecessity‚Äù can be introduced more clearly through Art 6(1). *All* legal bases other than consent require that the processing is necessary. If I were to pick an Art 5 principle to found this on, I'd pick the Art 5(1)(a) lawfulness principle: personal data shall be ‚Äúprocessed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject‚Äù. The data cannot be used for other purposes per the Art 5(1)(b) purpose limitation principle, unless the new purposes are compatible.\n\nOnce a processing activity is legal, the controller can decide freely how to carry out this processing, taking into account the GDPR's principles and conditions. I don't see any terms that would require or prohibit engaging a CDN as a data processor. In practice, this is often just the choice between two data processors anyway: am I engaging a processor to serve assets from a CDN on my behalf, or am I engaging a processor to provide hosting space or a server on my behalf? The GDPR does not require anyone to maintain their own hardware. At most, there might be interesting interactions via Art 32 GDPR (security of processing), which also involves aspects like availability and resilience of the processing systems. I think it is usually easier to argue that a specialized data processor (such as a cloud provider) is better equipped to help me fulfill such security goals than I am on my own.",

GDPR must allow for the outcome of that evaluation to be negative. This makes the case that an IP-address cannot by default be personal data.\n\nI agree that Recital 26 offers the possibility of reaching a conclusion that a given information is not personal data. But it doesn't follow that we should treat IP addresses as anonymous information by default.\n\nLiability argument:\nAn IP address is either anonymous or personal data. There are no further GDPR restrictions on using anonymous data, but there are regulations about using personal data. Thus, the only compliant approach ‚Äì if we do not specifically know that the IP addresses are anonymous in this context ‚Äì is to treat them as personal data by default. But sure, this can be disproven.\n\nLikelihood argument:\nThe ECJ gave us the analysis in the *Breyer* case that\n\n> a dynamic IP address registered by an online media services provider when a person accesses a website that the provider makes accessible to the public constitutes personal data within the meaning of that provision, in relation to that provider, where the latter has the legal means which enable it to identify the data subject with additional data which the internet service provider has about that person.\n\nThis is a conditional statement. But then this decision was given back to the lower court, which in this case was the German BGH. The LG M√ºnchen decision about Google Fonts cites this exact BGH decision. The BGH found that German law does afford such legal means which enable the controller to identify the data subject. So at least in the German context in which the LG M√ºnchen works, the ECJ's finding is effectively unconditional. I would expect the same in all other rule-of-law countries as well.\n\nSo, based on the observation that courts have ruled that the controller will typically have the means of identifying the data subject, it is more likely that a user's IP address will be personal data than that it is truly anonymous.\n\nI'm not saying ‚Äì and hopefully never have said ‚Äì that all IP addresses are always personal data. It is straightforward to poke holes into the ECJ/BGH decisions for specific scenarios, for example if the user's ISP is not subject to the controller's jurisdiction and out of reach of mutual assistance treaties, or if the ISP (or VPN provider) doesn't keep relevant logs.

What I think (and no, I don't have any research available right now, but I'm speaking from experience -- do with it what you want) is that you should avoid loading 3rd party services (like Google Fonts, Analytics, advertisements, Font Awesome, jQuery, etc.) from the CDNs these services usually suggest to spare yourself the DNS lookups. \n\nThey offer their files through CDNs for easy implementation, so it's understandable, but it's not for nothing that services like Pingdom and PageSpeed Insights always advise you to reduce/minimize DNS lookups. \n\nThis doesn't mean that CDNs in general are just a hype. No, using a CDN for your own website (meaning all content, instead of just a few JS/CSS files, is served from that CDN) can definitely be beneficial for performance if you want to have international reach. For local businesses I wouldn't suggest using a CDN, though. :-)\n\nI hope that clarifies things!",

Seems like the first definitive answer I‚Äôve received!! \n\n> Transparency and the Right to be Informed\n\n>Employers implementing in-vehicle tracking must also comply with their transparency obligations under the GDPR, and ensure they meet the employee‚Äôs right to be informed.5\nAn employee must be informed of the existence of tracking and how it operates as well as being clearly informed of all the purposes for which their personal data is to be used, in advance of any such tracking being implemented. This means that the employer must clearly explain to the employee who is using the vehicle concerned what records are being created, why those records are necessary, what they will be used for, how long they will be kept for, who will have access to them and for what reason.\nIt is critical that employees are made fully aware of the extent of the use of the personal data collected through vehicle tracking. Under no circumstances should an employee be left in a situation in which they are unclear on what information is being collected or the purposes of that tracking. The data collected may not be used for any other purpose, unless that processing is compatible with the original purpose of collection.\nAn employee should receive prior notice and clear and comprehensive information about the type and purpose of the tracking. The Article 29 Working Party (WP29)6 recommended that such information should be displayed prominently in every car, within eyesight of the driver.7 While not compulsory, this may be considered good practice for compliance with transparency requirements.\nEmployers should devise and make available to drivers a policy on the use of vehicle tracking. In the context of the use of vehicle tracking devices, this document should also set out the employer's policy on the use of company vehicles for private use, if private use is permissible.\n\nDefinitely seems like they have breached GDPR here, but what are the potential ramifications or consequences of this?\n\nThey have provided me with this information now, but only after 3 weeks of tracking",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been working for an EU-based digital startup for about a year. We‚Äôve built a global data architecture as we plan to launch our app in the US market as well as in the EEA (EU). Our goal is to gain deep insights into in-app user behavior to create segments of successful and unsuccessful users. Along the way, we collect a substantial amount of sensitive data (medical insights, emails, names, etc.). \n\nTo comply with GDPR, we funnel our user input into two separate operational databases located in the US and EU to meet data residency requirements. However, we recently realized that the event data we collect via our Firebase SDK integration with Google Analytics 4 also contains a lot of sensitive information. To obtain granular data without relying on the GA4 interface, we used the BigQuery link to export all of our custom events and attributes to Google BigQuery. From there, we use Fivetran to transfer the data into our EU-hosted Snowflake data warehouse to combine it with our operational databases.\n\nWe‚Äôve been consulting with our designated DPO, but no one seems to have a fitting answer to the question: ‚ÄúWhat are the alternatives to our GA4 setup that allow us to record sensitive event data to monitor our developments?‚Äù\n\nAccording to our research, GA4 temporarily stores user data collected in the EU but then sends it to the US for processing. This would violate GDPR if we track medical records (weight, BMI, emails) via GA4.\n\nWe are aware that we could implement SCCs, Impact Assessments, TIAs, etc., to make these data transfers valid. However, our management would prefer a solution that allows us to store and process all data in the EU to minimize risks.\n\nWe have identified two alternative solutions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Replace GA4 with Firebase SDK + Firebase DB to store our event data. Then export the data from Firebase BigQuery into BigQuery and from there into Snowflake. Additionally, we are considering using UXCam to track user journeys throughout the app.\n\n2. Replace our GA4 setup and connect our SDK to Amplitude. Export our event data from Amplitude to Snowflake via Fivetran.\n\nThe questions I have are:\n\na) If we go the Firebase route, does Google still process our data in the US? The Firebase interface offers dashboards, which I assume are powered by our event data. Does the processing happen in the EU or the US?\n\nb) Has anyone used UXCam and can provide insights on its performance and areas where it does (or doesn‚Äôt) perform well?\n\nc) Is Amplitude a decent replacement for our setup? I am still looking for strong arguments to pitch to our product manager on why we should use tools like Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Heap instead of web-based analytics such as GA4/Firebase in combination with UXCam.\n\nAs you can tell, GDPR has been a significant challenge for our analytics as a startup with global aspirations. We collect and store a lot of sensitive data and, therefore, have to be very careful with our setup and how we transfer and analyze data across borders (or not).\n\nLastly, a slightly off-topic question: If we have an employee in the US logging into our Snowflake Data platform hosted in the EU to run queries and perform basic analytics, would this be considered a data transfer since the query results are a processing activity? Would GDPR flag this as a violation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know these are a lot of questions, but data privacy is highly complex and there isn‚Äôt much information about past use cases that fit our current operations. I've been specializing on Data Analytics and Science but app development has been a steep learning curve for me.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this. I look forward to a constructive discussion and hopefully some insights that will help us move in the right direction.\n\nCheers!\n\n&#x200B;",

                "body": ">  two separate operational databases located in the US and EU to meet data residency requirements\n\nThe EU/UK GDPR does not impose data residency requirements in the traditional sense. International transfers need safeguards, e.g. SCCs or an adequacy decision. US companies can self-certify under the *Data Privacy Framework* adequacy decision. Before that EU‚ÄìUS data transfers were quite shaky in the wake of the Schrems II decision, but for now there is a clear path for data transfers.\n\n> Along the way, we collect a substantial amount of sensitive data (medical insights, emails, names, etc.). \n\nA couple of pointers:\n\n* The EU GDPR declares \"special categories of data\" such as health information, processing of which is only legal under certain circumstances, such as *explicit consent*. This will also affect your risk assessments. But if processing this data is lawful, then data transfers can be OK as well.\n\n* Some services (such as Google Analytics) have a definition of PII/personal data that is different from the GDPR definition. However, GA forbids you from uploading data that they consider personal.\n\n* Depending on whether you create per-user profiles (even if pseudonymous) and what you do with that info, you may run into issues around the GDPR's limitations on profiling. This becomes especially problematic when you offer personalized offers or discounts. Some of that can be legal, but it gets increasingly complicated.\n\n> GDPR has been a significant challenge for our analytics as a startup with global aspirations.\n\nGDPR compliance in an international company can be really complicated. But here the main issue doesn't seem to be data transfer issues, but a culture that is not grounded in the GDPR's data minimization principle (Art 5(1)(c) / Art 25).\n\n> If we have an employee in the US logging into our Snowflake Data platform hosted in the EU to run queries and perform basic analytics, would this be considered a data transfer\n\nFor GDPR purposes, it doesn't matter where data is stored. It matters more where data is processed, in particular from where that processing is controlled. That can also happen via remote access.\n\nBut due to a technicality, it could be that no data transfer has taken place in that example: as commonly understood, a data transfer needs an *exporter* who is already subject to the GDPR, and a non-EU-based *importer* (e.g. compare EDPB guidelines 05/2021). If these are the same entity, no transfer would have taken place. The individual employee is not an importer because they just act on behalf of their company. However, a data transfer may have taken place if data is shared across different companies (possibly as part of the same undertaking).\n\nIn contrast, use of a cloud service such as GA or Firebase would very likely involve a data transfer. If your contract is with one of the US-based Google entities, then we have an exporter (your startup, regardless where it's based) and importer (Google, even when acting as a data processor on your behalf). If your contract is with the EU-based Google Ireland, you might not be the exporter yourself (that would happen between different Google companies), but there would still be an international data transfer under your responsibility.",

While your data resides in the chosen region, metadata or control data may be managed outside it.\n\n>**Support and Maintenance**: For operational purposes such as troubleshooting, support, and maintenance, some data might be accessed by personnel in different regions, potentially including the US.\n\n>**Inter-Region Replication**: For redundancy and disaster recovery, GCP might replicate data across regions, which could include regions in the US, depending on your configurations and services used.\n\n>**Global Services**: Some GCP services are global by nature (e.g., IAM, Cloud Storage with multi-region   \nbuckets), meaning data might be distributed or accessed across multiple regions, including the US.\n\nAs Google is part of the EU-US Data Protection Framework (DPF), these transfers would legally be considered flowing to an \"Adequate\" country while the DPF is considered valid.\n\nAs for the employee who is viewing the data from the US, this would be considered a data transfer under the GDPR as it considers viewing the information from a 3rd country a transfer.  You would need to document your technical controls over the individual, equipment and services - it's not totally prohibited, but you need to ensure that the data is protected from inappropriate access and use.",

DoubleClick for Publishers?). These are different products. While they are related (though less-related than you might expect), they have separate contracts and terms of service, and completely divergent privacy policies.\n\nFor Google Ads, Google acts as a Controller for some product features and a Processor for others. Whether it's a Controller or Processor for a particular processing operation sometimes depends on certain features that have been enabled in the account (meaning it can't be determined precisely by looking at network traffic), and also bleeds through into integrated products like Google Analytics.\n\nFor operations where Google is strictly a Processor, then the site owner takes the main brunt of not collecting consent. Although a claim *could* be made against Google for their lack of transparency about their processing operations. \n\nFor the purposes of remarketing (\"ads personalization\"), I *think* that Google's contracts make the site owner and Google Joint Controllers. Someone with more expertise on that aspect of GDPR will have to weigh in, but my understanding is that Google still has responsibility for showing its data was collected with proper consent.\n\nIf you're actually talking about Google Ad Manager, then I have no idea. It's not an aspect of the situation that I've studied.",

To be honest, if you are now focused on these types of issues and you are unable to progress further internally, it‚Äôs probably time to engage a lawyer or dp contractor to assist.\n\nI think the first thing you need to do is determine the data you are a controller for and the data you are a processor for.  For the controller data you will retain it in accordance with your retention policies for as long as necessary for whatever purposes you collected it.  For the processor data you delete or return it to your client at the end of the relationship (subject to any legal retention requirements to which you are subject)\n\nGenerally in my experience there will be a bunch of systems and processes that contain only controller data, a bunch that contain only processor data, and some that are mixed.  Eg, your crm system probably only contains controller data, so it won‚Äôt need to be automatically deleted on termination of services.  On the other hand, you may have an aws instance that contains only client data that you use as a processor, which would be subject to deletion/return on termination of the services.  Both of those systems are relatively easy to deal with.  The challenge is systems that contain both controller and processor data, and that‚Äôs where I‚Äôd probably start",

My issue seems a little nuanced so a second opinion would be great - though it might require some familiarity with  web dev. soooo....\n\nI am building a web-app. Users keep their anonymity - though are assigned an ID on registration (simply a 'BEGIN' button). They are asked a series of questions as they progress through the app, similar to a survey, with feedback given after each set of questions. \n\nThe questions relate to user experiences, though no combination of data points can be used to re-identify them. Answers are stored and attributed to a user ID. This allows us to recall answers later and give feedback. It will also allow us to give the user a password so they can recall their session at a later date. \n\nWe maintain that this data does not pertain to a users actual identity and we *only retain data that is necessary for our app to work*. Some of the collected answers are used for research, which is stated clearly in our Privacy Notice. The 'research' part is simply some automated graphs etc showing aggregate trends across answers. \n\nReferencing cookie law, our cookie banner offers users a choice to \n\n\t*i) Persist their login details locally so they can quickly resume there session easily on this device*\n\n\t*ii) opt in to Google Analytics*\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. The data we need for the app to work (arguably 'strictly necessary') is also used for internal research/reporting - two purposes, though we are fully transparent with our intentions. We highlight this both on the registration page and in our Privacy Notice. Both purposes are essential for the app to run, and \"opt-out\" is not really possible in this case. Does GDPR prevent us from generating reports from the data we collect? What is the correct way for us to ask them to agree to this on registration?\n2. By default no data is stored on the users computer, though a user ID is generated on registration and subsequent answers are sent to our server. I would like to persist the ID in localstorage so that the users session can be recalled when they return. Do I need the user to opt in to do this (i.e an option to consent within our cookie banner - above)? Can an \"accept all\" option be used? it is unlikely they will opt in at all if they have to configure each cookie individually with our cookie manager. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.

You only see what's needed when needed and hopefully there is a clear record on it. E.g. you do not \\`SELECT \\*\\`  on customer data, but rather \\`SELECT somefields WHERE customer\\_id=123\\` and ideally not via a direct DB access, but some more restricted UI.\n2. If you need to see the whole DB (e.g. when doing big restructuring), it is probably still okay if you only do it when really needed (e.g. admin grants you access for 1 day only)\n3. Certainly you'll follow all other normal security practices that GDPR would insist on even within EU (e.g. using VPN for encrypting traffic)\n4. The most tricky part about the local laws: Organisations are responsible for assessing and analysing whether the laws and practices of the third countries concerned are effective enough to meet the appropriate safeguards set by the GDPR.\n   1. If I am reading guidelines about it correctly, they don't forbid you from sharing data anywhere, but they make you (or your company to be precise) responsible for checking whether laws **and practices** of that remote country are effective enough to keep GDPR requirements\n   2. For example, if some Asian country is considered by EU as known to monitor all traffic of all people, it may be not okay to look at database containing EU phone numbers from it\n   3. For example, if some American country is known by EU in that their Intelligence Agency has right to forbid you to tell about even the fact of their visit, it may be not okay to work with the database of EU competitors to large American businesses in that country\n   4. At the same moment in both of these countries it could be okay to work with data containing contact addresses of clients of your own small company as both countries are very unlikely to be interested in going far for monitoring them (assuming your encryption etc practices are in order, so they can't do it in 5 seconds without you even knowing it)\n   5. **Note that I am not a lawyer at all**, just sharing my understanding and looking for more clarification myself - as, well, also thinking of remote work from remote countries sometimes. The biggest point of my understanding for this country limits is that it is not binary: **you have to think not of just \"That country laws allow for examining my traffic\", but also on whether \"The practices of that country mean we are likely to have them examining our traffic\"**\n\nP.S.\n\nAnd there are several countries about which EU explicitly concluded that their laws are adequate enough for GDPR level of protection (and thus you should be fine working from them following same practices as in the EU country) - [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions\\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) Just a dozen of countries there though and popular beach destinations aren't included :)",

In the course of your audit, you have flagged this as a potential risk. You have decided that this risk should be mitigated by having the test environment use synthetic data or de-identified data.\n\nIt seems that you do not yet understand who manages this test environment. You've jumped to the conclusion that the database administrators would be doing this, but that's usually not the case. It is likely that the software developers know more about what's going on. If your organization has a separate QA team that uses this test environment, they might be able to help as well. But there's no telling who imported the data there. Could be the database administrators, could be devs, could be a business analyst.\n\nDepending on how this test system is used, there might not be actual risks that have to be mitigated. It might be desirable (and ultimately good for security/privacy) to have a \"beta version\" of the IT system where a couple of end users can use an upcoming version of the system with real data.\n\nOn the other hand, you might find that test systems that are used further left in the development pipeline could work just as well with synthetic data, and that using real data here has unacceptable risks. It would then be necessary to discuss with Devs + QA + other relevant teams what a more compliant test environment would need, and how the necessary work can be prioritized.\n\nIn my personal experience as a software developer, I value testing with (small amounts of) real-world data because it avoids problems where the synthetic test data is accidentally different in some way. Synthetic data can also be more difficult to interpret than a real example. But I take great care to ensure that my tests won't interfere with production systems. If a lot of tests are performed with a database that was created with a snapshot of real data, that suggests that the test strategy for this IT system is insufficiently automated, that it's too much effort to set up a throwaway environment with synthetic data for each test run. It's not enough here to point to your compliance checklist, because changing a testing strategy can take a huge amount of effort.",

In practice, it may not be sufficient to point to a compliance checklist and expect things to change overnight. Instead, you'll have to figure out what the value of the status quo is, how that value can be achieved in a more compliant manner, and how to move your organization towards that future.

That makes issues like the one you have raised a lot easier to address, as the responsibility of what to do with the notes is with your customer as the controller rather than you.

                "body": "The cited WP 29 guidelines are from 2007. Since then, a lot has happened. Especially the research on identifiability has made some important advances around that time. The old Data Protection Directive on which these guidelines are based are even older, and predate important scientific results.\n\nSo while those WP 29 guidelines are important and well-reasoned, they are not particularly authoritative regarding GDPR.\n\nWhile the DPD and GDPR share a lot of text, there are also some important differences. E.g. the GDPR mentions ‚Äúsingling out‚Äù as an example of identifying someone. The GDPR added ‚Äúonline identifier‚Äù as an example of an identifier.\n\nI interpret this as meaning that if you can single out an individual, that data subject is identifiable. A random identifier in a cookie clearly makes it possible to single out an individual. If two HTTP requests have the same cookie value, that implies they are from the same browser session, thus most likely from the same person. Similarly, IP addresses allow singling out in most cases (except in case of massive NAT deployments, e.g. IP addresses that connect a large intranet). These IP addresses or cookie identifiers are at the very least *pseudonyms* of the data subjects ‚Äì but still personal.\n\nI note that my interpretation is in some contraction with the WP136 document, especially example 13. But that example has many additional aspects that ensure a level of anonymity. I don't think any DPAs or courts still doubt that cookie identifiers or IP addresses can constitute personal data.\n\nThe reference to ‚Äúanother person‚Äù is important in case the data is shared with others, or even published. If that data is anonymous, then *no one* who gets the data will be able to identify data subjects. If someone else can combine the data with additional data that allows re-identification, the data is not anonymous. So a data controller can't claim ‚Äú*I* can't identify data subjects, so it's anonymous‚Äù and sell the ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù data to others. In this context, the WP136 document also considers the storage duration ‚Äì if the data is kept for a long time, future developments could make re-identification possible.",

                "body": "In the following, I will first discuss the Breyer ruling which introduces this ‚Äúlegal means‚Äù concept. I find that it is far broader than generally summarized. Subsequently, I will provide an argument that while Breyer establishes a lower bound on identifiability through IP addresses, its line of argument is not necessary under the GDPR: IP addresses are likely to be personal data regardless of legal means to obtain additional information. In particular, I will discuss the concept of ‚Äúonline identifiers‚Äù in more detail, will remark upon ‚Äúsingling out‚Äù, and will show that ‚Äúreasonably likely to be used‚Äù should be interpreted broadly, excluding only means that are unreasonable. I finish with a remark on the ICO guide.\n\n## Discussion of the Breyer ruling\n\nTo my knowledge, there have not been any more recent ECJ rulings on identifiability through IP addresses than the Breyer ruling you're citing. That ruling is subsequently cited in more recent cases such as the Opinion of the Advocate General in the Fashion ID case, but there just to note that IP addresses *can be* personal data. Whether an IP address *is* personal data in that context would be for a lower court to decide, which hasn't done so yet.\n\nSpecifically, the judgement in Breyer mentions that if the data controller is reasonably likely to have means that allow them to combine non-identifying data with other data that allows identification, then this data is personal data. Here, the court notes that there would be such means:\n\n>  German law does not allow the internet service provider to transmit directly to the online media services provider the additional data necessary for the identification of the data subject[. However], in the event of cyber attacks legal channels exist so that the online media services provider is able to contact the competent authority, so that the latter can take the steps necessary to obtain that information from the internet service provider and to bring criminal proceedings.\n>\n> Thus, it appears that the online media services provider has the means which may likely reasonably be used in order to identify the data subject, with the assistance of other persons, namely the competent authority and the internet service provider, on the basis of the IP addresses stored.\n\nNote that this finding is in no way contingent on the ‚Äúonline media services provider‚Äù being the German government. It is also not necessary for identifiability that the data controller would receive the additional information itself. In the court's finding, it is sufficient if the re-identification is performed by a ‚Äúcompetent authority‚Äù.\n\n## Limits of the Breyer ruling in light of changes between the DPD and GDPR\n\nHowever, I believe that the Breyer judgement is not entirely applicable under the GDPR. To be clear: it shows a lower bound on identifiability. If such legal means exist, the IP address is identifiable. This doesn't preclude that the IP address could also be identifying without such legal means.\n\nThe Breyer judgement says:\n\n> a dynamic IP address does not constitute information relating to an ‚Äòidentified natural person‚Äô, since such an address does not directly reveal the identity of the natural person who owns the computer from which a website was accessed, or that of another person who might use that computer.\n\n(and later discusses whether an IP address can be *indirectly identifying*, reaching the conclusion above.)\n\nI think this part is no longer as applicable, or at least misleading. IP addresses can be personal data without directly revealing the identity of a natural person.\n\n**First**, the GDPR explicitly added that **online identifiers** are an example of personal data. There is to date no case law on this term, so we only have Recital 30 to go on:\n\n> Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them.\n\nBoth ‚Äúcookie identifiers‚Äù and ‚Äúinternet protocol addresses‚Äù are explicitly called out as examples of online identifiers. While there are obviously many cookie contents and IP addresses that are clearly not personal data, I think we should assume by default that they are at least indirectly identifying. It would be up to the data controller to demonstrate the opposite in the context of their processing activities.\n\n**Second**, the GDPR added ‚Äú**singling out**‚Äù as an example of identification. You disagree with me on the interpretation of this term, but I think the GDPR consistently takes a comparatively wide view of identifiability. Let's look at Recital 26 again:\n\n> To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments.\n\nBoth the ‚Äúsingling out‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo ascertain whether means are reasonably likely ‚Ä¶‚Äù parts were added in the GDPR, and were not present in the old Data Protection Directive on which Breyer was based. There are some examples given as objective **factors that affect reasonableness**. These do not allow an overly narrow interpretation, instead requiring us to even consider future ‚Äútechnological developments‚Äù.\n\nI think this mandates a rather wide and risk-aware approach to identifiability, while merely excluding *unreasonable* scenarios like ‚Äúa supervillain builds a $100M supercomputer cluster to crack the encryption‚Äù or ‚Äúan ISP employee accidentally lost printouts with customer records in the back-alley behind a bar, where the data controller finds them and uses them for re-identification‚Äù. The referenced ICO guidance excludes scenarios with a ‚Äúslight hypothetical possibility‚Äù. Prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or outright unlikely means do not have to be considered. However, the current intentions of the data controller would not seem to be a factor, e.g. if the controller merely intends to not use available techniques that would reasonably allow identification.\n\n## Regarding the ICO guide\n\nI agree that the same information can be personal data when processed for one purpose, and non-personal when processed for other purposes. However, this should not generally be argued over the ‚Äúidentified or identifiable‚Äù aspect, but over the ‚Äúrelating to [a] data subject‚Äù part. Note that those ICO guidelines also consider a data subject directly identified or identifiable if ‚Äúyou can distinguish an individual from other individuals‚Äù, i.e. if you're able to single out a subject. It is not necessary to know the data subject's real-world identity such as their name.",

Our intention is essentially after they're 'not your customer' anymore and it's not likely they will return.  <-- how long is the billing justification here and DOES $ matter? An Order is an Order in my mind, free or not.\n* I've internally, request a periodic data Deletion Task to the Admin Team for cleaning out old records but they had more questions and I wasn't prepared for them (does $ matter, how many years exactly, to what extent is a 'meaningful action specific to our system', etc).",
