        "selftext": "Hello r/GDPR,\n\nI'm in the process of building a web analytics platform and am trying to adhere to privacy-by-design principles. I'd be grateful for a sanity check on my proposed data collection architecture.\n\nThe system is designed to operate in two distinct modes based on user consent managed by a TCF v2.2 CMP.\n\n# Mode 1: Consentless (Default Operation)\n\nThis mode runs for all users by default, without requiring consent.\n\n* Technology: No cookies, localStorage, or device fingerprinting techniques are used.\n* Data Collected & Processed: This mode involves two distinct processing activities:\n   1. For Analytics: The data stored is purely aggregated and anonymous (e.g., {page: \"/about\", referrer: \"google.com\"}).\n   2. For Security: To ensure data integrity and prevent bot traffic, we briefly process the visitor's IP address. This is done by creating a salted hash of the IP, which is held for a short period (e.g., 24 hours) for security analysis before being deleted. The full, raw IP is never stored.\n* Legal Basis: We use two separate legal bases for this mode:\n   1. For Analytics: The resulting data is truly anonymous, so the GDPR would not apply.\n   2. For Security: We process the IP address under our Legitimate Interest (Article6(1)(f)) to protect our service and ensure network security, backed by a Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA).\n\n# Mode 2: Consent (Post Opt-in)\n\nThis mode is only activated after a user gives explicit consent through the CMP for relevant purposes.\n\n* Technology: A first-party cookie is set with a unique user ID.\n* Data Collected: Detailed event streams, session data, and other personal data are collected to build behavioral profiles.\n* Legal Basis: Explicit Consent under GDPR Article6(1)(a).\n\n# My Core Compliance Questions:\n\n1. The Hybrid Model: Does this approach of running a stripped-down, consent-free analytics engine by default (with a separate, legitimate-interest-based security check) seem compliant, with personal data profiling layered on top only after acquiring consent?\n2. Data Linking Risk: My biggest question is about data history. Is it in any way compliant to associate the aggregated data collected in \"Consentless Mode\" with a user's profile once they enter \"Consent Mode\"? I believe this is a red line because it would retroactively make the 'anonymous' data identifiable, meaning it was personal data processed without a valid legal basis from the start. Am I thinking about this correctly?\n3. Unknown Unknowns: Besides the data-linking issue, what other significant compliance pitfalls should I be looking out for with this architecture?\n\nI appreciate any feedback or pointers to relevant guidance from the community. Thank you!",

The specifics you have laid out raise a number of concerns. \n\nRegarding 2. Data Linking Risk: If the data is even in-theory linkable, that indicates that it wasn't anonymous to begin with. Even if you *don't actually link it*. The fact that you *could* means it's personal data. It should not be physically possible to identify an individual in aggregated data so the fact that you're even thinking about this makes me concerned that you're not using the term \"aggregated\" correctly. If you are story non-aggregated data but only asking about aggregated data, you will get tremendously, greviously wrong advice.\n\nGenerally the main issue is that the anonymization process is still data processing. You are collecting and processing personal data, however briefly, in order to derive the aggregated and anonymous data. GDPR still applies to all of that, including e.g. the IP address and referrer and whatnot. You'll need a legal basis and suchlike.\n\nA strict reading of the ePrivacy Directive would say that it applies not just to writing data to the user's device, but also reading data that was already present. That would include the page referrer, although not the IP address. Tread lightly.\n\nIs this for your own website or is this to re-sell as a service? If you're trying to build a SaaS, then there's an entire bucket of worms around being the Processor rather than the Controller. That would include, for example, *not* deciding the Legal Basis. Big no-no. Don't do that. Thinking about the Legal Basis is for Controllers, and you don't want to be a Controller.",

This paragraph shall not prevent technical storage which is necessary for the conveyance of a communication without prejudice to the principle of confidentiality.” This is the same reason why many DPOs consider that Google’s Consent Mode V2 Advanced is unlawful since it intercepts traffic for non-essential purposes when performing its ‘cookieless ping’. \n\n[CNIL’s guidance](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-et-autres-traceurs/regles/cookies-solutions-pour-les-outils-de-mesure-daudience) is extremely specific on basic analytics, but I would believe the OPs proposed solution is close to meeting it. \n\nIt’s also important to consider that the local implementation of the ePD is not typically not extraterritorial unless it specifically states that it is. So if you’re based in France, while targeting users in the Netherlands then the compliance obligation is the ePD implementation act of France (Article 82 de la loi Informatique et Libertés) and France’s interpretation of whether consent is required, not the Netherlands.\n\nOP hasn’t, at least in their post, delineated between the first stage of assessing ePD requirements (which say whether or not consent is required for cookies or other tracking technologies- since the ePD doesn’t care about personal data) and the second stage of assessing GDPR requirements (related to processing of personal data).",

I don't understand how that can be lawful given the ePrivacy Directive, but the reality is that compliance risk differs between countries.\n\n\nA related topic to all of this is the Google Analytics Consent Mode, a mode in which GA sends back \"anonymous\" hits. My personal opinion is that Consent Mode only helps Google comply with fair competition rules, but doesn't help websites comply with GDPR or ePrivacy.",

                "body": "The ePrivacy Directive is commonly known as the \"cookie law\" and specifies when you're allowed to access or store data on the end user's device over a network (whether as cookies, LocalStorage, URL query parameters, or otherwise):\n\n* allowed if the user gave **consent**\n* allowed if the access or storage is **strictly necessary** for a service that they **explicitly requested**\n* **otherwise, forbidden**\n\nDetails and precise wording depend on the concrete EU member state you're in, as EU Directives must first be implemented as national laws.\n\nIf you are of the opinion that consent may not be required for particular client-side storage or data access, it falls upon you to make the argument that storing/accessing this information is indeed strictly necessary.\n\nFor example, storing a session ID is probably strictly necessary for a site that offers log-in functionality and when the user is logged in. CSRF tokens are probably strictly necessary. \"Personalization\" very likely is unecessary – there core features of your site that the user explicitly requested will likely work without personalization. What is necessary must always be thought from the user's perspective.\n\nSo on to your concrete questions:\n\n> 1) Do I need to request consent for them through CMP?\n\nDepends on the exact purposes of the data storage/access under these categories. You would have to show that this access/storage is strictly necessary.\n\n> 2) If not through CMP - how do I request consent for those?\n\nStick with your consent management tool.\n\nHowever, in some cases, it can make sense to avoid asking for consent in a banner where users don't have the necessary context. Instead, it can be better to ask for consent \"just in time\" as the consent becomes necessary.\n\n> 3) Are these consents talk about storage in user browser? or anywhere at all?\n> what if I store on my server -> do I still need to request consent via popup question? \n\nThe ePrivcy consent rules are about client-side storage or data access. This is commonly called the \"cookie law\", but applies to any client-side storage. It also applies when the data in question is not personal data.\n\nThese ePrivacy consent rules do not apply to server-side data processing. That doesn't automatically mean all server-side storage is legal. You'd still have to consider GDPR if the data in question is personal data (it usually is). The GDPR expects that you have a \"legal basis\", but here \"consent\" isn't the only alternative.\n\nAlso, this isn't the loophole you might think it is. Server-side storage still typically requires some client-side storage (like a session ID cookie) in order to link the data. Also, accessing data on the user's device in order to send it to the server is also subject to ePrivacy.\n\nOne topic I'm passionate about is consent-free analytics. Analytics *generally* require consent because they involve setting cookies in order to track user sessions and recurring visitors. Some analytics solutions are cookie-free, but still use a bit of JavaScript that extracts data from the browser and sends it to an analytics server – that too looks like \"accessing information over a network\" that's subject to the ePrivacy consent rules. Then, the only consent-free analytics approach would be purely server-side, e.g. doing classic 90s-style log file analysis.\n\n> I've read the google docs but they are extremely vague\n\nGoogle cannot give legal advice (and neither can I).\n\nBut you must understand Google's position as an ad network. All this documentation and features like \"consent mode\" primarily serve to insulate Google from liability. I think that the \"consent mode\" also isn't intended to help publishers with GDPR or ePrivacy compliance, but to protect Google when it comes to ad data sharing that is subject to the Digital Markets Act.",

You would have their personal data but Hubspot won't subscribe them to any lists.\n\n>With this option, *consent to process personal data* is collected implicitly when the contact clicks the submit button.\n\n>If a contact submitting the form doesn’t select the *consent to communicate* checkbox, the form submission will still be processed.

You cannot process a visitor's data and accept the form submission if they have not given explicit consent for you to do so.\n\nFor the marketing form, I would choose the second option to make consent explicit. For marketing, it is safer that the user explicitly says they want you to use their personal data for a specific purpose than relying on implicit consent.  For the first option, once you have the personal data you don't know whether you will be able to use the personal data for anything (i.e. what would be your legal basis for processing their personal data - you don't really have any you can rely on).  I would not rely on legitimate interest (because your legitimate interest for marketing would override someone rights).\n\nFor your lead form, use the second option.  Add the legitimate interest option as you want to specify that you may need to process their personal data to maintain the relationship ship (such as processing their personal data in your CRM such as assigning sale persons to the lead, recording their needs, processing email communications between you and the lead.",

To the degree that you're subject to GDPR, and to the degree that other laws like ePrivacy don't provide more specific rules, you may only process this data as necessary for a legal basis.\n\n\nUsing a third party geolocation provider may be entirely appropriate, if that provider is contractually bound to act as your data processor.\n\n\nBut if we're talking about controller-to-controller data sharing, things get much more difficult. I don't think you can do this lawfully. Compare also the structurally similar problems \"can my website load fonts from Google Fonts?\" or \"canny website embed a Facebook Like button?\".\n\n\nExcept perhaps if you can anonymize the IP addresses? Country-level geolocation does not need the full IP, just the corresponding ASN block (at least for IPv4, I'm less sure about IPv6). That information is public, so you may be able to chop off part of the IP address before querying a third party API from your backend.

If you are sending it to a 3rd party, even worse, because now you are required to understand how that 3rd party handles data under gdpr.\n\n- Legitimate interest?\nMaybe if you are outside EU, and you have mixed US, Asia, EU, etc. customers you could claim that it is necessary.But again, you really need a dpa with that 3rd party.\n\n- IPs are always available.\nTrue, the internet depends on that.

You dont need consent to allow ips to connect. Processing however...\n\n- Geolocation isn t accurate\nWhether the person is behind a proxy, or at work, it does not really matter.

In fact, the same document also says:\n\n>“Controllers are free to develop methods to comply with this provision in a way that is fitting in their daily operations. At the same time, the duty to demonstrate that valid consent has been obtained by a controller should not in itself lead to excessive amounts of additional data processing. This means that controllers should have enough data to show a link to the processing (to show consent was obtained), but they shouldn’t be collecting any more information than necessary.”\n\n**So my questions are:**\n\n* Have any of you implemented a consent log in your own cookie consent solution?\n* What are your thoughts on how best to demonstrate consent?",

Consent is only one of many legal bases, with an important alternative being a legitimate interest (LI). LI requires you to do a balancing test between that interest and the affected person's rights (write the balancing test down!). So (other than for cookies) it is usually sufficient to provide transparent information about what you're doing, and to offer an opt-out where appropriate. Consent management tools often support legitimate interest opt-outs as well, though you will need to wire the consent management tool up accordingly. It's unlikely a no-code platform can do that :)\n\nOn using (international) data processors, i.e. outsourcing some activities to another company:\n\n* You need a contract with them that binds them to only use the data for your purposes, not for their own purposes. This is often called a “data processing addendum” or something like that. Sometimes included in the normals terms of service, but often a separate document. E.g. in Google Analytics you can sign a DPA in the account settings.\n* International transfers of personal data require disclosure in your privacy policy, and additional protections (e.g. Standard Contractual Clauses). Your life will be easier if you can avoid non-EU services.\n* The US do not offer an adequate level of data protection (see the Schrems II judgement). Privacy Shield is no longer valid. In theory nearly all uses of US services are forbidden in the EU, in practice this isn't yet enforced very strictly. In Germany, this depends very much on your state. E.g. I remember Berlin and MeckPom taking a harder stance on this issue, with Bavaria being more flexible.\n* Furthermore, US-based services often only have so-so features that aid with compliance. If a website builder can't defer certain actions until consent was given, that is a component.\n\nInstead of an US-based “no code” website builder, consider renting a managed Wordpress instance in the EU. Wordpress is extremely flexible and can do most things without having to code. But unfortunately this depends on third-party themes and plugins with very uneven quality.",

Per Art 13, you're only required to list “the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any” which includes your data processors.\n\n> I'm going with a managed WP from \\[redacted]\n\nI didn't mention WP because WP is so amazing, but because it allows you to avoid US-based services. As mentioned above, the US do not offer an adequate level of data protection, so it's a bit challenging to argue that you can send traffic there (said the Reddit user, writing on a US-based website…). *Technically* the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are still valid (which are often incorporated into a DPA), but in reality everyone knows that they are ineffective for transfers into the US. I previously said Bavaria was more chill about this, but today I learned that it [told one company to stop using Mailchimp](https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2021/bavarian-dpa-baylda-calls-german-company-cease-use-mailchimp-tool_en), an US-based company that suggests to use SCCs.\n\nEvery service says it's GDPR-compliant. But you are the data controller and you have to make the determination whether *you* can use their services in a GDPR-compliant manner.\n\nAlso, any hosting that requires you to pay > €10/month for a basic low-traffic WP installation is ripping you off :)  \nAnother common pricing trap is to charge separately for SSL certificates.\n\n> configuring Google Analytics to be cookie-less\n\nThis is indeed possible, just be aware that GA will generate a new client ID on each page load, so that user = session = pageview in your statistics. The feature to [disable cookies is documented for analytics.js](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookies-user-id#disabling_cookies), but there's an equivalent undocumented feature for gtag.js:\n\n    gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', {\n      'anonymize_ip': true,\n      'client_storage': 'none'  // do not set cookies\n    });\n\nAlso, GA is another US-based data processor :)\n\n> For the Impressum and Privacy Policy I can pay some generators, right?\n\nYes, though a free one might be sufficient. If you can live with a bit of risk, it's also quite feasible to look at the TMG and GDPR and provide that information yourself. The Impressum requirements get more important for Kaufmänner, since there's a thriving Abmahnindustrie.\n\n> do you have a preferred charity\n\nThank you for being so thoughtful.

However, non-US persons that are affected by US surveillance have no realistic way to sue the US government. This violates the rule of law (Rechtsstaatlichkeit).\n\nIn the particular case regarding Mailchimp, the immediate issue was that the company hadn't assessed whether the transfers were still lawful and which supplemental measures would have to be taken to make it lawful. Since the company had just used Mailchimp for a couple of tests but didn't actively rely on it, they found it easier to just stop using it.\n\nMost of the industry just pretends that SCCs are a valid basis to continue such international transfers. It is technically true that SCCs were not invalidated by Schrems II, but there is a duty to ensure that the non-EU party is actually able to comply with this contract. While I can't recommend it with good conscience, you wouldn't be the first to just sign SCCs and be done with it.\n\n> if I should get \"caught\" […] there is no punishment involved but a notification\n\n*Typically* the data protection authorities don't immediately issue a fine.

Google Tag Manager.\n\nThe cookie banner is a clear case, so let's skip to GTM. The court says that because GTM downloads a script 'gtm.js' and stores that on the client, that's against the ePrivacy directive. That's a very narrow interpretation and would basically mean that _any_ Javascript you load from any server would need consent, unless it is absolutely necessary to provide the site (which is almost never is in the case of scripts, as you can very well just provide a plain HTML site), as the browser will always 'download and store' the Javascript. I understand that the ePrivacy directive can be read this narrowly, but it creates a legal uncertainty where almost every website could be in breach of the ePrivacy directive.\n\nAnother reason they give is that Google is processing data (the IP address). That's true, but Google can just be a processor of the website provider. The transfer to the US is also allowed under the Data Privacy Framework. So the fact that it's Google is not relevant.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I would really like to see GTM-usage being banned. But I would really have preferred if that decision was either based on 1.) Transfer of data to the US (e.g., invalidating DPF and/or usage of SCCs) or 2.) The fact that Google does further processing of the data and does not act strictly as a processor (which is probably the case, but was not proven in this case, they merely state that Google's business model is to process a lot of personal data).",

Ultimately, this judgment is not about GTM, but about consent.\n\nThe judgment is not quite making the argument that the *downloading* of the `gtm.js` script itself is storage of information, and thus subject to the ePrivacy rules. Instead, it says that this GTM script *performs* access/storage of information, which is then subject to ePrivacy, even when GTM hasn't loaded any 3rd party tags yet.\n\nBtw, the EDPB does promote a fairly narrow interpretation of access and storage of information in their [Guidelines 2/2023 on Technical Scope of Art. 5(3) of ePrivacy Directive](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-22023-technical-scope-art-53-eprivacy-directive_en). For example, they argue that even transient storage in RAM counts as storage for the purpose of this law. But the EDPB doesn't see the downloading as a script or HTML page as storage, unless that download acts as a tracking pixel.\n\nThe international data transfer aspect kind of gets lost between all the text. The key points are as follows, but they're analogous to the GDPR consent problem.\n\n* The case was filed in late 2022, before the DPF came into force.\n* The website connected to the US-based GTM servers upon page load.\n  * This is an international data transfer.\n  * This is also processing of personal data, requiring a legal basis.\n* The consent banner requested consent to international data transfers per Art. 49(1)(a). This was too late, as the transfer had already happened at that point. Any consent was also invalid, because this detail was hidden below the fold.\n* For the processing of personal data, none of Art 6(1)(a) \"consent\", Art 6(1)(c) \"legal obligation\", or Art 6(1)(f) \"legitimate interest\" apply.\n  * Legal obligations are completely off.\n  * Any consent would come too late.\n  * The three-step legitimate interest balancing test fails because using GTM is neither necessary (there are less invasive alternatives), nor does the legitimate interest outweigh the data subjects' rights and interests.\n\nAll of this, and especially the legitimate interest aspect, is reminiscent of the infamous “Google Fonts” case. But there's a key difference. I believe the Google Fonts thing would have to be decided differently if Google were  to act as a data processor. But for this GTM case, it doesn't matter that much how the script was *served* (beyond the Art 49 issues), and the focus is more on what this script *does*.\n\nI'm also not sure when, if ever, Google acts as a processor for GTM? There are [GTM terms of service](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7157428) which explain that Google may use some of the data, but also that GTM customers [may enter into a data processing agreement](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7207086), though [the agreement doesn't discuss GTM](https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/).",

Either wait and see how it shakes out or approach your boss and (very kindly, very gently) tell her you are a little uncomfortable. Rather than accusing her of doing something wrong, focus on how you experienced it.

The project looks at how people and communities can trade electricity directly with each other think neighbors selling excess solar power or batteries helping balance the grid while still protecting privacy and building digital trust.\n\nMy own focus is on the legal side of energy data:\n\t1. Who actually controls or “owns” the data from smart meters, inverters, and community apps?\n\t2. How do EU laws like the Data Act and GDPR shape what households, energy communities, and third-party platforms can do with this data?\n\t3. Can we design models where households stay in control of their own energy data, but sharing still happens fairly and securely when needed (for example, with the grid operator or an energy community app)?\n\nThe big picture goal is to explore decentralized, community based energy systems where privacy and data rights are respected, instead of everything being centralized with big utilities.\n\nWe’re starting with Norway, but the ideas apply across Europe.\n\nI’d love to hear what you think: would you feel comfortable sharing your energy data with neighbors or community apps if you had clear rights and controls?",

Depends what country you’re in, in the UK smart meter data belongs to Smart DCC, which is a subsidiary of Capita, which is running a public service on behalf of the Government. Access to the Smart DCC data was very painful to obtain as they were not very innovative at the time.\n\nTypically, the data is managed by a centralised body/business operating on behalf of the Government who provide the smart meter data to the energy company/companies. That’s unless you have a public energy provider, where the data owner and the energy provider are the same. You can ask the occupier for regular meter updates, but that’s less convenient than an API endpoint to request the data. \n\nFor inverters on the property, the home occupier is responsible for this, so provided you have an integration then the occupier is likely responsible for implementing that connection. \n\nThe EU Data Act enables residents to request their data or have their data made available in some form, but the application to public utilities is likely to be somewhat limited. \n\nCan you design a model? Sure. I don’t think the issue here is if you can, or even if you should, it’s a matter of scale for the investment it’s going to take to get to the point of being able to make it operable. This is firmly something that a DNO will argue you should not be doing and interrupting the network in this could potentially be unlawful, but if a DNO were to host it under one of their innovation programs, then it would assist your project massively.",

I think that it's ultimately an economic issue that makes the general answer 'no'; the marginal on a kWh of electricity is just too small to use a system with very high overheads like the blockchain. On the other hand a battery will effectively 'anonymize' domestic electricity use by flattening the import and export curves to the point that you won't be able to see the impact of behavior on electricity consumption. \n\nI would look at the wreckage in the market though; there have been a lot of commercial developments in the general area, including some, I believe, incorporating blockchains. In terms of 'rules', there are actually no real 'rules' in an energy community, other than the DSO's network restrictions; there's really just accounting. Energy sharing arrangements under the recast Directive aren't even 'balance responsible' in the market from my interpretation. \n\nData protection laws are really to facilitate all this without the individual consumer putting themselves at risk. \n\nI think there is a lot of room here for assessing the impacts on data protection and seeing if there's ways to mitigate the risks (which there certainly are).",

        "selftext": "Afternoon all\n\nI am an officer in a sports club for an \"extreme sport\".  The sports club is subject to governance by a national governing body (NGB), which all club members (and constituting clubs) must belong to.  The NGB has just transitioned to a new web service for member management, including training and qualifications. \n\nOne of my club members is also a member of another club.  He is a qualified instructor and can award members qualifications through the new web service.  He brought to my attention that as an instructor, he has access to all personal information of members held on the web service, in every club in which he is a member.  This is information such as name and address, mobile phone number and email address.\n\nIt appears this is set by default for all instructors, and confirmed by other club members who are in my club.  The issue which gave rise to concern was that the club member who brought this to my attention noticed that he was provided with information of a member of another club who is a minor.  In his view, and in mine, this constitutes a GDPR breach and a safeguarding near miss.  There is no need for my club member to see the personal contact details of other club members, in our or any other club.  Should a training need arise for contact then that information should be shared with consent.  \n\nI submitted a formal notification to the NGB and have just received the response, copied below but anonymised because I don't want to publicly throw the NGB under the bus:\n\n>We have investigated your complaint and have looked into the issue thoroughly.  We can confirm that (instructor), according to our systems (new and old), was an active member of (other club), hence having access to the individual you identified as (minor).\n\n>(NGB) took legal advice on the data set up and this was cleared, many other NGBs use the same system set up via (provider). The data is set up as detailed in our GDPR policy and for the stated purposes. Contact and qualification data is only visible to officers and fully qualified instructors within their own club or clubs and does include U18 information if there are Juniors within the club.  \n\n> **Why Instructors Need Access to Member Info**\n\n> To deliver safe and effective training, instructors have a responsibility to follow (NGB) standards and make sure students are properly supported. To do this, they may need to:\n\n> 1.         Check that a student’s (NGB) membership is up to date\n\n> 2.         See what training a student has completed or still needs\n\n> 3.         Record progress or sign off lessons\n\n> 4.         Contact a student about their training using their name and email address\n\n> 5.         Have access to a student’s emergency contact details\n\n> Instructors are trusted volunteers in the club and play a key role—especially those who are (NGB) Nationally Qualified Instructors (NQIs). They’re expected to use this information responsibly, just like reading a student’s training record in the club file.\n\n> All data use is logged and should only be for (NGB) training purposes. Any misuse of this information would be taken very seriously.\n\n> However we have taken your comments on board and are looking at options to rectify concerns about instructors access to personal data, albeit lawfully.\n\n> Kind regards\n\n My concerns remain:\n\n* There is an encouragement, not a requirement, for instructors to have a valid DBS certificate.  MY club member is aware of the DBS process as his partner works in the care field, but does not hold a DBS certificate.  Most NGB instructors do not.  \n* Regardless of the advice the NGB has claimed to receive, there has been an unlawful disclosure of personal information of a third party because it was without their consent and there was no lawful need or requirement for my club member to see or use it.  \n* The service remains designed to provide open access to personal information by default, contrary to Article 25 of the 2018 Regulations.  The fact they have restricted my club member's access to his own club, this one time, and following my referral, does not address the systemic design failure in access to records for all NGB instructors, of which there are over 1,000.  \n* The above copy-pasted response (I am aware of a number of other individuals who have raised concerns about their own personal information being shared without without consent) claims that instructors are expected to behave responsibly with personal information, yet no data protection training is provided as part of the NGB instructor training regime.    \n* The issue of a minor's personal contact information being shared without their knowledge with someone who has no need to access it remains unresolved.  \n* The information being held doesn't actually include emergency contact details, which given the extreme sports nature of the organisation, is what would be of most use!\n\nI used to be a senior leader in a voluntary youth organisation which managed all young persons' information via a web service.  There were extremely rigid yet very sensible rules about who had access to what.  This broad level of access to childrens' records would have resulted in the a service shutdown until it was resolved.  \n\nMy question\n\nAm I way off base here?  Is the \"access by default\" for instructors, as big a deal as I think it is?  I am fairly confident a breach is still occurring and whilst I am neither the person in the organisation responsible for reporting, nor the subject of the complaint, I want to be fairly confident in where I stand before I take this to the ICO, as it is definitely going to cause relationship issues between my club and the NGB if I do.

Instead, your website should only load or enable compliance-sensitive features after the CMP has indicated that consent was given.\n\nSome tools offer such blocking functionality in order to help a blatantly non-compliant site to become more compliant, without requiring the site operator to have programming skills.

But the issue I see here goes deeper.\n\nIf the CMP script is blocked, like in the case with [goadopt.io](http://goadopt.io) being listed in the EasyPrivacy filter, then the banner doesn't load at all. That also means the script can't do its job: blocking cookies or managing consent signals (like Google Consent Mode v2). So, even if the user hasn't consented, cookies might still be set because the logic that should prevent them isn’t even running.\n\nSure, most users who block cookie banners also block cookies, but I don't think we can assume that for everyone. Imagine a user that only blocks the CMP script (either intentionally or because it's bundled in a filter list), and suddenly cookies are set without any consent at all.\n\nIn my eyes, that’s not GDPR-compliant, or at the very least, it's sitting in a legal grey area. The support from AdOpt argues that it's not my responsibility if a user blocks the CMP, but I find that risky. If the CMP’s role is to manage and enforce consent, but it doesn’t even load, then it’s hard to argue that compliance is truly being met.",

The GDPR doesn’t care why the consent mechanism failed - only that no data is processed without valid consent.\n\n\"Best effort\" is not enough. You need a privacy setup that holds up even if in edge cases.\n\nMaybe also think about using tools which don´t need consent and don´t set cookies.

I haven't decided which yet but I just had a question around GDPR policy for each option.\n\nOption 1 - B2B lead generation for waste management. Information shared with existing waste management partners would be the business contact person, their business email, phone number and the service/site address. I would only ever share information with the specific persons consent. How would I devise a suitable policy for this? Is there any standardised wording I can use or does it need to be specific to number of partners who receive the information, industry, method of communication etc. Information would be gathered from prospects primarily through inbound channels but will also include some cold outreach to prospects.\n\nOption 2 - B2B freelance sales within waste management. I would not be sharing customer information with partners the same way as Option 1 but would be signing customers up directly to one service as a contractor which means that I would have to pass on contact information as well as contract information such as direct debit details. Would I need any kind of GDPR policy for this since I'm not sharing information but rather signing customers up to a service whilst acting for one supplier?\n\nTIA",

Here's a detailed breakdown based on their policies, technical analyses, and regulatory findings:\n\n### 🔍 1. **Data Collection Practices**\nDeepSeek collects three main categories of data:  \n- **User-Provided Data**: Account details (email, phone number), chat inputs (\"Prompts\"), uploaded files, and feedback .  \n- **Automated Collection**: IP addresses, device identifiers, location (approximated via IP), cookies, and usage logs .  \n- **Third-Party Sources**: Data from social logins (e.g., Google/Apple) and security partners .  \n\n⚠️ **Controversies**:  \n- South Korea's PIPC found DeepSeek collected keystroke patterns (though later retracted) and transferred user prompts to Chinese servers without consent .  \n- Independent tests revealed collection of device names (e.g., \"John's iPhone\"), which could de-anonymize users .  \n\n### 🌐 2. **Data Usage and Sharing**\n- **Primary Uses**: Service delivery, model training, security monitoring, and compliance with legal requests .  \n- **Third-Party Sharing**:  \n  - **Volcengine** (ByteDance subsidiary): Received device info, network data, and user prompts until blocked in April 2025 .  \n  - **Service Providers**: Analytics (Google), security (Fengkong Cloud), and infrastructure partners .  \n  - **Corporate Group**: Entities in China/U.S. for R&D and storage .  \n\n*Table: Key Data Sharing Practices*  \n| **Recipient**       | **Data Shared**                          | **Purpose**                     | **Location** |  \n|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|  \n| Volcengine           | Device info, user prompts               | Security/UI optimization        | China        |  \n| Fengkong Cloud       | Device profiling, network data          | Fraud prevention                | China        |  \n| Google Analytics     | Usage logs, device details              | Analytics                       | U.S.         |  \n\n### 🛡️ 3. **Security Flaws**\nMultiple critical vulnerabilities were identified:  \n- **Unencrypted Transmissions**: User data sent in plain text (HTTP), disabling iOS security features like App Transport Security .  \n- **Weak Encryption**: Use of deprecated 3DES algorithm with hardcoded keys and reused initialization vectors .  \n- **Insecure Storage**: Cached databases exposed usernames, passwords, and encryption keys .  \n- **Device Fingerprinting**: Aggressive data collection (e.g., language settings, device models) enabling user tracking .  \n\n### ⚖️ 4. **Regulatory Compliance Issues**\n- **South Korea**: Banned new downloads (Feb 2025) for non-consensual data transfers to China/U.S. Recommended destroying illegally transferred data and appointing a local agent .  \n- **Italy**: Blocked DeepSeek for GDPR violations, citing insufficient transparency and data storage in China .  \n- **EU Concerns**: Ireland's DPC launched inquiries into data handling for EU users .  \n\n### 🕹️ 5. **User Controls and Rights**\n- **Opt-Out Options**: Users can delete chat history but cannot opt out of data collection for model training without disabling accounts .  \n- **Rights Requests**: Limited access/correction rights; data deletion may not extend to training datasets .  \n- **Age Verification**: Added after PIPC flagged child data risks, but effectiveness unclear .  \n\n### 💡 Key Concerns from Experts\n- **\"You Are the Product\"**: Free access trades for broad data exploitation, including commercial/personal inputs .  \n- **Chinese Legal Exposure**: Data stored in China subject to government access under national security laws .  \n- **Enterprise Risks**: U.S. military, NASA, and banks banned DeepSeek due to intellectual property theft risks .  \n\n### 🔚 Conclusion  \nWhile DeepSeek claims compliance in updated policies (e.g., adding Korean translations and opt-outs), its history of non-consensual data transfers, weak security, and storage under Chinese jurisdiction make it high-risk. Users handling sensitive data should avoid the platform, while enterprises must enforce strict bans. For casual use, limit inputs to non-personal content and regularly delete history.  \n\nFor regulatory documents or technical reports, refer to the [PIPC findings](https://www.pipc.go.kr)  or [NowSecure analysis](https://www.nowsecure.com) .”",

Under PECR that then references **GDPRs** definition of \"consent\", you MUST obtain explicit consent at the point of collection if you intend to use a customer's email for marketing purposes.\n\nSome companies argue, *\"It’s in our terms and conditions,\"* and therefore claim they have consent. However, this is not deemed to be explicit consent, and if you check the ICO website, it explicitly states that this is not acceptable.\n\n>your consent requests **must** be ‘clearly distinguishable from other matters’ — ie they **must not** be bundled as part of terms and conditions wherever possible;\n\nReference: [https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guidance-on-the-use-of-storage-and-access-technologies/what-are-the-rules/#what\\_does\\_consent\\_mean](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guidance-on-the-use-of-storage-and-access-technologies/what-are-the-rules/#what_does_consent_mean)\n\nSome businesses claim the soft opt-in exception applies (meaning the customer has bought a product/service from you recently). However, to rely on this, you still must have given them a clear chance to opt out at the time of collection. It sounds like your company is not doing this, which makes their approach non-compliant.\n\nIf customers are led to believe their email is solely for a receipt or returns but are then added to a marketing list without explicit agreement, this is misleading and unlawful. If reported, the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) should take enforcement action against your company.\n\nHOWEVER, my experience is that they won’t. They simply do not have the time or inclination to take action on every complaint. What they will do is log it as a complaint against the company, and if that company starts appearing frequently in their complaint data, they may consider taking action if there is sufficient evidence of a breach.\n\nI completely agree that this is unethical. Clearly, you have a strong moral conscience and respect for others—thank you, we need more people like this in society.\n\nBut is this the hill you want to die on? I suspect that raising this with your employer is unlikely to do you any favours. It is far more likely to damage any chances you have of progression or development within that company.\n\nMy professional advice: go in guns blazing—this kind of practice drives me crazy.\n\nMy personal advice: keep your head down, report it to the ICO, keep evidence (though you’re unlikely to need it), and play the corporate game. If you don’t like it, vote with your feet and move to a different employer—but bad news: most retail companies are doing this.",

And even if you've been there longer, they can make things difficult.)\n\nSo I would very strongly NOT suggest raising this to management any more, or even changing what you say to customers (if that's something your manager might hear). \n\nYou could just go straight to the ICO with a complaint yourself. \n\nOr you could get a friend/acquaintance to complain to the ICO, after buying something and getting marketing emails. (This might be a better option if it's a small organisation, and/or it's been very obvious you've been making a fuss about this.)\n\nI might well be worrying too much - but having had some bad workplace experiences myself, I know it's very rarely worth making an obvious fuss about something, however well-intentioned.

Here, the EDPB focuses its further analysis on \"very large online platforms\" in the sense of the Digital Services Act (and \"gatekeepers\" in the sense of the Digital Markets Act). These platforms do not have a real alternative. If I decline to use Facebook, then I'm locked out of a large part of public life. So these VLOPs merit close scrutiny when thinking about how large of a fee (if any) may be charged as an alternative to giving consent. Here, the application of data protection law is closely intertwined with fair competition law.\n\nThe analysis is more complicated when we're looking at smaller online services, as these competition law factors become less prominent. It's fairly easy to argue that Facebook's paid tier was manipulative bullshit, it is more difficult to argue that the various Zeit Online subscription tiers are impermissible.\n\nPersonally, I believe that Pay or OK is in principle permissible as long as the paid tier and ad-supported tier are balanced to be of equivalent value.\n\n* However, the paid tiers are often many times more expensive than the lost ad revenue they allegedly replace. To me, this *looks* like they often aren't intended as a realistic alternative, but as a manipulation tactic to coerce people into giving consent – often to exploit the \"decoy effect\" to drive consumers to a higher-priced subscription with added features.\n* This also runs into problems of \"granularity\". A website will often ask for consent for multiple different purposes, and the GDPR expects that data subjects can decide to which purposes they give consent. However, Pay or OK is often structured as an all-or-nothing approach.",

        "selftext": "I'd be grateful for some guidance on the potential breach aspects of this scenario:\n\nI raised a complaint to my employer that a verbal meeting I had with two managers had been recorded. Long story short, a very detailed record, tantamount to a verbatim transcript, was made by them, and documented on my HR record. \n\nI was not told any notes or transcript was being taken. The content of their write up omits key information. The topic was my health, diagnosis of a disability, and the entire thing was a disagreement about aspects of this. I was not offered the record to scrutinise, and consider it innacurate. I believe it it is fundamentally special category data. \n\nI only learned if it by way of a DSAR request. I've since learned the original document remained stored on the personal drive of one of the managers, named incorrectly, and the contents cut and pasted in a Teams message to the other manager for them to quality assure. The original draft transcript can be evidenced to have been edited, and the final version is therefore a biased account of the discussion. My position is that the meeting was a formal capability meeting by stealth, but they claim it was an 'informal meeting', so weren't required to tell me the record was being made, nor give me the chance to take my own notes or have anyone present to assist. They document it elsewhere as being a 'welfare discussion', which is not a formal title with any definition. It ran for nearly an hour after saying it would be a 15 min chat, and resulted in the most detailed transcript I've ever seen. Routine and inconsequential 121s always had notes, but this exceeded those by nearly 400% in equivalent content.\n\nI've also learned that during the meeting one manager made notes for themselves on topics to cover, but did it in a Teams message to the other which they 'accidentally' sent. They also admit to storing notes of this and other meetings for 'their own records to refer back to', including disability-realted absence meetings.\n\nSo, no 'breach' in terms of my data being leaked externally etc. However, it seems to me this whole debacle falls down on just about every principle; transparency, accuracy and so on. Does the sharing of the notes via Teams, plus accidental sharing of a message, count as a leak of some form? Granted both parties were in the meeting anyway, but on what basis were they providing each other with a document of it to store and save? If nothing else it demonstrates a massive risk of data loss, i.e. could have cut and paste into the wrong conversation and hit send.\n\nThere was no reason not to get my consent, and to have not done so, they need to rely on another point in law do they not? And if they do so, don't they effectively admit they were running a formal process, as per my allegation it was a formal capability meeting by stealth? Otherwise, why does the record of the meeting exist? Does failing to adhere to the principles, and being lax with storage and sharing etc, amount to an objective offence in some way, or just 'bad practice', a near miss and 'do better next time'?\n\nThis all forms part of a much wider grievance, but as a standalone I'd like to get to grips with the specific angle around data breach, especially as it concerns special category data.

Once a US organisation has been certified and is publicly placed onto the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) List on the DPF website, they can receive UK personal data through a UK-US data bridge without the need for further safeguards set out in the UK GDPR. Google is on the list.  \n\nHere’s what we say in our data protection policy:\nThe GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA in most circumstances in order to ensure that the level of data protection afforded to individuals by the GDPR is not undermined. In this context, a “transfer” of personal data includes transmitting, sending, viewing or accessing personal data in or to a different country.\nWe may only transfer personal data outside of the EEA if one of the following conditions applies:\n1. The European Commission has issued an “adequacy decision” confirming that the\ncountry to which we propose transferring the personal data ensures an adequate\nlevel of protection for the rights and freedoms of individuals\n2. Appropriate safeguards are in place, such as binding corporate rules, standard\ncontractual clauses that have been approved by the European Commission or an\napproved code of conduct or certification mechanism \n3. The individual has given their explicit consent to the proposed transfer, having been\nfully informed of any potential risks\n4. The transfer is necessary in order to perform a contract between us and\nthe data subject, for reasons of public interest, to establish, exercise or defend legal\nclaims or to protect the vital interests of the individual in circumstances where they\nare in incapable of giving consent\n\nThank you.",

In this particular case you are not obliged to tell data subjects about what the law says, and especially since you're not concluding anything. \n\nYou are obliged to tell data subjects about transfers (including to third countries), but not the legal method used to reach the conclusion that it is legal. \n\nIF the companies mentioned (Google and the recruitment) are certified under the privacy framework (presuming the UK actually implemented it as well), you can go right ahead with the transfer and you don't need to do a TIA. Check that they are certified to the correct data (HR or non-HR as the case may be). Obviously you still need to comply with all other requirements concerning using a data processor, but at vi least certification with the data privacy framework makes it so that there are no practical differences between US based and EU based processing.\n\nIf they are not certified for the particular data you need, don't.\n\nThe above applies until we get schrems 3 where the privacy framework is likely to get nuked...again...",

They did this entirely on their own; they were not asked by the organisation to do this. They have since shared the content with HR, as well as their line manager. They now want to share this with their own family and friends as they think it could be useful in their personal life too.\n\nHad they not shared with it with HR (with it now likely being part of their employee file) I think there was a strong argument that they were doing this for their own purposes, and not the organisations. However, given it is now likely in their HR file, does this create any issue in sharing externally? There's now a good argument that the organisation is also determining the purposes. The content has also been produced on company headed documents. Is consent a simple solution here?\n\n  \nThoughts appreciated!",

The platform can be used by beauty center owner only, so no customers has an app. The platform allows registering customer information like name, surname and phone number. The phone number is used to send reminder 24h before.\n\nThe question is: should I request the customers to be agreed to use they phone number to send them a reminder? If yes, what is the best approach? I'm thinking to develop a flow where the owner of beauty center add a new customer by asking it the information and then the platform send a sms with an URL to a webpage where the customer can read the privacy policy and can check a box to give the consensus to use their phone number.\n\nUntil the customer not approve the webpage the customer info are stored to platform but is not usable and will be delete after 7 days. Sounds reasonable? Or can the owner not enter customer information until he reads the privacy policy and gives consent?\n\nThanks",

First of all, you are processor for the beauty centers and they are the controller and need to obtain a legal basis for processing the data.\n\nI think you could argue the performance of the contract (between the customer and the beauty center) needs a reminder and thus art. 6(1)(b) GDPR could already be the legal basis. It's not too different from the 'your package has been shipped' emails you get when you order something online.\n\nEven if you argue that the reminder is not strictly necessary to perform the contract, the beauty center will have a legitimate interest to send the reminders, as otherwise customers might not show up. In that case it would be nice to allow them to object to this and give them the option to turn it off (also keeping art. 21 GDPR in mind), and to be honest I would offer that option in all cases.\n\nNote that this whole situation may change as soon as your reminder is more than just a reminder: if it starts to look like a marketing message in any way, or if you start reminding people that it's time to visit the beauty center again, you may have to start taking the e-Privacy directive and other relevant local anti-spam laws into account.\n\nAlso note that this post is not legal advice and that you should consult your own lawyer if you want definitive answers.",

They are not related. Neither removes a subjects ability to request deletion, but LI does not require consent to process whereas consent (unsurprisingly), does.\n\nIf the latter - a photograph taken by you is your copyrighted work of art. It'd be a pretty tyrannical court that decided you didn't have a legitimate interest to publish that art, unless the taking and distribution of the photograph itself was illegal (for example CSAM) or the purpose for which you published the photograph was illegal (harassment).\n\nAre you perhaps getting confused between the difference between consent required prior to processing (if any) and a processor's requirement to honour a subject deletion request?

        "selftext": "It’s been wonderful to see the growth of this community over many years, with so many great posts and so many great responses from helpful community members. But with scale also come challenges. The following updates are intended to keep the community helpful and focused:\n\n* Rules have been clarified around recurring issues (appropriate conduct, advertising, AI-generated content).  \n* Post flairs have been updated to align better with actual posts.  \n* Community members are invited to become moderators.\n\n## New rules (effective 2025-02-02)\n\n1. **Be kind and helpful.** Community members are expected to conduct themselves professionally. Discussion should be constructive and guiding. Personal attacks will not be tolerated.  \n2. **Stay on topic.** The r/gdpr subreddit is about European data protection. This includes relevant EU and UK laws (GDPR, ePrivacy, PECR, …) and matters concerning data protection professionals (e.g. certifications). General privacy topics or other laws are out of scope.  \n3. **No legal advice.** Do not offer or solicit legal advice.  \n4. **No self-promotion or spamming.** This subreddit is meant to be a resource for GDPR-related information. It is not meant to be a new avenue for marketing. Do not promote your products or services through posts, comments, or DMs. Do not post market research surveys.  \n5. **Use high-quality sources.** Posts should link to original sources. Avoid low-quality “blogspam”. Avoid social media and video content. Avoid paywalled (or consent-walled) material.  \n6. **Don’t post AI slop.** This is a place for people interested in data protection to have discussions. Contribute based on your expertise as a human. If we wanted to read an AI answer, we could have asked ChatGPT directly. LLM-generated responses on GDPR questions are often “confidently incorrect”, which is worse than being wrong.  \n7. **Other.** These rules are not exhaustive. Comply with the spirit of the rules, don't lawyer around them. Be a good Redditor, don't act in a manner that most people would perceive as unreasonable.\n\nYou can find background and detailed explanations of these rules in our wiki:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules/)  \n* [https://old.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules)\n\nPlease provide feedback on these rules.\n\n* Should some of these rules be relaxed?  \n* Is something missing? Did you recently experience problems on r/gdpr that wouldn’t be prohibited by these rules?  \n* What are your opinions on whether the UK Data Protection Act 2018 should be in scope?\n\n## Post flairs\n\nThere used to be post flairs “Question \\- Data Subject” and “Question \\- Data Controller”. These were rarely used in a helpful manner.\n\nIn their place, you can now use post flairs to indicate the relevant country.\n\nWith that change, the current set of post flairs is:\n\n* **EU 🇪🇺:** for questions and discussions relating primarily to the EU GDPR  \n* **UK 🇬🇧:** for questions and discussions that are UK-specific  \n* **News:** posts about recent developments in the GDPR space, e.g. recent court cases  \n* **Resource**  \n* **Analysis**  \n* **Meta:** for posts about the r/gdpr subreddit, such as this announcement\n\nThis update is only about post flairs. User flairs are planned for some future time.\n\n## Call for moderators\n\nTo help with the growing community, I’d ask for two or three community members to step up as moderators. Moderating r/gdpr is very low-effort most of the time, but there is the occasional post that attracts a wider audience, and I’m not always able to stay on top of the modqueue in a timely manner.\n\nRequirements for new moderators:\n\n* You find a large reserve of kindness and empathy within you.  \n* You have at least basic knowledge of the GDPR.  \n* You intend to participate in r/gdpr as normal and continue to set a good example.  \n* You can spare about 15 minutes per week, ideally from a desktop computer.  \n* You can comply with the [Reddit Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct), which has become a lot more stringent in the wake of the 2023 API protests.\n\nIf you’d like to serve as a ~~community janitor~~ moderator, please send a modmail with subject “moderator application from \\<your\\_username\\>”. I’ll probably already know your name from previous interactions on this subreddit, so not much introduction needed beyond your confirmation that you meet these requirements.\n\n**Edit:** Applications will stay open until at least 2025-02-08 (end of day UTC), so that all potential candidates have time to see this post.\n\n## Call for feedback\n\nPlease feel free to use the comments to discuss the above rule changes, or any other aspect of how r/gdpr is being managed. In particular, I’d like to hear ideas on how we can encourage the posting of more news content, as the subreddit sometimes feels more like a GDPR helpdesk.\n\nPrevious mod post: [r/GDPR will be unavailable starting June 12th due to the Reddit API changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/14763xl/rgdpr_will_be_unavailable_starting_june_12th_due/) \\[2023-06-11\\]",

The customer profile is a just a customer and might exist for a website or more, but without interconnection between the websites.\n\nWell basically my questions are these:\n\n* What should I do, first of all, with my clients data (users registered directly to my platform)? What if they upload content that violates the ToS? \n* What happens if a user wants to delete data that was public? Should I directly delete the data at their wish? Or am I legally able to keep data for a certain period of time, to make sure that in case of legal cases, I'm able to say \"this guy did this and that on my platform, here's the evidence, here's what he uploaded at XYZ in time\". \n* What about content that changed in time? A user creates an illegal websites (how to make drugs at home i.e). After one week he changes it to be a shoes e-commerce. Should I keep copy of different versions of the website during time? What are my actual responsibilities in this case? Am I liable to be the service offer that allowed the customer to upload such content?\n* What about my clients' customers? The clients manage the commerce part by themselves through Stripe, and I'm responsible to keep data like performances of the web store, orders, shipping and so forth. But, this data is now on my systems. Am I a controller for this data too? Should I design the architecture to be customer dependent and offer services explicitly as a processor and provider of services, but delegate data responsibility entirely to my clients? To do this, I guess I should provide them a separated infrastructure that I just 'rent' to them. What if data is on my infrastructure, but I design APIs to allow my clients to edit their 'part of data'?\n\nI know the post is long, and I have MANY MORE questions. One thing sure is I have to get a lawyer ahahah\n\nThanks for the read. Basically, I would like to understand the know-how to be excluded from responsibilities of what my clients post on their website, and be covered in case of illegal activities conducted through my service. \n\nA related scenario is: What prevents Shopify from being guilty of enabling the diffusion of a scam product, or ponzi scheme? What allows social media to be exempt from the guilt of sharing adult content, or violence, or terrorism related content?\n\nI really like this project and in no way I'll ever leave this un-completed. I'm planning to keep it small until it takes off in my local area. I'm not concerned right now of what could happen, since I will meet my clients in person. But I have to be ready to switch to the global scale, where all of a sudden I realized that the true problem is not technical, capital or operational, but it's legal! ",

This makes a tremendous difference with respect to your legal obligations. For example, only data controllers are responsible for handling data subject requests. Data processors have much simpler compliance obligations, but are prohibited from using the data for their own purposes.\n\nMost B2B SaaS will mostly act in a data processor role, though things quickly get complicated when data is shared across customers or if the SaaS provider wants to collect analytics for their own purposes. Here, it doesn't matter what kind of \"architecture\" or \"infrastructure\" you have, but who is *responsible* for the relevant data processing activities.\n\nIn this context, I greatly recommend the in-depth discussion on the concepts of Controller and Processor in the relevant EDPB guidelines (PDF): https://www.edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-072020-concepts-controller-and-processor-gdpr_en",

        "author": "latkde",
        "id": "sg8sll",
        "selftext": "In a [judgement from 2022-01-20 in case 3 O 17493/20](https://rewis.io/urteile/urteil/lhm-20-01-2022-3-o-1749320/), the *Landgericht München* in Germany found that there is no legitimate interest for using Google Fonts. By extensions, this means any use of CDNs is improper.\n\nCore points from the judgement, translated from German:\n\n* The website was ordered to pay a small compensation of EUR 100 to the data subject and to fulfill an Art 15 data subject access request.\n* Embedding fonts from Google Fonts means transmitting the dynamic IP address of the visitor to Google.\n* The dynamic IP address is personal data. The court summarizes the argument from the *Breyer* judgement, that there are reasonable means to identify the data subject with the help of third parties, namely the competent authority and the ISP. “For this it is sufficient that the defendant has the abstract means for identification of the person behind the IP address. Whether the defendant or Google have the concrete means for linking the IP address with the plaintiff is irrelevant.”\n* There was no legal basis for this disclosure. Clearly, there was no consent. There also was no legitimate interest because “Google Fonts can also be used by the defendant without establishing a connection to Google servers when the page loads”. Presumably, the court suggests that the assets can be self-hosted instead.\n* There is a confusing paragraph about “encrypting” the IP address. Presumably, this means that the data subject does not have an obligation to use VPNs. The argument is that compliance obligations cannot be reversed so that the data subject – who should *benefit* from data protection rights – would be responsible for maintaining their privacy.\n* Transmitting this personal data without legal basis violates the affected person's personality rights. This gives rise to a right of compensation per Art 82 GDPR. In calculating the damages, the court took into account that this was regular and not a one-off disclosure, that Google is known for tracking, that transfers to Google's servers in the US do not have an adequate level of data protection, and that the purposes of these damages is also to deter future infringements. In case of repeat infringement, the website was threatened with a fine of “up to” EUR 250000.\n\nDiscussion of consequences and the wider context:\n\n* Schrems II enforcement has arrived in the mainstream. Unnecessary transfers into the US and to US-based companies are now routinely seen as an aggravating factor.\n* This judgement can be seen in a context of closer scrutiny of web privacy / Schrems II issues by courts and supervisory authorities, such as the Austrian DPA's decision that Google Analytics are not OK ([read article by NOYB](https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-dsb-eu-us-data-transfers-google-analytics-illegal)), or another German court's decision about the use of Akamai by Cookiebot ([read article from IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/new-eu-data-blockage-as-german-court-would-ban-many-cookie-management-providers/)).\n* There is no legitimate interest for using CDNs when the assets could be self-hosted instead. Loading content from third parties should generally be made conditional on valid consent. However, this court's argument does not seem applicable when the CDN acts as a data processor. So this clearly affects public/free CDNs for open-source assets like cdnjs, jsdelivr, Google Fonts, BootstrapCDN and the like, but not necessarily commercial/private offerings like Akamai, Cloudfront, Cloudflare, or Fastly. On the other hand, the Cookiebot case mentioned above does single out transfers to Akamai as illegal, though I'm far less convinced that the argument in the Cookiebot case would withstand an appeal.\n* So far, the damages are largely symbolic. The EUR 100 compensation is small compared to the legal costs both parties will have incurred. But this was a single individual, not a group, and compensation for damages suffered, not an administrative fine. The important aspect is not the amount of the fine, but that non-zero damages were assumed for the mere disclosure of an IP address to Google.",

The user had no control over this, it just happened automatically.\n\nSo a website that uses HTML elements like `<link>`, `<script>`, `<img>`, `<iframe>`, `<audio>`, `<video>`, JavaScript APIs like `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch()`, or CSS features like `@import()` to automatically contact US servers would be questionable. Embedding content from third party servers can be a problem.\n\nIn contrast, merely linking to another page (e.g. `<a>` tag) or loading content once the user gives consent would not seem to be a problem.\n\nUsing ordinary links might be a problem though if the browser performs [preloading/prefetching/prerendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_prefetching). These are still somewhat experimental technologies, and generally require that the website explicitly annotates links that should be prefetched.

Previous decisions effectively become a kind of law.\n\nIn a civil law system, laws are given by the legislator. Courts interpret and apply the law and in doing so can disagree with previous rulings in similar matters. In Germany, courts do cite other decisions, but on roughly equal footing with legal literature like commentaries (or EDPB guidelines!). In practice, courts do align with the interpretation suggested by superior courts. In particular, decisions by the European Court of Justice are so important because they make decisions about the correct interpretation of EU law – the ECJ doesn't concern itself too much with the concrete case at hand. Only constitutional courts participate in the development of law, such as by rejecting a law as unconstitutional.\n\nSo the decision in this case does not bind other courts to decide similarly. But the decision has become part of jurisprudence and might be cited in future decisions by other courts. I think it is a very straightforward case that was resolved in a straightforward manner and will be easy to cite by others. It is difficult to disagree with the decision, and the judgment itself calls this a slam-dunk case (though in polite legalese: the lawsuit is “overwhelmingly justified”). On the other hand it does not decide a particularly novel matter so it isn't very relevant – the case received attention primarily because everyone uses Google Fonts, so there is a large *practical* impact. The same decision could have been made back in 2018, based solely on the *Breyer* case where the ECJ decided that dynamic IP addresses are personal data.\n\nThe only potentially interesting aspect of this judgement is the concrete statement about the lack of a legitimate interest. On the other hand, that is a clear consequence of the *necessity test* required for a legitimate interest.\n\nWhen gusmaru asks if this means “that EU Website Operators are unable to reference or link to anything residing in the US”, the technically correct answer is no – the judgement itself has no *legal* effect on courts or data controllers. But the decision reflects an interpretation of the law that seems reasonable. If someone argues a different interpretation, they should use this judgement to update their interpretation even though it is technically still possible to disagree. So this has the *practical* effect of notifying the web developer community that previous assumptions about CDNs do not hold (and weren't correct in Europe since 2018, if not 1995).",

If the IP address is personal data, and the website causes the visitor's browser to connect with a Google service that is not bound by a DPA, then the website is responsible for this sharing of personal data with Google.

In fact, the LG München cited another judgement from the *Breyer* saga.\n\nBut neither the GDPR nor this judgement forbid processing personal data or IP addresses. Here, the court only ruled against sharing personal data to third parties without a good reason. “But it's a CDN” or “pretty fonts” was not considered to be a good reason by the court, as the fonts could have been self-hosted instead. That is not a reality-defying judgement by the court. I started self-hosting fonts when the GDPR came into force, and guess what, it works.\n\n> What is the solution to this, stop loading third-party assets? stop using third-party calls? create a gateway on each website before entering to warn of external technologies that load the page?\n\nThe solution is to stop loading stuff from random third parties without a good reason. There are three possible approaches to resolve this:\n\n* *stop* loading stuff from third parties\n* stop loading stuff from *random third parties* – sign a Data Processing Agreement with them instead so that they are contractually bound to only use the data as instructed by you, but not for their own purposes.\n* have a good reason\n\nWhich of these three approaches is appropriate depends entirely on context.\n\nAs an example, let's consider embedding a YouTube video. You really want to show that video (solution #1 won't work) and YouTube won't sign a DPA for you (solution #2 won't work). This leaves the third approach: have a very good reason.\n\nIn some cases there might be a contractual necessity for sharing data with a third party (for example, connecting with an OAuth server is strictly necessary when the user selected this authentication option). Sometimes there might be a legitimate interest. But consent always works.\n\nThe common solution – widely used here in Germany since about a decade – is to replace the embedded content with a placeholder. The placeholder briefly explains the risks of loading third party content (data like IP addresses is shared with the third party, and what happens with the data is outside your control). The placeholder asks for consent. Clicking on the placeholder loads the actual content. This way, no communication with the third party occurs until the user gives consent. Of course, the consent status can be remembered in a cookie so that the user only has to be asked the first time. The other content in the site remains accessible without consent.\n\n> GDPR also prohibits not displaying or allowing access to people who don't want to share that information\n\nArt 7(4) says that consent will typically not be freely given if performance of a service is made conditional on unrelated consent. Only loading a video when the user consents to personalized ads → unrelated consent and illegal. Only loading a YouTube video when the user consents to loading content from YouTube → that consent is necessary to perform the service and therefore legal.",

If it were not for the website operator's decision to load assets from Google's servers, the users would not have disclosed this personal data to Google.\n\nThe LG München did not invent this responsibility. It was previously established in the *Fashion ID* case.  A company had inserted Facebook Like buttons on the web page, and argued that it was not responsible for the ensuing disclosure of personal data (such as IP addresses or possible tracking cookies) to Facebook. See, it was the browser and not the website operator that disclosed the data, and the website operator never had access to the data in the browser in the first place!\n\nThe European Court of Justice did not buy this argument. By coding the website in a particular way, the website operator was responsible for causing the user's browser to act in a particular way, so it was the “data controller” for the collection an transmission of personal data by the Facebook Like button, though Facebook is of course jointly responsible for what their code does.\n\nThe underlying argument is that someone is a data controller and thus responsible for GDPR compliance when they determine the “purposes and means” of processing, alone or jointly with others. Embedding the code for the button was an exercise of this power to determine purposes and means. In contrast, the website operator is not a data controller for whatever Facebook does with the collected data on its servers, because it cannot control what FB does.\n\nHaving access to the data is not always necessary in order to be the data controller responsible for the processing. This was decided even earlier in the *Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein* case where the creator of a Facebook page was found to be jointly responsible with Facebook for cookie compliance issues. I think that case was also cited in the *Fashion ID* judgement.\n\nThe given case from Munich is a very straightforward extension from the Fashion ID judgement, though the website operator didn't even claim that they weren't responsible.",

The website owner would already have a valid legitimate interest to process IP addresses to deliver the website itself, I guess.\n\nYes. The problem isn't that IP addresses are a thing. That problem is needlessly sharing personal data with a third party which could then use this data for whatever purposes.\n\n> Is there no requirement to demonstrate the *necessity* to engage a data processor to perform a function in the first place?\n\nThe GDPR does not restrict what activities may be outsourced to processors. Anything is fair game. You don't need a legal basis for using a processor – the processor merely acts on behalf of the data controller, and is contractually bound to only use the data as instructed by the controller. So the processor acts as an extension of the controller, not as an independent controller.\n\nThe limitations to this ability to outsource processing activities are (a) that there must be an enforceable contract that binds the processor per Art 28 GDPR, and (b) that the rules on international transfers must of course be followed, if applicable. This latter constraint makes the use of e.g. US or Australian processors quite questionable.\n\n> Would adding [a CDN acting as data processor] to an existing website not be a violation of the \"necessity\" requirement of art(5)(1)(c) -- given that the existing website must have the capability to serve static files, without involving a third party DPA's servers?\n\nI don't think arguing from the Art 5(1)(c) data minimization principle is a good fit here. It says: given an otherwise legal purpose, you can't process more data than necessary for that purpose. But here, we're processing the same amount of data (the IP address + other traffic data), regardless of how we conduct the processing (self-hosted or third party server).\n\nThe “necessity” can be introduced more clearly through Art 6(1). *All* legal bases other than consent require that the processing is necessary. If I were to pick an Art 5 principle to found this on, I'd pick the Art 5(1)(a) lawfulness principle: personal data shall be “processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject”. The data cannot be used for other purposes per the Art 5(1)(b) purpose limitation principle, unless the new purposes are compatible.\n\nOnce a processing activity is legal, the controller can decide freely how to carry out this processing, taking into account the GDPR's principles and conditions. I don't see any terms that would require or prohibit engaging a CDN as a data processor. In practice, this is often just the choice between two data processors anyway: am I engaging a processor to serve assets from a CDN on my behalf, or am I engaging a processor to provide hosting space or a server on my behalf? The GDPR does not require anyone to maintain their own hardware. At most, there might be interesting interactions via Art 32 GDPR (security of processing), which also involves aspects like availability and resilience of the processing systems. I think it is usually easier to argue that a specialized data processor (such as a cloud provider) is better equipped to help me fulfill such security goals than I am on my own.",

                "body": "> This tells me that there must be many scenarios where the means do not reach the threshold of being reasonably likely to be used. GDPR must allow for the outcome of that evaluation to be negative. This makes the case that an IP-address cannot by default be personal data.\n\nI agree that Recital 26 offers the possibility of reaching a conclusion that a given information is not personal data. But it doesn't follow that we should treat IP addresses as anonymous information by default.\n\nLiability argument:\nAn IP address is either anonymous or personal data. There are no further GDPR restrictions on using anonymous data, but there are regulations about using personal data. Thus, the only compliant approach – if we do not specifically know that the IP addresses are anonymous in this context – is to treat them as personal data by default. But sure, this can be disproven.\n\nLikelihood argument:\nThe ECJ gave us the analysis in the *Breyer* case that\n\n> a dynamic IP address registered by an online media services provider when a person accesses a website that the provider makes accessible to the public constitutes personal data within the meaning of that provision, in relation to that provider, where the latter has the legal means which enable it to identify the data subject with additional data which the internet service provider has about that person.\n\nThis is a conditional statement. But then this decision was given back to the lower court, which in this case was the German BGH. The LG München decision about Google Fonts cites this exact BGH decision. The BGH found that German law does afford such legal means which enable the controller to identify the data subject. So at least in the German context in which the LG München works, the ECJ's finding is effectively unconditional. I would expect the same in all other rule-of-law countries as well.\n\nSo, based on the observation that courts have ruled that the controller will typically have the means of identifying the data subject, it is more likely that a user's IP address will be personal data than that it is truly anonymous.\n\nI'm not saying – and hopefully never have said – that all IP addresses are always personal data. It is straightforward to poke holes into the ECJ/BGH decisions for specific scenarios, for example if the user's ISP is not subject to the controller's jurisdiction and out of reach of mutual assistance treaties, or if the ISP (or VPN provider) doesn't keep relevant logs. On the other hand, the ECJ scenario is not the only mechanism through which the data subject behind an IP address might be identified, and you know my “online identifier” argument that strongly suggests IP addresses to be personal data without specific identifiability analysis.\n\nAll of this liability/likelihood discussion doesn't directly address the burden of proof argument I made. I think the best argument that the burden of proof is solely the controller's is the Art 5(2) accountability principle. Though this might be a circular argument: if the data in question is truly anonymous then the GDPR including Art 5(2) doesn't apply…\n\nOf course, in the present case from the LG München, neither the court nor the plaintiff nor the defendant contested that the IP address of the user was personal data.",

Every time that barrier is effective, the \"means\" cannot be said to be reasonably likely to be used. One would have to figure out how often the barrier is effective.\n\n>Thus, the only compliant approach – if we do not specifically know that the IP addresses are anonymous in this context – is to treat them as personal data by default. But sure, this can be disproven.\n\nUnless a particular controller is reasonably likely to randomly file a lawsuit to have a court order an ISP to produce the information, I see no reason why they shouldn't be anonymous by default. That court might also deny such request. Did the controller have the \"legal means\" in that case? A law exists, but it might turn out to not be available to the controller given the arguments made.\n\n>So at least in the German context in which the LG München works, the ECJ's finding is effectively unconditional.

What I think (and no, I don't have any research available right now, but I'm speaking from experience -- do with it what you want) is that you should avoid loading 3rd party services (like Google Fonts, Analytics, advertisements, Font Awesome, jQuery, etc.) from the CDNs these services usually suggest to spare yourself the DNS lookups. \n\nThey offer their files through CDNs for easy implementation, so it's understandable, but it's not for nothing that services like Pingdom and PageSpeed Insights always advise you to reduce/minimize DNS lookups. \n\nThis doesn't mean that CDNs in general are just a hype. No, using a CDN for your own website (meaning all content, instead of just a few JS/CSS files, is served from that CDN) can definitely be beneficial for performance if you want to have international reach. For local businesses I wouldn't suggest using a CDN, though. :-)\n\nI hope that clarifies things!",

Just reassurance they don’t care about our personal journeys \n\nSo fast forward to today it’s been 3 weeks of being tracked and we finally get training on how it all works, who handles our personal data, who the tracker provider can disclose our data to and under what circumstances etc \n\nWe are given a consent form with all the T’s and C’s to sign to say we accept our data is necessary for the purposes stated etc \n\nMy grievance is not with the tracker itself, or the data policy (now that I’ve actually read it) but that I’m effectively being asked to give retrospective consent for personal data collection that started 3 weeks ago, and that I was at the time uninformed about how my data was being handled and processed… other than assurances from management that they weren’t interested in personal journeys \n\nHas my employer breached GDPR here by tracking and collecting my personal data for the last few weeks without prior consent and informing me of the data privacy policy? What are the potential ramifications?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nJust for context I work for a very large U.K. company,",

Seems like the first definitive answer I’ve received!! \n\n> Transparency and the Right to be Informed\n\n>Employers implementing in-vehicle tracking must also comply with their transparency obligations under the GDPR, and ensure they meet the employee’s right to be informed.5\nAn employee must be informed of the existence of tracking and how it operates as well as being clearly informed of all the purposes for which their personal data is to be used, in advance of any such tracking being implemented. This means that the employer must clearly explain to the employee who is using the vehicle concerned what records are being created, why those records are necessary, what they will be used for, how long they will be kept for, who will have access to them and for what reason.\nIt is critical that employees are made fully aware of the extent of the use of the personal data collected through vehicle tracking. Under no circumstances should an employee be left in a situation in which they are unclear on what information is being collected or the purposes of that tracking. The data collected may not be used for any other purpose, unless that processing is compatible with the original purpose of collection.\nAn employee should receive prior notice and clear and comprehensive information about the type and purpose of the tracking. The Article 29 Working Party (WP29)6 recommended that such information should be displayed prominently in every car, within eyesight of the driver.7 While not compulsory, this may be considered good practice for compliance with transparency requirements.\nEmployers should devise and make available to drivers a policy on the use of vehicle tracking. In the context of the use of vehicle tracking devices, this document should also set out the employer's policy on the use of company vehicles for private use, if private use is permissible.\n\nDefinitely seems like they have breached GDPR here, but what are the potential ramifications or consequences of this?\n\nThey have provided me with this information now, but only after 3 weeks of tracking",

As far as what the law is, there are a lot of jurisdictional elements involved, because each jurisdiction is different, and companies have a lot of factors determining what rules apply (i.e. headquarters, where they have customers, where they have employees, citizenship of employees, etc.). It's quite convoluted.\n\nAnd then, after that is all figured out, the issue boils down to whether they have a good reason -- in GDPR parlance, a legitimate reason -- to share the personal data, and then the sharing of the data is measured and balanced against the reason itself.\n\nWhen it comes to birthdays, if someone says \"Bridget is 55 years old today,\" that's going to be the worst type of violation, because it exposes age, and the like. If they say, \"Happy Birthday to Bridget today,\" that's a lot more simple, and the rules aren't quite as violated, or maybe not violated at all. There are some GDPR interpretations that say this could be improper processes of personal data, but again, it will come down to some individual circumstances.\n\nThe best practice for companies is that folks should be given a chance to opt out of these types of announcements and celebrations. HR platforms that show the birthdays to everyone in the company should be able to get toggled off. But, maybe a HR platform shows the birthdays only to managers, and shows birthdays of people in their org. That would be a lot less offensive to personal data processing laws.\n\nSo, again, there is a lot of nuance here.",

Websites could still continue to have the bespoke control options but just not in your face. \n\nThis way I could just say “No” to non-essential cookies once via my browser configuration and not have to navigate cumbersome per-site web configuration which often takes longer to do than actually using the site.",

However, browser makers probably don't have any interest in walking into this legal minefield. Miss any part that is necessary for obtaining valid consent? You get sued/fined from the privacy side. Actually ask for valid consent without using dark patterns? You're sued by the ad network and publisher side for anticompetitive practices. This will be horrible for smaller browser vendors, but absolutely interesting in the case of Google Chrome, a browser built by the world's biggest ad network.\n\nEven if browsers start offering the necessary APIs, will websites use them? Some browsers won't have the consent APIs ready, so websites will still need a fallback. And if you're already implementing a cookie banner, why not use it *all* the time? Websites might also not trust the browser to actually *ask* the user properly, and might fear that the browser just rejects all consent requests.\n\nThere are a couple of existing legal/technical solutions in this direction:\n\n* The [\"do not track\" header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) is a signal browsers can send to websites. It has three possible values opt-in/opt-out/unknown. In 2012, Microsoft Internet Explorer effectively enabled DNT by default, so that the opt-out signal might not have been a decision by the user. Subsequently, DNT became widely ignored. Some browsers have removed DNT support because it is more useful for fingerprinting than for consent management. DNT also cannot indicate valid consent under the GDPR because it is not specific enough.\n* \"Global Privacy Control\" is a mechanism that's very similar to DNT, but can only be used to convey the user's \"Do Not Sell Or Share Preference\". While it has legal effect under the CCPA (California privacy law), it seems unsuitable for GDPR consent management.\n* The IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) is a technical specification that can describe different standardized purposes, and track what the user has consented to (or objected to, in case of legitimate interests). The TCF is the basis for most consent management tools. Because the TCF was created by a consortium of the ad industry, it has seen wide adoption – but also criticism and lawsuits that caused significant refinements. But the current status quo involves an industry of cookie management solutions that package the TCF into easy to use plugins for websites, and I don't think they'd be particularly happy if their entire business would be taken over by browsers.\n* Specifically for cookie consent in Germany, § 26 TTDSG explicitly paves a path towards centralized consent management. But I don't expect it to see wide adoption, due to the fairly strict criteria needed for such a centralized system, and because any centralized solution will likely result in less consent – going against the interests of the ad industry and websites.\n\nPersonally, I'm fairly happy that the EU has not legislated a specific technical approach that everyone must use, and instead only provided conditions that valid consent must fulfil. It could be much, much worse. But for the time being, this means we're locked into a world where every website has its own slightly different consent banner.\n\nFor technical people on desktop systems, I recommend using a tracking blocker like uBlock Origin and subscribing to filter lists that remove \"annoyances\", for example the \"AdGuard Annoyances\" lists. This hides many cookie banners, but sometimes breaks some sites.",

It’s a good rule in principle - you should be in control of what information is put onto or taken off your device - but it’s out of date and ultimately a blunt tool for a more nuanced issue given the way the internet works. The connection to GDPR is that it takes its definition of consent from GDPR, which is now stricter (or more accurately, clearer) than the previous data protection directive.\n\nA new ePrivacy Directive was supposed to come in alongside GDPR, with a more modern approach to cookies, but the EU hasn’t been able to agree it so we currently have this slight fudge of the GDPR alongside the older ePrivacy directive that’s lead to the situation we have now.\n\nIn answer to your question of whether browser based consent has been considered, the answer is yes, sort of, in the UK at least - the previous government had already started to try and make changes to the cookie rules with this being one of the ultimate aims (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/data-a-new-direction) but the legislation didn’t get through before the recent election so it remains to be seen what the new government’s plans are.\n\nIn the meantime the UK ICO has made it clear that for a cookie banner to be compliant, if there is an “Accept All” button then there also has to be a “Reject All” button in the same layer (i.e. it must be as easy to reject all cookies as to accept them all) which is something at least.",

Seems like a learner has bypassed their  educational organisation and came straight to us. The learner doesn’t have an account with us or anything.\n\nThis has led me to a couple of questions:\n\n1. Given the required retention periods in the education sector, how should we handle requests for data deletion before the end of this period?\n\n2. We would regard ourselves as data processors so   should we inform the organisation admin?\n\n3. The description of data controllers are a little vague. I’m unsure if we’re also data controllers.

This medical software company appears to be a third-party, although I'm not sure if something like my non-citizen status or the clinic's existing agreement with me would effect the meaning of that.\n\nI also didn't know this change in the clinic's services was made until I requested an appointment by email, and the confirmation arrived in the new form of this company's services.\n\nThe only information I was given about this change prior to its implementation, was a verbal indication during one therapy session immediately prior, that the office's in-house secretary would be handling the scheduling of future appointments. There was no mention of any new medical software company having access to my data.\n\nI was never asked to renew a consent form. I wasn't given any opportunity to opt-out of having personal details like my full name and email shared with this company.\n\nAlthough my name and email address were evidently shared, the clinic has kindly agreed to \"erase\" all my data from the company's software and allow me to opt-out of its services in the future.\n\nQuestions:\n\nWas there a breach of my medical data?\n\nShould the clinic have notified me in writing or obtained my written consent prior to introducing my data to the medical software company's webapp?\n\nIf not, why?",

        "selftext": "I have a few questions about how to implement a cookie consent banner according to GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive.\n\nI have a Wordpress website with Vimeo videos. Because Wordpress has Guestmode enabled, it sets the cookie _lscache_vary, which records whether a visitor is logged in, and if not, it serves them a cached page.\n\nIs this a \"strictly necessary cookie\"? Probably not, as I can disable Guestmode, with the only difference being that the site gets slower because I can't use cached pages. As far as I can see, that means that **I am not allowed to cache pages until I've asked for consent**, which means that I'll have to use slow, non-cached pages for every new visitor. Have I understood that correctly?\n\nThen Vimeo sets the Cloudflare Bot Management cookie __cf_bm, which records whether the user is a human or a bot. This one... **might** be strictly necessary? I don't think there's anything I can do to stop the cookie from being written if I want Vimeo to work, in any case.\n\nSome other Vimeo and Wordpress cookies are set if the visitor logs in (a test cookie, and one that stores account details) or plays a video (preferences and Vimeo usage history cookies). I'm guessing these might all count as \"strictly necessary\" for their respective uses?\n\nSo what if the user clicks \"reject all\" on the cookie banner? What do I do then? Nothing at all, because all the remaning cookies are strictly necessary? Or does that mean that I can skip the banner entirely?\n\nAlternatively, if the Vimeo usage history cookie doesn't count as \"strictly necessary\", do I have to record their answer and block them from watching videos? Or try to figure out some way to stop Vimeo from storing usage history?\n\nI'm confused.",

This actually sounds like something optional — but hey again, maybe Vimeo experience is quite fundamental to what you do, and you would believe people would be it justified?\nShort: would suggest functional, or extra evaluation\n\n\nTake care",

                "body": "On one hand, that \"strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user\" criterion must be interpreted narrowly. In particular, necessity must be viewed from the user's perspective. For example, advertising-related cookies might be necessary for a website's business model, but they are not necessary to show that page right now.\n\nOn the other hand, this provision is commonly interpreted a bit more widely. In particular, security measures cannot be optional, they are strictly necessary for the service as a whole to work. Similarly, some degree of caching is probably necessary, and sometimes cookies are needed for that.\n\nInstead of thinking about this as a choice between \"allow all\" and \"reject all\", a more compliant viewpoint would be the three choices \"allow all\", \"customize\", and \"necessary only\".\n\nWhen embedding third party content on your pages, cookies are only part of the issue. The mere act of causing the browser to load that third-party content discloses personal data to that third party, and thus requires a legal basis. Common solutions are:\n\n* The third party is contractually bound to perform some service on your behalf, and will not use your user's data for other purposes.\n* Embedding the content is necessary, e.g. to fulfil your contract with the user or to meet a legitimate interest (this is similar to but weaker than the \"strictly necessary\" standard for cookies).\n* The user gave their consent.\n\nIn many cases, consent is the appropriate choice. This doesn't have to be part of your consent banners that primarily discuss cookies, though it can be. In case no consent has been given (yet), the embedded content might be replaced by a placeholder that asks for consent. Once consent is given, the placeholder is replaced by the actual content. I commonly see this for embedded Youtube videos, social media posts, or maps. This is a great way to ask for consent because the benefit is obvious to the user, and you can use the consent request to explain potential problems (e.g. cookies that the embed provider will set).\n\nVimeo is interesting because it might act either as a video content delivery network that is your data processor, or like a video sharing platform where embedding would likely require consent.\n\nLoading Stripe is probably necessary for the purpose of entering into a contract, but only on your checkout pages – not on other pages.",

I don't really have a say in how Vimeo and Stripe are integrated into my page – for these kinds of services, you typically include some existing Javascript code that is provided to you. \n\nFor example, allowing the users to pay without fraud prevention (as provided by the cookie) sounds insane. And I'm not sure I'd even be able to rewrite Vimeo's scripts to show videos without saving preferences as cookies, or rewrite Stripe's scripts so that users can go to payment-related pages without the fraud prevention cookie being added. **So would I be obliged to block large parts of the site for users who reject all cookies?**\n\nI'm also still confused about the \"strictly necessary\" concept. If a site contains different pages, some with only text, others with videos, and a cookie is strictly necessary for showing videos but not for displaying text, then would the video cookie actually be \"strictly necessary\"?

In that case you need to write a balancing test. Something like why this stuff is good for your company and why is it bad for the customer, why are your companies rights better and how you minimize the damage the data processing causes. It is not that hard, but you need to find a few examples first to know how it should look like. Another ground that you have a contract with the customer and that fraud prevention cookie is required to fulfill the contract. In the case of webshops I think this latter is a lot more common because you have a contract before payment.",

Information from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time -- we don't store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.\n\n### Information Collected from Other Sources\n\nSmall changes in phrasing how data sources are combined. Now directly explains how to configure this:\n\n> You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by visiting the Safety & Privacy section of the User Settings menu in your account, as described in the section titled \"Your Rights and Choices\" below.\n\n### Audience measurement\n\nRemoved explicit names of companies, and now characterizes them as “service providers”:\n\n> We partner with ~~audience measurement companies (including Quantcast and Nielsen)~~ **service providers that perform audience measurement** to learn demographic information about the population that uses Reddit.\n\n## How we use this information\n\nThe items were re-ordered. Two items were changed, separating ad-related purposes from normal processing:\n\nOld:\n\n> Measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services; and\n>\n> Personalize the Services, and provide and optimize advertisements, content, and features that match user profiles or interests.\n\nNew:\n\n> Personalize services, content, and features that match your activities, preferences, and settings. […]\n>\n> Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services;\n\n## Your Rights and Choices\n\nThis merges the previous sections “Your Choices” and “Your Rights”.\n\nThe preamble now mentions that Reddit distinguishes rights based on user location, and no longer mentions that an account may be a prerequisite for exercising these choices.\n\nOld:\n\n> You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Some of these choices are available to everyone who uses Reddit, while others only apply if you have a Reddit account.\n\nNew:\n\n> You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Depending on where you live, you may also have the right to request access to or ability to port, deletion/erasure of, or correction/rectification of, your personal information, to opt out of certain advertising practices, or to withdraw consent for processing where you have previously provided consent. Below we explain how to exercise each of these rights. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws.\n\n### Accessing and Changing Your Information\n\nsmall change in phrasing.\n\n> You can access **your information** and change **or correct** certain information through the Services.\n\n### Deleting Your Account\n\nNew version mentions how long deletion takes:\n\n> After you submit a request to delete your account, it may take up to 90 days for our purge script to complete deletion.\n\n### Opt Out of Targeted Advertising\n\nThis new section was moved out of “Controlling Advertising and Analytics”.\nThe new version no longer defers to privacy settings of mobile operating systems.\n\nOld:\n\n> We also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences your account settings in the Reddit app, or here if you use Reddit in a web browser. You can also use device-level settings to control personalized advertisements on Android (\"Reset advertising ID\" and \"Opt out of Ads Personalization\") and iOS (\"Limit Ad Tracking\") devices.\n\nNew:\n\n> You may opt out of us using information we collect from third parties, including advertising partners, to personalize the ads you see on Reddit. To do so, visit the Safety & Privacy section of the User Settings in your account here, if using desktop, and in your Account Settings if using the Reddit mobile app.\n\n### Controlling Location Information\n\nIn line to the changes with how location data is collected,\nthe following sentence was removed:\n\n> If you initially consent to our collection of more precise location information from your device, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.\n\n### Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests\n\nThis section no longer has a heading.\nRequests are no longer scoped to just GDPR and CCPA.\nMention of requests via authorized agents are moved to the CCPA section.\n\n> ~~Requests for a copy of the information Reddit has about your account--including EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") data subject access requests and California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") consumer information requests--can be submitted following the process described here.~~\n>\n> ~~All other data subject and consumer requests under data protection laws should be sent via email to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your Reddit account. Other inquiries related to your privacy rights can be submitted here.~~\n>\n> **If you have questions or are not able to submit a request to exercise your rights using the mechanisms above, you may also email us at to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your Reddit account, or submit them here.**\n>\n> Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified email address associated with your Reddit account.\n> **If we deny your request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us at redditdatarequests@reddit.com.**\n> ~~You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information.~~\n\n### International Data Transfers\n\nThe section was moved until after the EEA Users section.\n\nDrops the explicit mention of “Reddit, Inc.” as the target of data transfers.\n\nRemoves Privacy Shield explanation.\n\n### Additional Information for California Users\n\nChanged introduction paragraph slightly, but not materially.\n\nUpdates the referenced law:\n\n> The California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), **as amended,**\n\nAdds a category of data collected:\n\n> Your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail).\n\nUpdates the description of CCPA data subject rights. Moves and expands the explanation of requests via authorized agents.\nI won't show the full changes here.\n\nInteresting addition: Reddit now explicitly says it doesn't sell data:\n\n> Reddit does not \"sell\" or \"share\" personal information as those terms are defined under the CCPA. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information except to provide you the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA.\n\n### Children\n\nChanges the definition of children to work outside of Europe:\n\n> Additionally, if you are ~~in the EEA,~~ **located outside the United States,** […]\n\n### Changes to This Policy\n\nRemoved unrealistic requirement on users:\n\n> We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy\n> ~~whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us~~\n> **regularly** […]\n\n### Contact Us\n\nAdded an electronic contact method.\n\nReddit changed its Irish address.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been working for an EU-based digital startup for about a year. We’ve built a global data architecture as we plan to launch our app in the US market as well as in the EEA (EU). Our goal is to gain deep insights into in-app user behavior to create segments of successful and unsuccessful users. Along the way, we collect a substantial amount of sensitive data (medical insights, emails, names, etc.). \n\nTo comply with GDPR, we funnel our user input into two separate operational databases located in the US and EU to meet data residency requirements. However, we recently realized that the event data we collect via our Firebase SDK integration with Google Analytics 4 also contains a lot of sensitive information. To obtain granular data without relying on the GA4 interface, we used the BigQuery link to export all of our custom events and attributes to Google BigQuery. From there, we use Fivetran to transfer the data into our EU-hosted Snowflake data warehouse to combine it with our operational databases.\n\nWe’ve been consulting with our designated DPO, but no one seems to have a fitting answer to the question: “What are the alternatives to our GA4 setup that allow us to record sensitive event data to monitor our developments?”\n\nAccording to our research, GA4 temporarily stores user data collected in the EU but then sends it to the US for processing. This would violate GDPR if we track medical records (weight, BMI, emails) via GA4.\n\nWe are aware that we could implement SCCs, Impact Assessments, TIAs, etc., to make these data transfers valid. However, our management would prefer a solution that allows us to store and process all data in the EU to minimize risks.\n\nWe have identified two alternative solutions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Replace GA4 with Firebase SDK + Firebase DB to store our event data. Then export the data from Firebase BigQuery into BigQuery and from there into Snowflake. Additionally, we are considering using UXCam to track user journeys throughout the app.\n\n2. Replace our GA4 setup and connect our SDK to Amplitude. Export our event data from Amplitude to Snowflake via Fivetran.\n\nThe questions I have are:\n\na) If we go the Firebase route, does Google still process our data in the US? The Firebase interface offers dashboards, which I assume are powered by our event data. Does the processing happen in the EU or the US?\n\nb) Has anyone used UXCam and can provide insights on its performance and areas where it does (or doesn’t) perform well?\n\nc) Is Amplitude a decent replacement for our setup? I am still looking for strong arguments to pitch to our product manager on why we should use tools like Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Heap instead of web-based analytics such as GA4/Firebase in combination with UXCam.\n\nAs you can tell, GDPR has been a significant challenge for our analytics as a startup with global aspirations. We collect and store a lot of sensitive data and, therefore, have to be very careful with our setup and how we transfer and analyze data across borders (or not).\n\nLastly, a slightly off-topic question: If we have an employee in the US logging into our Snowflake Data platform hosted in the EU to run queries and perform basic analytics, would this be considered a data transfer since the query results are a processing activity? Would GDPR flag this as a violation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know these are a lot of questions, but data privacy is highly complex and there isn’t much information about past use cases that fit our current operations. I've been specializing on Data Analytics and Science but app development has been a steep learning curve for me.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this. I look forward to a constructive discussion and hopefully some insights that will help us move in the right direction.\n\nCheers!\n\n&#x200B;",

                "body": ">  two separate operational databases located in the US and EU to meet data residency requirements\n\nThe EU/UK GDPR does not impose data residency requirements in the traditional sense. International transfers need safeguards, e.g. SCCs or an adequacy decision. US companies can self-certify under the *Data Privacy Framework* adequacy decision. Before that EU–US data transfers were quite shaky in the wake of the Schrems II decision, but for now there is a clear path for data transfers.\n\n> Along the way, we collect a substantial amount of sensitive data (medical insights, emails, names, etc.). \n\nA couple of pointers:\n\n* The EU GDPR declares \"special categories of data\" such as health information, processing of which is only legal under certain circumstances, such as *explicit consent*. This will also affect your risk assessments. But if processing this data is lawful, then data transfers can be OK as well.\n\n* Some services (such as Google Analytics) have a definition of PII/personal data that is different from the GDPR definition. However, GA forbids you from uploading data that they consider personal.\n\n* Depending on whether you create per-user profiles (even if pseudonymous) and what you do with that info, you may run into issues around the GDPR's limitations on profiling. This becomes especially problematic when you offer personalized offers or discounts. Some of that can be legal, but it gets increasingly complicated.\n\n> GDPR has been a significant challenge for our analytics as a startup with global aspirations.\n\nGDPR compliance in an international company can be really complicated. But here the main issue doesn't seem to be data transfer issues, but a culture that is not grounded in the GDPR's data minimization principle (Art 5(1)(c) / Art 25).\n\n> If we have an employee in the US logging into our Snowflake Data platform hosted in the EU to run queries and perform basic analytics, would this be considered a data transfer\n\nFor GDPR purposes, it doesn't matter where data is stored. It matters more where data is processed, in particular from where that processing is controlled. That can also happen via remote access.\n\nBut due to a technicality, it could be that no data transfer has taken place in that example: as commonly understood, a data transfer needs an *exporter* who is already subject to the GDPR, and a non-EU-based *importer* (e.g. compare EDPB guidelines 05/2021). If these are the same entity, no transfer would have taken place. The individual employee is not an importer because they just act on behalf of their company. However, a data transfer may have taken place if data is shared across different companies (possibly as part of the same undertaking).\n\nIn contrast, use of a cloud service such as GA or Firebase would very likely involve a data transfer. If your contract is with one of the US-based Google entities, then we have an exporter (your startup, regardless where it's based) and importer (Google, even when acting as a data processor on your behalf). If your contract is with the EU-based Google Ireland, you might not be the exporter yourself (that would happen between different Google companies), but there would still be an international data transfer under your responsibility.",

While your data resides in the chosen region, metadata or control data may be managed outside it.\n\n>**Support and Maintenance**: For operational purposes such as troubleshooting, support, and maintenance, some data might be accessed by personnel in different regions, potentially including the US.\n\n>**Inter-Region Replication**: For redundancy and disaster recovery, GCP might replicate data across regions, which could include regions in the US, depending on your configurations and services used.\n\n>**Global Services**: Some GCP services are global by nature (e.g., IAM, Cloud Storage with multi-region   \nbuckets), meaning data might be distributed or accessed across multiple regions, including the US.\n\nAs Google is part of the EU-US Data Protection Framework (DPF), these transfers would legally be considered flowing to an \"Adequate\" country while the DPF is considered valid.\n\nAs for the employee who is viewing the data from the US, this would be considered a data transfer under the GDPR as it considers viewing the information from a 3rd country a transfer.

But as you suggest, if you’ve updated the agency in the past, and they’ve not updated your details, then that is a breach in itself, and the subsequent sharing is also likely a breach",

We have just over 50 contacts and each one has sent us an email asking to be added to our mailing list - we send two emails a month, meeting reminders and meeting follow-ups with links to resources we've discussed (nothing personal).\n\nUsing the gmail.com email address, BCCing 50+ recipients, including many links etc has led to a few users reporting our emails have landed in their spam/junk folder. So, I'm looking at obtaining an email address from the charity (it'll be .org.uk) and moving the mass email to a service like MailChimp.\n\nMy question: if changing from the gmail.com email address to the .org.uk email address, do we need the existing 50+ members to give their consent again with regards to receiving emails from us?\n\nOr can we simply migrate our contacts to the new platform and tell them about the new email address for future correspondence?",

For the past 4 years, I've been working in the IT industry, primarily in data analytics. During this time, I've developed a strong foundation in business intelligence and worked with tools like Power BI and MicroStrategy. I also have intermediate-level skills in SQL.\n\nRecently, my career took an unexpected turn. Over the past three months, I've had the opportunity to dive into the world of data privacy. I've been working extensively with a tool called OneTrust, and I've completed several certifications in this area. Surprisingly, I've developed a newfound interest in data privacy, and I'm thinking of making a career switch.\n\nThe catch is, my experience with data privacy is primarily on the technical side – things like setting up web forms for data subject access requests and managing consent and preferences. While I have some high-level knowledge and have read a few articles on GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD, I'm eager to delve deeper into this field.\n\nSo, I turn to you, fellow Redditors, for guidance:\n\nHow can I successfully transition from data analytics to data privacy?\n\nWhat certifications should I pursue to bolster my knowledge and expertise in data privacy?\n\nMy passion lies in the technical implementation side of data privacy; how can I specialize in this aspect?\n\nI'm excited to hear your insights and experiences. Your advice will be invaluable as I embark on this journey to pivot my career towards data privacy. Thank you in advance!",

I suppose you also need to be aware that the initial email may concern and identify a single child.

On the plus side, presumably none of the parents have complained? That being the case, you're probably safe from any repercussions for now.\n\nIf parents choose to send emails to the school and all other parents, that's their prerogative - there's nothing you can do to stop this now that the damage has been done. You probably shouldn't \"Reply All\" to these emails, particularly if your reply includes personal data about parents or children, but even if it doesn't, it's just going to be a nightmare from a customer service perspective.\n\nYou can probably *ask* parents not to copy everyone into their emails, especially if this always results in a clusterfuck of crossed wires and difficult situations, and you can make it clear that you won't be Replying All any more and if they have any issues they want to raise, they should contact you directly. If at any point you do need to send all parents an email about an issue that has been raised, just send this as a new communication. \n\nThere might be some teething problems with all of the above as some parents are probably happy with the current system (especially if those parents are persistent troublemakers), but if you stick to a suitable process no matter what, they will start to realise this is how it is.\n\nIn future, if parents want to get in touch with other parents, they can get the contact details the same way school parents always have done - by asking them in person.",

Nonetheless, people should be aware that more and more often, the Supervisory Authorities are shooting down the exception in cases that you might think are personal. E.g., recently, the Spanish SA held that a guy that forwarded private photos of another girl through social media exceeded the \"purely personal\" exception because of the aim to \"share with the world\". Everyone should watch out for what they do in this sense, especially with WhatsApp&Facebook groups, websites, etc.\n\nRegarding the responsibility of the daycare for the parents' emails, another two things to take into account:\n\n* The reason why they have each other's emails in the first place is because of a former bad practice of the daycare. This matters.\n* The daycare could be seen as an organiser of the communications/the reason why they are communicating in the first place, so it does have a duty to \"regulate\" or moderate. \n* You are not only allowed to but should remind parents of the duty to protect their and others' intimacy. Of course, I wouldn't be too technical nor refer to the GDPR, but remind them that what is written in an email can be seen by others and that they should direct emails only to the people that need to know about the content (especially when the topic is sensitive), that they should use BCC when appropriate, etc.\n\nCreating a document of good practices and sharing it with them could be a strong argument to protect the daycare if, in the future some parent messes up.",

In the past, I've sometimes allowed anyone to sign up if they can actually find the site. These apps accept as little data as possible (sometimes not even a signup email), and they do no processing beyond what the user specifically requested. No money, advertising or analytics are involved.\n\nHowever, one catch is that I'm not promising to answer _anyone's_ emails within 30 days. Now, no GDPR authority is ever going to care about an obscure hobby site on another continent, and I'm not targetting anyone in Europe. So it's unlikely that the GDPR even applies.\n\nBut let's say I wanted to make honest effort. And let's say I wanted to handle as much as possible via self service. One authority summarizes the major GDPR rights as:\n\n- Right of access: Find out what data is being used.\n- Right to rectification: Fix inaccurate or incomplete personal data. \n- Right to erasure: Ask to have data deleted.\n- Rght to restrict processing: Mostly this seems to act sort of like a litigation hold. Keep the data, but don't use it.\n- Right to data portability: Export your data in some convenient format.

Most hobby sites aren't affected.\n\nSo for a simple app that tries to avoid PII, how many of these could be handled via self-service? Some rights seem easier than others:\n\n- Access, rectification and erasure could mostly be done using the ordinary app UI, as long as all data was visible to the user and editable.\n- Data portability could probably be accomplished via JSON export.\n- \"Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing\" often won't apply to low-stakes hobby sites.\n\nSome others seem a bit more complicated:\n\n- Restricting processing is weird. In some cases, I think you'd need to freeze the account, or make the raw data readable by only the user?\n- Can the right to object be satisfied by some combination of outright deletion and restricting processing?\n\nWhat major concerns am I overlooking here? What portion of total GDPR compliance could be designed into the fundamental structure of a hobby site? Think of this as an exercise in extreme \"privacy by design.\"",

                "body": "It seems you have a good overview and a plan to tackle the main data subject rights. Great! This is, after all, one of the more visible parts of the GDPR.\n\nHowever, GDPR is deeper than providing a data access feature. Before you tackle those, it makes sense to look at [Art 5 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) – the principles from which the rest follows. Every processing of personal data should have a clear purpose and \"legal basis\", and should be limited to what is necessary. The data should be protected with appropriate security measures.\n\nThat legal basis bit is important because it interacts with data subject rights. For example, \"consent\" gives the data subject an unconditional right to revoke consent. A \"legitimate interest\" gives rise to the right to object – but that objection can sometimes be denied. This in turn means that not all deletion requests have to be honored. For example, you wouldn't let a hacker object to logfiles that document their exploit attempts.\n\nSo much here is contextual, I don't think it's possible to be entirely compliant with an automated approach. But it's possible to get pretty far. You can implement an \"export my data\" and \"delete my account\" feature, which gets you mostly there. You can gate some features behind an opt-in for consent, or opt-out/objection for legitimate interests (where appropriate).\n\nYou missed one important data subject right: the right to be informed. The necessary items are listed in Art 13 GDPR. If you receive personal data from third parties, Art 14 is relevant as well. Most privacy notices include the general information from the Art 15 right to access as well.\n\nIt might be worth considering implementing privacy-friendly systems, but without referencing the GDPR. This is because such claims might suggest that you're actively targeting people in the EU/EEA/UK, subverting this line of argument:\n\n> I'm not targetting anyone in Europe. So it's unlikely that the GDPR even applies.",

The flash card data is strictly necessary for the tasks requested by the user, and the data is effectively under their control.\n\n> This in turn means that not all deletion requests have to be honored. For example, you wouldn't let a hacker object to logfiles that document their exploit attempts.\n\nHonestly, a better strategy for log data is probably to throw it all out after 7-15 days anyways. Long-term log data creates other risks. The exception, of course, is to comply with a legal hold, subpoena or warrant. At which case local law is far more relevant than extraterritorial EU laws!\n\n> You missed one important data subject right: the right to be informed. \n\nReading through section 13, I think the most important part in this scenario would be a clear, written policy explaining what data is stored, how it is used, and how to view/edit/export/delete it. The more specific details for GDPR compliance (like various officers and agents) might be less relevant for small sites that do not target EU users, or collect sensitive information about them.",

It sounds like only you or your organization will get the results, so that alone takes it out of consideration. To meet this requirement, the data subject must have *themselves* made something so accessible to the public that there is no question it would be publicly available to *everyone,* not just that it could theoretically be publicly available. Think tweets and social media posts *only* if the user has totally public settings. \n\nWhile consent *can be* a hard legal basis to rely on, it’s actually very doable for surveys since you have a chokepoint at the entry.  Get consent at the outset where you have plenty of space to clearly lay out the necessary elements of consent and can record the click of the user’s agreement. You can even take steps to limit the reidentifiability of results if your data systems have a basic level of GDPR compliance built in. For example, you can create a mapping table of user/random identifier, then a secondary table of random identifier/consent-id, and then delete the first table with user information.",

But that is not an impossible standard. For example, you could include a checkbox that subjects can tick to indicate consent, after being suitably informed about what data you're going to collect. Also, make sure to make it very clear that these fields can be left empty, and remind the subjects that the questionnaire can be cancelled at any time.\n\nAs already pointed out, responses in a survey are not “public”, so that exemption cannot apply. The “manifestly made public by the data subject” requires that the data subject disclosed the special categories of data themselves, and into the public sphere. For example, if a celebrity discloses in a TV show that they are gay, you'd no longer be prohibited by Art 9(1) from storing that information (assuming that you also have a suitable Art 6(1) legal basis).",

                "body": "Good one. So let me get this straight. Your employer uses a digital platform for time keeping purposes (which should be the employer's legal obligation as to the end). The employer also wants to register the geo-location of the employees and you say it is not clear why the employer does this.\n\nLet me start by saying that consent should be out of the question as a lawful basis b/c free nature of consent is typically flawed in employment relationships - there's DPA practice on this and it is confirmed by courts. So if the employer actually asks you to consent, you should be able to refuse to provide it and it should be fine, i.e., no retaliation against you, no collection of geo-location data (or if collected that data should not be used), etc.\n\nThen, you can find out why the employer uses this data (i.e., the processing purpose) by filing a data access request grounded on art. 15, GDPR (or any equivalent); you should also ask the employer to clarify the lawful basis to this end (although the employer is not mandated under the GDPR to provide this info). You may find out that the employer uses the geo-location data to substantiate Labour Law, HSSE obligations related to remote work (i.e., l.b. = employer's legal obligation) or for security purposes (i.e., l.b. = employer's legitimate interest, possibly in the context of a legal obligation, such as those under the NIS legislation, or as part of a security certification required in the employer's business); other purposes may apply (seen a few in practice), but I'd be very curious to learn about them :). If the lawful basis is the legal obligation, there's not much you can do about it and you face a Sartrian existential dilemma where you must decide between keeping and quitting your job. If it's legitimate interest, you can theoretically object to the processing, but you must raise your own personal reasons for this and anyway the employer may provide you with their overarching reasons to proceed with the processing (art. 21, GDPR).\n\nIf you are not satisfied with your employer's reaction and response, you can always complain to the DPA. You should invoke, for instance, that the processing is unlawful, or excessive, or that it hurts your interests and freedoms, and you should describe why. This is somehow the equivalent of blowing the whistle on your employer, so you could expect retaliation (which should not be legal where you live, but this is the life).\n\nYou probably have other courses of action as well, such as challenging the validity of the legal provision, etc., but these are not so commonly pursued.",

Per Art 88 GDPR, data processing in the context of employment can be governed by more specific national laws or by collective agreements. For example, if your workplace is unionized and the employer negotiated a collective agreement with the council/union, then the agreement could authorize such location tracking.\n\nIf that doesn't apply, we return to the usual GDPR rules: any processing of personal data must have a clear purpose, and must be authorized by a “legal basis”. That basis could be consent, but doesn't have to be. Relevant alternative legal bases:\n\n* knowing your location is necessary for fulfilling the employment contract\n* there is a legal requirement to record your location\n* geolocating you is necessary for a legitimate interest that outweighs your interests and rights\n\nOnly in the case of a legitimate interest would you be able to object to such tracking, but the objection could be overridden if the legitimate interests are compelling enough.\n\nA lot here will depend on context, e.g. whether the employee works in a fixed office, or whether the employee spends most of their time traveling internationally. I could see potential legitimate interests from a tax compliance, insurance, or worker safety angle. The granularity of the location could also matter, e.g. country-level vs GPS location accurate to a few meters.\n\nIn general I agree with you that such location tracking is creepy and probably unnecessary, but there's way too little info to know. I agree with other commenters that a first step to get more info would be a data subject access request (DSAR) to the employer about the exact data collected by the time-stamping platform.\n\n* Per Art 13(1)(c) and (d) you should have already been informed about the purposes of processing, the legal bases, and the legitimate interests (if any).\n* Per Art 15(1)(a) and (b) the response to the DSAR should describe the purposes of processing, and the categories of data being processed.",

This decision is based on the following :\n\n*Under Article 17 of the GDPR individuals have the right to have personal data erased. This is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. The right is not absolute, the right applies if the data is no longer needed for the purpose it was collected or if the basis for collect and processing was the consent of the patient.  Medical data is always needed to satisfy any future issues about health and you are not processing the data with consent you are processing under Article 9(2)(h) for medical purposes and Article 6(1)(e) under a legal obligation to process the data (NHS contract being the legal obligation) as such this right does not apply, and you cannot comply with the request.*\n\nThis is guidance from the ICO:\n\n*When does the right to erasure not apply?*\n\n*The right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for one of the following reasons:*\n\n*•  to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;*\n\n*•  to comply with a legal obligation;*\n\n*• for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority;*\n\n*•  for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research historical research or statistical purposes where erasure is likely to render  impossible or seriously impair the achievement of that processing; or*\n\n*•  for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.*\n\n*The GDPR also specifies two circumstances where the right to erasure will not apply to special category (medical) data:*\n\n*•  if the processing is necessary for public health purposes in the public interest (e.g. protecting against serious cross-border threats to health, or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices);*     \n\n*Or*\n\n*•  if the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine (e.g. where the processing is necessary for the working capacity of an employee; for medical diagnosis; for the provision of health or social care; or for the management of health or social care systems or services). This only applies where the data is being processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to a legal obligation of  professional secrecy (e.g. a health professional).*\n\n*Article 16 of the GDPR states: - The data subject (patient) shall have the right to obtain from the controller (practice)  without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data  concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.*\n\nI will include a statement on your medical record to state that you have requested your medical record to be removed and include the decision and reasoning behind this.\n\nYou do have the right to contact the ICO.\n\nI am on annual leave until mid August.\n\nYours sincerely",

Specifically for the GDPR, there seems to be no lawful basis (Art 6(1)) for this processing, facial recognition implies processing of biometric data which is generally prohibited (Art 9) and the information requirements to data subjects have probably not been met (Art 14).\n\nData processing by police is out of scope for the GDPR, and instead covered by the closely related directive 2016/680, which I have no experience with. There will also be national laws setting rules for police work, importantly an EU member state could pass laws that allows this kind of processing. However, police forces don't always stick to technologies that are explicitly allowed. Data protection agencies also have the difficulty that one branch of the government enforcing against the other is a bit pointless, since fines are only a weak deterrent. Thus, it wouldn't be entirely surprising if there are EU police agencies that are trialling Clearview software.",

It is also necessary to make it possible to decline consent, without detriments to the data subject. Making content inaccessible without consent would likely be noncompliant. Consent also has to be informed and specific – you have to give enough information about the cookies used that they can make an informed decision, and they should be able to consent to one purpose but not another (e.g. analytics yes but marketing no).\n\nTo some degree, this is the fault of the EU. The requirement to ask for consent for all cookies is excessive. The ePrivacy Directive which introduced the cookie consent requirement was supposed to be updated together with the GDPR, but since about three years there hasn't been any progress.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you will have to use a cookie consent banner. But since a compliant banner will make it easy to decline consent, you will get somewhat useless data. A possible alternative is to use analytics without cookies/LocalStorage, so that no consent is required. But that means you can't track sessions across pages.",

I was going through various GDPR related sites (including those that create Privacy Policies) but got a little confused as I was trying them out.  \n\n\nMy app needs email address, name of the person and company they are working with to allow signups and logins. It is a performance management system, so, once signed up/logged in, the client company using our platform may request additional information (or may import it from their existing systems) like age, phone numbers, etc. Not to mention all performance related data that will be created/generated/manipulated over the period of use.  \n\n\nWe (as the product owners/developers) will use all this information only to generate reports for HR, managers or for users themselves and not use them outside (for marketing, mailers, etc.). Any mails, messages that are sent will be sent through the system and by system users and not by us (the developing company). This includes any data manipulation as well.   \n\n\nIn other words, all the personal information is firewalled within the customer's company account and not available outside its boundaries.   \n\n\nSo, do we in our privacy policy state that we collect \"all\" the information of an employee or just that which is required to allow sign up/login?  \n\n\nThanks again.

You will also want to have someone specify your legal hold procedures, because this information will 100% be part of lawsuits.\n\nYou will need a DPA (data processing agreement) specifying that you are a processor, not a controller; and that you obey the GDPR generally.  Plus your procedures to do so.  Note that, as a processor, you cannot share or delete employee information in response to employee requests; you need to give your customers tools to do so and direct anyone who requests to exercise their GDPR rights as to customer information to a designated point of contact at the customer.  ie direct them to the controller / your customer.\n\nYour DPA is actually straightforward to write, given you have no plans to share this information ever.  You do need to write one anyway.  You will also want to plan and document retention periods for all this information, and get your customers to agree to them in your DPA.  Be prepared for retention periods to be complex for larger customers, as they intersect with multiple nationalities' employment laws.  You may be well advised to make your customers choose retention periods (possibly with your guidance, but make customers formally control them) so as to remove some liability for getting them wrong.\n\nBy the by, if you're going to do enterprise, you shouldn't do email signups at all -- require saml.  Your customers will highly likely only want that anyway.",

E.g. you don't have to deal with data subject rights *at all*. Instead, you need a thorough data processing agreement (DPA) per Art 28 GDPR, as explained in [xasdfxx\n's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/sk2du8/comment/hvis6t2/?context=3). A notable restriction is that your clients (the actual data controllers) must sign off on all your sub-processors.\n\n> GDPR requires us to store that information on servers in the EU\n\nNot at all. However, if you process (not just store) the data outside of the EU/EEA (or UK, for UK-based controllers), then you have to consider Chapter V of the GDPR which discusses rules on international transfers. This is extra bureaucracy, so you'd probably want to avoid it. The good news is that the EU (and UK) have recognized a number of other countries as offering an “adequate” level of data protection, which allows you to process data there without extra compliance busywork – your DPAs would just need one extra paragraph. For example, you can outsource tasks to Canadian companies under mostly the same rules as for EU vendors. Exporting data to the US is probably illegal, though. As you are a data processor, you might want to avoid contentious data exports anyway as this might scare away potential clients (especially for clients like German SMEs that often care much more about data residency than the GDPR itself).",

Sounds like a lot is missing from their letter and/or privacy policy.\n\nMarket research companies carrying out questionnaires for other companies can either do so as a data processor on behalf of that company, or a joint data controller. If Kantar are determining sample sizes, interview methods, how results are presented and are generally deciding for themselves how the survey is conducted, then they would be a joint data controller with HMRC - this may explain why HMRC have shared Kantar’s privacy policy with you - as if both are data controllers then both would need to have a privacy policy in place. HMRC should definitely have made it clear whether Kantar are acting as a DP or joint DC for this processing - and sounds like they haven’t set this out anywhere for you?\n\nIn terms of the lawful basis. It seems to me that for the sharing of contact details with Kantar the basis will be legitimate interests (although potentially it could also fall under public interests - again, HMRC should make this clear to you somewhere - and I can’t see this detail in their privacy policy). \n\nFor the actual survey itself it sounds like consent is used. So Kantar are given your contact details from HMRC and then will ask for your consent before they take any further info from you to complete the survey. This consent would obviously need to be specific and informed - making it crystal clear to participants how their data would be used. \n\nInterestingly I found that the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport use Kantar and provide a clear privacy notice to data subjects setting out exactly how it works (and in this case Kantar is a data processor acting on their behalf \n). I’m taking it that you didn’t receive a link to one of these from HMRC?\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/participation-survey-privacy-notice#who-is-the-data-controller",

Instead, we must look at the ePrivacy Directive (ePD), which particularizes and complements the GDPR. As an EU directive, every EU member state has its own implementation, but the directive sets a common baseline.\n\nThe `gdpr.eu` page correctly says that you don't need consent for strictly necessary cookies. This mirrors Art 5 ePD, that says that you don't need consent for accessing or storing information on the user's device if this is strictly necessary for providing a service explicitly requested by the user. \n\nWhen the user explicitly selects a particular UI theme, then it seems strictly necessary to store that selection so that it persists across page loads. Then, no consent or cookie banner would be necessary. Without consent, there's nothing to document. It would still be sensible to disclose the use of these cookies e.g. as part of a privacy notice.",

My issue seems a little nuanced so a second opinion would be great - though it might require some familiarity with  web dev. soooo....\n\nI am building a web-app. Users keep their anonymity - though are assigned an ID on registration (simply a 'BEGIN' button). They are asked a series of questions as they progress through the app, similar to a survey, with feedback given after each set of questions. \n\nThe questions relate to user experiences, though no combination of data points can be used to re-identify them. Answers are stored and attributed to a user ID. This allows us to recall answers later and give feedback. It will also allow us to give the user a password so they can recall their session at a later date. \n\nWe maintain that this data does not pertain to a users actual identity and we *only retain data that is necessary for our app to work*. Some of the collected answers are used for research, which is stated clearly in our Privacy Notice. The 'research' part is simply some automated graphs etc showing aggregate trends across answers. \n\nReferencing cookie law, our cookie banner offers users a choice to \n\n\t*i) Persist their login details locally so they can quickly resume there session easily on this device*\n\n\t*ii) opt in to Google Analytics*\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. The data we need for the app to work (arguably 'strictly necessary') is also used for internal research/reporting - two purposes, though we are fully transparent with our intentions. We highlight this both on the registration page and in our Privacy Notice. Both purposes are essential for the app to run, and \"opt-out\" is not really possible in this case. Does GDPR prevent us from generating reports from the data we collect? What is the correct way for us to ask them to agree to this on registration?\n2. By default no data is stored on the users computer, though a user ID is generated on registration and subsequent answers are sent to our server. I would like to persist the ID in localstorage so that the users session can be recalled when they return. Do I need the user to opt in to do this (i.e an option to consent within our cookie banner - above)? Can an \"accept all\" option be used? it is unlikely they will opt in at all if they have to configure each cookie individually with our cookie manager. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.

But, if you really want to go down the anonymous data route, you could consult with your national data protection authority.",

Let's call the company E corp\n\nThe company is an energy-company, that has started a new subdivision with the purpose of creating an app that can monitor the energy usage of users, this part is already in use. What I am hired to do is research if it would be possible to create another platform, linked with the first one that could be used to let users sell excess energy \"credits\" that they earn when they spend less money than their budget. Or use the extra money to invest in green projects.\n\nAnyways, that's not really the important part for this project. I looked through their personal data policy, and found this (this is me translating to english, so it might look a tad funky):\n\n*\"(...) apart from that we also process your data for use in marketing, including contact information, correspondances between you and E corp, measurement data, buying history and geographical data.* \n\n*We collect information about your movements on digital platforms for statistical purposes, and for profiling of you, in order to provide the best service possible. This includes usage statistics from the E corp app. You do have the right to reject this profiling. If you do not wish to be profiled,you should contact us.\"*\n\nThe last part here is what really jumps out to me. That they will be collecting info on me/a user from several digital platforms by default, and only refraining from it if I ask them to. \n\nThis seems to go directly against the [privacy by default policy of gdpr](https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/subjects/privacy-default_en). \n\nAs far as I understand, the user should be made clear that this is going on, and then consent specifically to it.\n\nIs this likely a violation? should I contact my countrys data protection agency?",

So consent is usually not mandatory if you can demonstrate such legitimate interest.\n\nHowever, with the use of tracking technologies (e.g. web beacon, clear gif, cookies, etags...), which are reading or writing info on the user's terminal, you need to also take into consideration the ePrivacy Directive which requires consent as the only possible legal basis, i.e. not possible to rely on legitimate interest, regardless of the balancing test above.\n\nHope this helps to clarify!",

During said phone call, they told me that these surgery dates coincided with \"absence regulations\" and due to this I needed to be spoken with and a meeting was due to be arranged.

Where a consumer is using the service the provider will be a controller.  Things are a bit different where a company is using the service, because then the provider is likely (though not necessarily) a processor rather a controller, which means the provider can’t use the data for its own purposes, but only in accordance with instructions of its customer.

The first phase (forgery detection) is done mostly manually/visually, with a few rule-based prior checks.\n\nAs a research lab, we want to collaborate with our partner to see if we could use more advanced techniques such as neural networks to automate fraud detection, or at the very least streamline the manual part. This is just a study, at the present stage, we do not envision actually deploying our solution, even though we very much hope to be successful.\n\nTo perform this study, this means we have to train our algorithms on their highly sensitive database of prior customer data. We will need to iterate on the testing, isolate the hard cases and most likely manually inspect them to figure what makes our algorithms fail or succeed.\n\nMy question is: what legal basis for processing should we use to handle this personal data? To me, it seems the legitimate interest of both our partner and the data subjects that we attempt to reduce fraud. But our perspective so far is not to concretely deliver a solution, just attempt to deliver one. We could also consider the public interest legal basis, but that seems far fetched. \n\nIn any case, we would have to rely on a legal basis that does not require the data subject's consent, because we can not envision retroactively contacting all our data subjects to ask for their consent. And even if we managed to obtain consent for some of them, this would introduce a lot of bias in our training data set, as the customers who cheat would obviously deny consent.\n\nadditional question: in this matter, are we becoming a secondary controller, or would we still stay a data processor?",

In the specific case of storing consent status with cookies, it's somewhat common to expire the user's decision after 6–24 months and show the consent dialogue again. An indirect legal obligation can be derived from the GDPR's transparency principle.\n\nWhat I think is far more important is to make it easy for the data subject to revoke consent. The ICO website is the only website I know that does this well, since consent controls are always available in the lower left corner. Phones also make it easy to revoke device permissions from apps. If the data controller doesn't offer a way to revoke consent with a couple of clicks, this would clearly heighten the need to occasionally check in with the data subject to ensure that consent is still valid.\n\nIf anything changes about the basis on which consent was given – e.g. if data collected under consent shall be used for additional purposes – then new consent would be mandatory.",

        "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nI work for a charity in the UK, I just wanted to sense check a train of thought before recommending we get proper advice.\n\nGift Aid is a provision in the UK where charities can claim 25p from government for every £1 donated by taxpayers. The government requires a donor's name and address to make sure they're a taxpayer.\n\nWhen Facebook reports to us the donations they've taken on our behalf, some of the donors have requested that Gift Aid be claimed on their donation. Facebook gives us the names and addresses provided by these donors, which we send to the government. Facebook is fairly unique among online platforms; other platforms claim the Gift Aid for us and then hand that amount over rather than giving us the data.\n\nMy understanding is, we can use this data for the purposes of claiming Gift Aid, because:\n\n* Claiming Gift Aid is a legitimate thing we want to do\n* We need names and addresses to do that\n* The data subject's rights are respected, they have a reasonable expectation that Someone will use their data to assess the Gift Aid claim\n\nWe can't then use data from this source to send direct mail to peoples' houses, because the data subject wouldn't reasonably expect us to use their data for marketing.\n\nBut we would like to send them a \"Thank you for donating\" letter, and ask for consent to continue to post them stuff, including marketing.\n\nI'm less sure about this.\n\n* Thanking donors is a legitimate thing we want to do, as is asking for consent to send letters\n* We need names and addresses to do that\n* The data subject Might reasonably expect to be thanked for a donation, and asking for consent to send marketing doesn't itself count as marketing, it's operational\n\nObviously we're going to err on the side of caution, I'm not going to take Reddit's word for it that this is fine, but if it's open-and-shut inappropriate then that saves me looking further into it.\n\nThanks a lot!",

Encryption at rest is more difficult. E.g. full disk encryption and encryption of backups is a very good idea. But row-level encryption only makes sense in a specific security architecture. Importantly, it now becomes important how the keys are managed.

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm looking for some advice or opinions regarding privacy and the GDPR. I apologise for the length of this query, as I need to explain the background. I manage the website of a church in Germany, and I'm the de facto privacy officer for the church. During the corona lockdown, the government allows churches to continue holding Sunday services, so long as the churches enforce certain health measures (face masks, social distancing, no singing, etc), which my church is strictly adhering to.\n\nThe German state that we're located in also has its own statewide \"Corona Ordinance\" law, which stipulates the following:\n\n* People attending church services must register beforehand by providing their contact details to the church - specifically their name, address and phone - meaning that the church must collect this data from the attendees.\n* This personal data is collected \"solely for the purpose of providing information to the Health Department\" in the event of a COVID infection - ie. for \"tracing possible routes of infection\". The data is only given to the Health Department if they request it.\n* Otherwise \"the data shall be saved for a period of four weeks and then deleted.\"\n* \"Any other use \\[of the data\\] is not permitted.\"\n\n(The texts above which are inside \"quotation marks\" are direct quotes from the Corona Ordinance).\n\nIn addition to the above stipulations from the Corona Ordinance, we must also, of course, comply with the GDPR with regards to the processing of this personal data. Our lawful basis for processing the data, per Article 6 of the GDPR, is obviously paragraph (1)(c) - \"compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.\" Which means we don't need to use consent or legitimate interest as our basis.\n\nMy church wants to use our existing church management software to handle the registration process for collecting the contact details of attendees each week. This software comes from a third-party software vendor based in the USA, and it includes an event management feature that we could use to allow attendees to register online for each Sunday's service (similar to buying tickets to an event).\n\nThe software provides its own web portal for us to use, hosted on the vendor's server (ie. not part of our own church website). Attendees would go to the portal, select the upcoming Sunday service, click a Register button, and enter their name/email/phone into a form, after which they'd receive a confirmation email.\n\nHowever: the software actually creates a permanent user profile in its database for each person who registers - basically, an account. This is because the primary focus of the software is managing church membership and church groups, therefore the software's features are built around the concept of member/user \"profiles\", which are like accounts that people can sign into. The event management tool is more of a side-feature that they've tacked onto the software.\n\nThe problem is this: when attendees fill out the form to register for an \"event\" (Sunday service), there is nothing written on the portal page to inform them that a permanent user profile is being created in the backend using the data they're providing. So they think they're just providing their details for the upcoming Sunday service, similar to writing their details on a sheet of paper. They have the expectation that their details will be stored for 4 weeks then destroyed. The web portal neither informs them, nor asks for consent (eg. via a checkbox), to create a user profile/account for them.\n\nWe - the software admins - have the ability to delete the user profiles if we want. So each week, we could delete the profiles of the attendees who haven't registered for a service in the past four weeks, thereby ensuring we don't keep their data for more than four weeks. However, that would not apply to attendees who come to the services regularly - their profiles would remain in the system, because they would have used their profile to attend a service within the previous four weeks.\n\nThis raises some privacy concerns for me, which is where I hope to get some advice:\n\n**Question 1)**\n\nIs it legal, under the GDPR, for the software to create a permanent user profile for the attendees without informing them, and/or without asking their consent?\n\nI don't believe we can use the lawful basis of \"legal obligation\" - Article 6(1)(c) - for this, as the Corona Ordinance does not require us to create a user profile for church attendees. It only requires us to collect name/address/phone details on a per-church-service basis. I'm also not convinced we could - or should - use the basis of \"legitimate interest\" here, either. Given that attendees probably don't have a reasonable expectation of having a profile created for them, and given that it's not a \"must\" for us to create such profiles in order to comply with the requirements of the Corona Ordinance, it seems to me that \"legitimate interest\" can't be used, and instead the lawful basis of \"consent\" must be used. Would you agree?\n\nIt's also worth noting that some of the user profiles will belong to underage children, as parents will enter the details of their children during the registration process. Again, the parents are neither informed, or asked for consent, to have a profile created for their children.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the software also tracks each attendee's IP address, which the GDPR considers to be personal data. There is no option to opt out of this tracking.\n\n**Question 2)**\n\nOn a related note, would the creation of the user profile violate the requirements of the Corona Ordinance itself? Specifically with regards to the stipulation that \"any other use \\[of the data\\] is not permitted\", beyond the stated purpose of collecting the data for \"tracing possible routes of infection\". In other words, would the creation of a user profile constitute an additional \"use\" of the data, beyond the stated purpose, which would violate the requirement that \"any other use\" is not allowed?\n\n**Question 3)**\n\nAttendees who attend Sunday services regularly every week won't have their profiles manually deleted by us - because we'd only be able to delete the profiles which had been inactive for the previous 4 weeks. So those regularly-used profiles would remain in the system indefinitely. Would this violate the requirement of the Corona Ordinance that \"the data shall be saved for a period of four weeks and then deleted\"?\n\n**Question 4)**\n\nIs it allowed for the software to track attendee IP addresses without consent, ie. without providing any way to opt out? The software vendor's portal has its own Privacy Policy where they explain that they track IP Addresses, and I think they claim the basis of \"legitimate interest\" for this. However, they are the data processor, not the data controller, which should mean that it's not up to them to make that decision – rather, it should be up to us, as the data controller, to decide whether IPs are tracked, and whether it's optional, and what lawful basis we use for it - right?\n\nSorry for the long post, and I appreciate those who've made it this far and can provide me with any advice or opinions on these questions - especially if supported by references or evidence of some kind, which I could use to make a case for or against this software.",

                "body": "Question 1) With regard to the data in the user profile that you would be collecting anyway: you don't need a seperate legal basis to hold it in a particular format. Your legal basis for holding names, addresses and phone numbers is the legal obligation under the Corona Ordinance. The fact that you hold two copies of that data due to the way your computer system works is irrelevant.\n\nHowever, you've also advised the system collects IP addresses and that this can't be turned off. Do you know why that is? For example, is there any important website security-related reason why this information is collected? If so, then that my inform the legal basis for storing this data. If not, then strictly speaking, you should not store it. \n\nWhether or not you want to take the risk that comes with storing a user's IP address unnecessarily is up to you. I don't know what GDPR enforcement is like in Germany (I assume it's more thourough than here in the UK - it would be difficult not to be) but I find it hard to imagine a regulator aggressively pursuing you for something like this if you were otherwise doing everything possible to handle data appropriately.\n\nQuestion 2) This is a question about German law moreso than GDPR. However, it doesn't really sound to me like you are using this data for any other purposes. Again, having two copies of it doesn't seem to be relevant. However, Germany and the UK have different legal systems, so I might be missing something vital in this interpretation.\n\nQuestion 3) If I attended on Sunday 13th December and then every Sunday after that, would you still (today, 21st January) have a record of my attendance on 13th December? Or would you only hold my name, address, phone number and records of services I attended in the past four weeks? If the former, then it sounds like you might be holding some data for longer than permitted under the Ordinance. However, again, this is a question for German law.\n\nQuestion 4) Yes, you're right, it should be up to you - not your data processor - to determine the legal basis for collecting attendee's IP addresses. If you do not have a legal basis to do this, you shouldn't collect it - however, see what I wrote above on this topic.",

                "body": "I think your analysis is generally correct so far, so there are only some very few details to fill in. In particular, you are correct that this online solutions seems to have a multitude of compliance challenges. I doubt that you'll ever get this system to perform in an entirely GDPR-compliant way. However, it may be better to have a flawed system than no system at all. Though if it weren't for the prior registration mandate, a paper-based system would be much easier to implement and to do compliantly.\n\nOne aspect you've overlooked is that your software seems to be hosted in the US. Since the Privacy Shield was ruled to be invalid last year, international transfers of personal data into the US are way more difficult to do in a compliant manner. Ideally you would be able to implement supplemental protections, but that's effectively impossible when using SaaS. In this case, the personal data allows inferences about the data subject's religious beliefs and is therefore particularly sensitive.\n\nOn to your questions.\n\n## Q1, Q2: Can the data that was collected for a legal obligation under some Corona ordinance be also used to create a permanent user profile, without information/consent?\n\nWhatever you do, you must provide transparent information. If you collect data from a data subject, you must inform them about the purposes of processing irrespective of the legal basis you're using, see Art 13(1)(c).\n\nProcessing of personal data for a different purpose than it was collected for is permissible in some cases, see Art 6(4) GDPR. However, since your legal basis for collection is a legal obligation, I don't think this section applies. Furthermore, the law in question contains a purpose limitation – you're not allowed to use the data for any other purpose.\n\nIs creating a profile strictly necessary? Definitely not. And whereas the law intends to gather the contact details of persons at an event, your profiles would also make it possible to see which events were visited by a particular person.\n\nSo, I think you really should not be creating such profiles.\n\n## Q3: Would it violate the Corona ordinance to keep profiles active for more than 4 weeks if the data subject has visited more recent events?\n\nYou're required to store the record “event, name, address, phone” and to delete this record after 4 weeks. You are proposing this as a profile containing name/address/phone, which is associated with one or more events.\n\nI think this could be compliant, provided that the association between users and events is severed for all events more than 4 weeks old. So if you can delete an event from a profile, and delete profiles that have no further events left, that could be compliant (except for the issue of combining multiple event records into a profile, which might not be allowed).\n\nWhat's not OK under this legal basis is if you're associating visitors with events that are more than 4 weeks old.\n\n## Q4: Is it permissible to collect IP addresses without consent, because the software used does not allow this to be switched off?\n\nUnder GDPR, any processing of personal data needs a purpose. Processing without a purpose is not permissible. Depending on the purpose, you might be able to find a legal basis such as an “legitimate interest”.\n\nWhere a processing activity is carried out by a data processor, the controller often determines the high-level means and purposes, and the processor fills in non-essential details. For example, the controller might find that a service needs to use appropriate security measures. The processor might implement this by keeping IP logs for such security purposes, for a limited time.\n\nIn the case of IP addresses, you must also consider that these also are traffic data in the sense of the ePrivacy directive (ePD). The German government considers the ePD to be immediately effective law, so that more lax provisions in the TMG are superseded. Under ePD, traffic data can only be used for the purpose of a “transmission” (e.g. for responding to a HTTP request), or in anonymized form, for billing purposes, or when the user has given consent. However, it is generally accepted that some security measures are necessary for the safe provisioning of a service, and could be covered by a legitimate interest.\n\n## What should you do?\n\nYou're trying to make the best of a bad situation. I don't think that this online solution would be entirely GDPR-compliant, but it might contribute to a larger strategy.\n\nOne approach to consider would be to take registrations primarily by phone,\nbut offer the website as a self-service mechanism. Users can freely choose between these mechanisms, so you could ask for consent. However, consent must be informed. It is necessary but not sufficient to write a privacy policy that provides full information in line with Art 13. You should also directly summarize key information at the point where you ask for consent, e.g. above the form for creating a new account. In particular, users should be clearly informed that the online registration is provided as a convenience and is not mandatory to use (link the phone number as an alternative), that the data will be kept in a profile until the account is closed, and that they can read the full privacy policy. Such a “layered approach” is suggested by the [EDPB/WP29 guidelines on transparency (document WP260)](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=622227)\n\nOr you could use a software tool that doesn't suffer the problems of this event management plugin. Setting up such a tool might require far less time than bringing the existing tool into compliance to a sufficient degree, but that's your call.\n\nPlease note that this comment presents my opinion, but just works from the snippets you've provided and definitely cannot replace legal advice.",
