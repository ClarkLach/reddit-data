        "selftext": "**Background:**\n\nIn Denmark, there is an app for a supermarket chain, where you can multiple things: check out using the app; get money back for food gone bad; get discounts offered to all users of the app; get offers personalized to the user based on previous purchases; and a few other things. \n\nThe processing activities mentioned are all performed with reference to a legitimate interest, cf. art. 6(1)(f). I want to be able to do self check-out, but I have objected to the statistics and personalized marketing, cf. article 21.\n\nI have signed up to the app, and given my credit card information, which the supermarket process though a third party provider (Nets), in order to connect any purchases I make to my account, even if I am not scanning the app.\n\n**Question:**\n\nThe supermarket says they will \"accept my objection\". But the way the intend to \"comply\" is to delete my account entirely, which means that I will not be able to use the other features either (such as self check-out). \n\nIs this legal? If not, can you give some legal references (articles, recitals, case law, guides, etc.)?\n\nI have only been able to find information about splitting up consent, not about splitting up legitimate interest activities.\n\nEdit: For clarity: I want to *accept* using LI as a basis for getting money back for food gone bad and self check-out; but I want to *object* to using LI as a basis for personalized marketing.",

                "body": "> Recital 47 states that \"the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.\" So, in some circumstances, it can be used.\n\nDirect marketing and personalized marketing (targeted ads I guess) are two different things. Direct marketing is e.g. if you have already purchased goods or services from them they can send you marketing emails about goods/services related to what you have already purchased. In such a case local law and/or DPAs might consider opt out instead of opt in is ok. That's the case in France for instance (but they must inform you during the initial collect of your email address that if you don't oppose to it they will send you said emails).\n\n>But that is difficult to argue in a complaint. It would be nice with some more specific paragraphs, case law, guides etc. to point to.\n\nAgreed, though I don't know if there are any. And you would probably need to find some from your own DPA, as a lot of people argue that if it's a decision of a foreign DPA it does not count. And other people argue that article 63 and recital 135 say that the decision of one DPA is case law in the whole EU...\n\n>Because it would not be good if I lost a complaint like this, because it sets some de-facto precedence.\n\nIMO it's your DPA's job, not yours. You are already doing way more than the average Joe would and could do by having these conversations on this sub. Your DPA can set precedents, not you, and it's their job to do the legal research.\n\nDPAs are not supposed to be a tribunal before which you bring your findings and legal arguments. They are supposed to register an average Joe's complaint and handle the investigation themselves.",

                "body": "There's a couple things going on, and you're a bit vague, so please lmk if I didn't answer your question.\n\n##### First, re: statistics and personalized marketing\n\nI think the trouble you're having is that statistics and personalized marketing require more analysis to fall under legitimate interests.  Analyzed individually:\n\nStats: if anonymized, almost certainly ok; if not anonymized, could be ok.  There's not a black and white rule here afaik.  It will depend on what stats and what they're used for.\n\nIt's worth nothing that truly anonymized stats, afaik, require no basis at all because they are not personal data and thus not subject to gdpr.  Though this business does not seem to have performed the most careful gdpr analysis.  But it could be that they are merely processing personal data to immediately form anonymized statistics, eg number of check out activities, number of items added to cart, number of programming errors, number of failed checkouts, etc in a matter not tied back to any individual user.\n\nPersonalized marketing: that should probably be requested under the consent basis.  Doing it as LI is likely not ok.  Though this could be overridden perhaps by country-specific marketing laws.  A quick google suggests no, but I am not an expert.\n\nThus I suspect what you should say to them is more along the lines of:\n\nLegitimate interests are not a valid basis for personalized marketing.  Consent is, and I do not consent.  I'd like to get this resolved w/o a complaint to our DPA, but that is my next step.\n\nYou could also consider pointing out grocery purchases may well reveal one of the so-called sensitive categories of data, health.  If you buy condoms, prenatal vitamins, health supplements, or particularly if the grocery offers a pharmacy, lots of information about your health is discoverable via analysis of grocery purchases even w/o a pharmacy.  And extremely sensitive data if the chain includes a pharmacy.\n\n#####  Second, re: purchase connection even when not using the app\n\nI suspect this is on much firmer ground for LI.  After all, if you are eg getting money back for food gone bad, or processing returns, or so forth, you kind of need the full purchase history to do so.  You could complain here, but I don't suspect most DPAs will want to get involved.  That's not a reason not to complain, but expectation setting for if doing so will help.",

They don't control the contents.\n\nThe only useful answer is whomever owns the business process that creates the data.  Some chunk of the org creates, to go back to the earlier example, an airline ticket product.  They are responsible for the data collected.

In the course of your audit, you have flagged this as a potential risk. You have decided that this risk should be mitigated by having the test environment use synthetic data or de-identified data.\n\nIt seems that you do not yet understand who manages this test environment. You've jumped to the conclusion that the database administrators would be doing this, but that's usually not the case. It is likely that the software developers know more about what's going on. If your organization has a separate QA team that uses this test environment, they might be able to help as well. But there's no telling who imported the data there. Could be the database administrators, could be devs, could be a business analyst.\n\nDepending on how this test system is used, there might not be actual risks that have to be mitigated. It might be desirable (and ultimately good for security/privacy) to have a \"beta version\" of the IT system where a couple of end users can use an upcoming version of the system with real data.\n\nOn the other hand, you might find that test systems that are used further left in the development pipeline could work just as well with synthetic data, and that using real data here has unacceptable risks. It would then be necessary to discuss with Devs + QA + other relevant teams what a more compliant test environment would need, and how the necessary work can be prioritized.\n\nIn my personal experience as a software developer, I value testing with (small amounts of) real-world data because it avoids problems where the synthetic test data is accidentally different in some way. Synthetic data can also be more difficult to interpret than a real example. But I take great care to ensure that my tests won't interfere with production systems. If a lot of tests are performed with a database that was created with a snapshot of real data, that suggests that the test strategy for this IT system is insufficiently automated, that it's too much effort to set up a throwaway environment with synthetic data for each test run. It's not enough here to point to your compliance checklist, because changing a testing strategy can take a huge amount of effort.",

You will find this in the ISO 27002:2022, control 8.31 to be precise. Certain configuration data (e.g. organisation structures) can be transferred between environments, but only through allow-lists, through well-defined and monitored processes.\n\nThe responsible line manager or delegate is the issue owner for implementing this control and being able to demonstrate its design, existence and operation. They can be advised and supported by privacy, security, architecture, development or any other discipline, but the responsibility for demonstrating compliance is ultimately theirs. In this instance, one of the aforementioned teams should have the expertise to design a solution for the use case. The issue owner then approves of the solution and the implementation is scheduled, executed and its effectiveness verified. Each step generates the necessary documentation.\n\nIf you don't know who the issue owner is, go up until you know for sure. If you're too high you will be directed down in the organisation structure again. Not having a clear issue owner is a clear lack of governance structure. Generally a C-level executive wants action quick enough when all issues in an audit get their name as responsible because the governance is ill-defined.",

For example, it might be less appropriate to prohibit the use of publicly available personal data in test systems.\n\nHowever, the main point of my above comment is that it is *understandable* that the test system evolved to use personal data, and that *changing* this can be a difficult and expensive process. In practice, it may not be sufficient to point to a compliance checklist and expect things to change overnight. Instead, you'll have to figure out what the value of the status quo is, how that value can be achieved in a more compliant manner, and how to move your organization towards that future. In the best case, you'll be able to identify synergies with other projects that would have value. For example, better automation to set up throwaway test environments would go well together with an initiative to fill those environments with synthetic data.",

Some of these countries are so similar in terms of geography and demographics that they are grouped together and managed as “one market,” even though they are technically two different entities. \n\nI’m wondering about the GDPR implications of this setup, specifically:\n\n1. How can we enable sharing of personal data between these two markets?\n2. Can we create a framework that allows employees in Market A to work on topics and personal data from Market B, and vice versa?\n\nIn some cases, we already have joint controllership agreements in place, but I’m curious whether a broader, general approach could work across departments, or if every procedure and process would need to be specified individually in a framework agreement.",

Ever since I testified against him, he seems to have launched revenge campaign against me which includes persuading other employees against working with me in any capacity. I'm confident that the he has been given access to my personal data without my consent. Specifically, he seems to have access to information related to the activities related to my email account and randomly mentions some very specific things related to my email conversation with others when I'm around him.\n\nTo verify my suspicions I made a SAR to see the recipients who have access to my personal data. However, the university outright refused to disclose the \"internal third parties\" who have access to my personal data claiming. Their phrasing of this refusal was very suspicious and was obviously a work of a lawyer who felt the need to tell me that they can't tell me who are the recipients because in my SAR I didn't specify whether I was talking about \"internal third parties\" with access to my data or \"external third parties\" with access to my data. While they eventually did provide some information about the external recipients, they are refusing to disclose the internal recipients claiming that no law requires them to make these disclosures.\n\nCan someone with good knowledge of GDPR chime in and let me know whether this is a violation of GDPR? Isn't this a violation of the transparency GDPR requires as well as the legal framework which requires organizations to disclose the recipients in response to SAR?",

In my opinion, both a user's profile data and the data of their forum posts are personal data within the scope of the GDPR.\n\nConsider an example of processing user data which, in my opinion, falls squarely into the kind of conduct the GDPR is designed to regulate: I want to go through each user, check how many posts they have made in some interval like from last week until now. I'm doing this in order to identify some subset of my userbase as \"active users\" for some reason. For example, maybe I want to try to sell them Forum Gold awards.\n\nIn GDPR we see\n\n> The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation...access to the personal data and the following information:\n> a. the purposes of the processing;\n> b. the categories of personal data concerned;\n\nSo I would probably want to have some kind of record associated with the determine-active-users job with some info like\n\n\n`ID: determine-active-users`\n\n`Purpose: Determine if user is active`\n\n`Data: User.Posts.created_at`\n\nThat way, I could mechanically build some kind of data usage report in response to a user's request, and presumably be GDPR-compliant (obviously there are other steps).\n\nHowever, suppose a user just presses a button which says \"Show me my profile info\" or \"Show me my post history\" In this case, we're processing personal data, but we're doing it directly in response to a request by that user for their own personal data. Obviously, lots of other steps could be involved, but insofar as all we're doing is reading the requested data from the database and sending it to the user in the form of a web page, this seems intuitively like it isn't the sort of thing the GDPR is intended to regulate. Is it in fact regulated? Do I have to add another record like\n\n`ID: show-my-post-history`\n\n`Purpose: Respond to user request for post history`\n\n`Data: User.Posts.*`\n\nto my GDPR processes log (at least for any user who has ever pressed that button) in order to be compliant? Or can I just say \"Well obviously if the user requests the data, that data was requested; we don't need to tell the user who requested his own data that he requested his own data. That would be silly\"?\n\nI assume that the same logic would apply to any fulfillment of a direct user request, even if it was not just reading out data and sending it to a user. That is, if responding to the \"Show my post history\" button wasn't regulated, a button which calculated statistics for the user (like the length of their average post) wouldn't be regulated either. However, as a data controller, if I created a job to calculate the average post length for all my users (for whatever reason), that would be an example of regulated data processing that I would have to report to my users. This would be true even if the only use I made of the calculated statistics was to respond to the direct user query for their statistics.",

(I'd advise against other media such as CD-ROMs or SD cards since fewer people have necessary drives/readers). For large amounts of data, that can be a fast, cheap, and fairly secure way of providing the data. A more complicated alternative would be a time-limited download link. I'd tend to agree that sending the data over email could be problematic, unless the data is small and the email servers are configured to enforce transport encryption.\n\nIf a data controller doesn't budge and sends you printouts despite your clear requests for an electronic form, consider lodging a complaint with your data protection authority.",

        "author": "aarasmussen",
        "id": "103183g",
        "selftext": "Sorry if this question is odd; I'm kinda new to this whole GDPR matter and don't have a legal background. I'm trying to learn, and I hope you can help me with a question that has popped up during my study on how to become \"GDPR compliant\".\n\nA bit of background for this question. I have a small company situated within the EU (Denmark) and we supply a rather simple SaaS solution for our clients. We are strictly a B2B shop but have customers outside as well as within the EU.\n\nOur application is a kind of \"task management\" application for our customers' employees and by default, we don't hold any more sensitive information other than the employees' name and work-email along with an optional profile picture of them. However, depending on how they use the system they might capture other and more sensitive pieces of information than this.\n\nWe have continuously worked on becoming/being GDPR compliant and have recently engaged a legal company to advise us and while some of their initiatives are great and sensible some are also very different from the guidance we've gotten previously (and much more time-consuming and expensive to follow).\n\nUp until now, we have had a standard DPA available to our clients. The DPA is available via their login to our application and they are notified about changes to the document as well as changes to our sub-processors. Since Schrems II we have done SCC's with a limited number of our sub-processors - only those who we exchange personally identifiable information with.\n\nOur new legal counsel have made it clear that we should change this practice on 3 main points:\n\n1. It is our responsibility to make sure that we have a valid DPA with our clients and that it accounts for the categories and sensitivity of the data they are processing\n2. DPA's needs to be signed by both parties\n3. SCC's are required for all sub-processors - even if they don't process any PII\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(1) This is odd to me. I don't see this being practiced with any other vendors we make use of. They seem to do what we have done previously - make the DPA available with the SCC. From there, it is our responsibility as a client, to make sure that the DPA is sufficient for what we use the system for. \n\n(2) Again, I have never experienced this with any of our own vendors. We can download a signed DPA from them, but never have I experienced that I'll need to send back a signed copy. Nor have I experienced being asked to re-sign the DPA when it is updated. It's always been opt-in by default. Combined with (1) this is going to require a lot more work on our side - especially since they want us to engage with all of our existing clients and collect signatures.\n\n(3) I can't find any information which seems to support that we are required to have a SCC with any sub-processors who we don't exchange PII with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan this really be true? I don't question that it's an acceptable way to do it - but are we really required to be so strict about it? Isn't this too much? Again, I'm not a lawyer, but I've trying to research this as much as I can and can't really find any information that seems to support this kind of approach for a system as simple as ours. Also, as mentioned previously, my own experience when sorting out DPAs with our own vendors doesn't reflect the new approach we're being suggested to follow. (1) and (2) will also make it very tedious to do any updates to our DPA as we'll have to go out and get updated signatures from all clients every single time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time. Hoping for a bit of insight and discussion on this.",

The issue of (2) is probably more an aspect of contract law rather than GDPR specifically. This is outside my wheelhouse.\n\nThe advice on (3) sounds extremely correct to me. \n\nIt's important to understand that GDPR covers *personal data*, which is much broader than PII. Any data that you  or someone else can tie back to a person is personal data, including IP addresses, hashed PII, randomly-generated numbers if they're persistent, or any other pseudonymous identifier or any other data which is tied to a pseudonymous identifier. It also includes data that *you* can't tie back to a person but *your client* could. (Or that law enforcement could.)\n\nIf you can give an example of a processor that you *don't* currently have an SCC with and explain what type of data you share with them, I'd be happy to figure out whether it's personal data or not. Be prepared for the answer that it's probably personal data.",

Article 28(3) requires there to be a written agreement in place between a C/P, but uses passive language and doesn’t explicitly say whose obligation it is.  As you are in the EU, the conservative approach from a compliance perspective would be to always ensure a DPA is in place.  More practically, if you don’t have a DPA and the relationship was ever queried by a regulator (eg in the context of a breach), the presumption would be that you are a controller as there is no agreement in place that requires you to process data only on behalf of your client or that sets out what that processing would be.  I imagine that’s something you would want to avoid.\n\nOn 2, that is ultimately a question for danish law.  In most countries, in my experience of terms have been exchanged and the services have been performed, the agreement will be valid even if it wasn’t executed.\n\nOn 3, if a sub is in the EU, U.K. or another adequate country (or if it has BCRs) then you don’t need SCCs.  You also don’t need SCCs if the sub won’t be processing personal.  Otherwise, you likely need the SCCs",

This is important because as a processor, you have drastically simplified compliance obligations – no need to determine appropriate legal bases, no need to deal with data subject requests. An Art 28 DPA isn't just extra paperwork, it also helps to prove that you are not responsible for various things.\n\n(2) DPAs don't need to be signed, but they need to be a legally binding contract or similar instrument. Potentially, this might be satisfied by an “I agree” checkbox, but signatures are of course less ambiguous.\n\n(3) As pointed out by other comments, review the difference between the GDPR “personal data” concept, and the US “PII” concept. If a vendor is involved with providing your service, it's likely that they are a sub-processor in the GDPR sense. The DPAs with your clients will likely stipulate that you are handling your subprocessors appropriately.",

And we do have a DPA, but our model so far has been to have a reference/URL to our DPA in the Master Agreement we do with our clients. So the DPA is available at all times, and we do keep a changelog for it as well as announce changes to it to our clients. But we haven't explicitly asked for the DPA to be signed - we only have signatures on the Master Agreement.\n\nRegarding (2), yes I assume that this is closer related to danish contract law.

You had valid reason to retain this information/data when I was a user, now that relationship has concluded so you have no reason to keep any information on me as it’s not necessary to be kept for the original reason you collected/used it for and by deleting those accounts I have withdrawn my consent for the continued holding of any information about me. Under GDPR you have to send a response within one calendar month confirming if you will comply with my request. \nRegards\nI’ve obviously added the account names in so it’d be impossible for them to feign ignorance.\n\nI sent it via email to their data protection office which strangely enough isn’t mentioned in their privacy policy.

                "body": "We have to distinguish controller–processor and controller–controller transfers.\n\nFor controller → processor transfers, the controller must ensure that the processor is compliant. The controller needs a sufficient legal basis for performing the processing activities delegated to the processor, but no further legal basis for transferring data. As long as the recipient is willing to enter a processor role, this is generally a very straightforward arrangement with very clear obligations on each party.\n\nFor controller → controller transfers, the receiving controller is responsible for its own compliance, including finding a suitable legal basis for their processing activities. However, the sending controller needs a legal basis for the processing activity of *sharing* their data with the other controller. This could e.g. be achieved if the data subject has given their consent, or if the sharing is necessary for performing a contract with the data subject. A legal basis will be easier to find if it is clear that the recipient will only use the data for limited purposes and in a GDPR-compliant manner.\n\nAs an example of a contractual obligation with the data subject: if an employer is contractually obligated to provide dental care to its employees, that could be a basis for sharing necessary data with a dentist. Though it strikes me as extremely odd that an employer would have such an obligation.\n\nAs a special case of two or more controllers, they might be *joint controllers* who are both responsible for their own compliance, but are determining the purposes of processing together. Again, a legal basis is needed for sharing. However, the GDPR requires that the joint controllers transparently determine their respective compliance obligations. For example, they might designate a single point of contact for data subject requests. So ideally the controllers would sign a contract together. This contract could also include mutual assurances about GDPR compliance.",

I sent a request to share with me what personal data about me they have, which source they obtained it from and also asked for erasure with confirmation. Included my name, email, DOB and IP. After that I just got a response from their official SAR team that I have no account on their system and it is just marketing email and I need to follow unsubscribe link and I replied that I still want to see report about what data they own and erasure confirmation after which I got no response.\n\nSo 30 days are not passed yet but I want to be prepared for the next step, since I have a feeling that I am not going to get a response (company privacy policy includes mention about some personal identification procedure to make sure that I am the person who is related to this data for SAR to be fulfilled but nobody asked me to follow up with my identification) Do I need to notify them that 30 days since my initial request passed before filing a complaint? Do I need to document my emails in some special form to add it to complaint? I am based in UK and I am probably going to use ICO to make a complaint, I see there category about SARs but not really sure if that covers my erasure concerns as well. Is it separate somehow or is it covered by SAR? Is there a general guideline somewhere that I need to follow before filing a complaint?",

I’d say probably not, for a few reasons:\n\n1. Based on OP’s post, the disclosure by the company appears to be in a telephone conversation, and verbal disclosures of information generally don’t fall within scope of the GDPR.\n\n2.  Assuming the GDPR applies, it is unclear from OP’s post whether the information disclosed would  be personal data in the hands of OP.  If the plumber is just “a plumber” to OP, there is probably no disclosure of personal data.\n\n3.  Assuming there is a disclosure of personal data, the company likely has a legitimate interest in telling customers why a plumber is not able to attend an appointment.  Saying “an incident” likely complies with the minimisation principle, and there is no disclosure of special category data or truly private information",

This wording calls for a wide interpretation.\n\nFrom the point of view of the nature of the information, the concept of personal data includes any sort of statements about a person. It covers \"objective\" information, such as the presence of a certain substance in one's blood. It also includes \"subjective\" information, opinions or assessments. This latter sort of statements make up a considerable share of personal data processing in sectors such as banking, for the assessment of the reliability of borrowers (\"Titius is a reliable borrower\"), in insurance (\"Titius is not expected to die soon\") or in employment (\"Titius is a good worker and merits promotion\").”",

It does not just mean name, data of birth and so on. Any information relating to someone, provided there is some means by which you might be able to tell who that person is, is personal data. You don't even need to know their name (you will note that is says \"name...*or*\" anything else about them specifically. You also don't need to know their address or their actual identity - if you can recognise that data relates to a particular person, even from piecing information together, then it's personal data. If there is information which itself is not directly identifying but which is associated with their account (even if that account does not give their actual name or address) then it's personal data. \n\nInformation that someone has driving violations is information relating to that person and is therefore personal data. Information about someone's history of accidents is information relating to that person and is therefore personal data.\n\nIf you don't believe me even after reading the legal definition, here is the CJEU in *Nowak*, where they say that an opinion about or assessment of someone can be personal data:\n\n>The use of the expression ‘any information’ [assigns] a wide scope to [personal data], which is not restricted to information that is sensitive or private, but potentially encompasses all kinds of information, not only objective but also subjective, in the form of opinions and assessments, provided that it ‘relates’ to the data subject [...] it is satisfied where the information, by reason of its content, purpose or effect, is linked to a particular person\n\nInformation linked to someone by its content, its purpose, or its effect is personal data. Doesn't need to have their name or data of birth or address. \n\nHere is the CJEU in the case of *Lindqvist*, where they again say that you don't need to name people and say that simply talking about someone's working conditions and hobbies without giving other information about them can involve personal data:\n\n>the act of referring, on an internet page, to various persons and identifying them by name or by other means, for instance by giving their telephone number or information regarding their working conditions and hobbies, constitutes the processing of personal data \n\nThe highest court with responsibility for interpreting data protection law in the EU says: even without someone's name, information about their working conditions or hobbies can still be personal data! It is therefore inconcievable that information about someone's history of driving violations is not personal data, even if their name is not attached.\n\nThese are the legal precedents you want. The definition of personal data copied directly from GDPR and the decisions of the highest court in the EU on the question of what counts as personal data.\n\nIt does not surprise me that someone building software systems does not understand the true extent of the definition of personal data. I am of course to you some random reddit user, as you say, but in the offline world I am a law academic working in technology regulation who is an expert in data protection law: I lecture on data protection law as it relates to technology, I've published widely in leading peer reviewed legal academic journals on data protection, and I've advised data protection regulators on how to handle tech. I also code, build software, and in the past worked as an academic in a computer science department for years. I am very familiar with the fact that the technology industry is full of people who do not understand data protection law - even where they *think* they do - and that there is a vast amount of unlawful personal data processing going on in tech. Such as, it seems, yours.\n\nIf it wasn't for the fact that it would directly reveal who I am and where I work, I would send you a recording of my lecture earlier this year on the scope of data protection law, including the definition of personal data - what things might count as personal data, when they do and don't count as personal data, and so on. That lecture is two hours long. At least 1 hour 50 minutes of that lecture would be unnecessary if the definition of 'personal data' extended only to things like name and date of birth.\n\nYour legal department is wrong and they have put the business you work for at risk.",

Indeed, the CJEU in *Breyer* said exactly that:\n\n>The use by the EU legislature of the word ‘indirectly’ suggests that, [for information to \tbe] personal data, it is not necessary that that information alone allows the data subject to be identified\n\nIn the situation under discussion in the previous couple of comments\n\n>any data such as name, date of birth, household address, phone number or email address is deemed as personal data and thus falls under GDPR. On the contrary, information such as driving violations or history of accidents (in the case of insurance software system) were not deemed as GDPR-regulated, provided that it didn't contain the aforementioned personal data.\n\nThe context - it being an insurance company's system, drawing a distinction between data like names and data like driving violations - suggests that they're talking about data relating to customers of the insurance company, with the belief that information like the customers' names and addresses and so in is personal data but information about their driving violations and so on is not. This is not correct: whether or not you have an identifier, if the information is associated with a particular person's account then it's likely going to be information relating to that person and therefore personal data falling within the material scope of GDPR\n\nEven if you took away all identifiers from the account - i.e. you pseudonymised the account by removing name, address, etc and were left with only a driving record - that will likely still be personal data because it is associated with a particular account which relates to a specific person. If it is possible to match the driving record with other information - such as information stored by other insurers, or by the police or DVLA, which is not inconcievable if we're talkin about a record of driving offences - it would also still be personal data.\n\nAs the court said in *Breyer*:\n\n>For information to be treated as ‘personal data’ [...] it is not required that all the information enabling the identification of the data subject must be in the hands of one person\n\nIn that case, dynamic IP addresses of visiters to a website operated by the German government were determined by the CJEU to be personal data. The reason for this was that - although the website collected no identifying information about visitors, only their IP address - it would be possible in the case of a criminal offence for the police to take steps to match the IP address to a particular account with the relevant ISP and identify the customer. \n\nData protection 101",

Mere international availability of a website is not sufficient to demonstrate such an intent to target users in the EU/EEA/UK.\n\n\nSo there is indeed a good chance that this forum is not obliged to follow GDPR rules and can ignore your requests. That's an asshole move, but it may be legal.\n\n\nUS law does not prevent websites from complying with the GDPR. Instead, the EU Commission and the UK government have attested that US companies have an essentially equivalent legal environment (if they self-certify under the DPF, but that's irrelevant here). The forum is allowed to delete your personal data, but they're probably not required to. I think the reasoning you cited is totally wrong, but that doesn't change the GDPR aspect.\n\n\nThere are non-legal measures you might want to consider. If a website won't delete your personal data, you can still reduce the harm from this by asking search engine providers to hide specific pages from their results.

At least on paper. Consumers were given the tools to stand up for their fundamental rights, while authorities received serious investigatory powers and the ability to sanction breaches with hefty fines. Nearly 7 years later, the reality is much bleaker. On the occasion of this year’s Data Protection Day on 28 January, [***noyb*** **analysed current EDPB statistics**](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-12/edpb_contributiongdprevaluation_20231212_en.pdf) on the (in)activity of national data protection authorities (DPAs). The data shows that, on average, merely 1.3% of cases before DPAs result in a fine. However, [**data protection professionals say**](https://noyb.eu/en/data-protection-day-74-insiders-see-relevant-violations-most-companies) that fines are the most effective way of ensuring companies comply with the law.\n\n>[EDPB report on DPA activity between 2018 and 2023](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-12/edpb_contributiongdprevaluation_20231212_en.pdf)\n\n>Strict GDPR enforcement only on paper. When the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in May 2018, it promised a shift towards a serious approach to data protection. European consumers affected by privacy violations were given the necessary tools to complain to their national data protection authorities (DPAs) – which were equipped with the necessary powers to investigate all kinds of breaches and issue administrative fines to prevent similar offences in the future. Unfortunately, the last 7 years have shown that this has mostly been wishful thinking. This is confirmed by a new noyb analysis of [EDPB statistics on the authorities’ activity](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-12/edpb_contributiongdprevaluation_20231212_en.pdf) between 2018 and 2023: On average, merely 1.3% of cases before the DPAs actually result in a fine. This is consistent with our own practical experience: Most cases are dragged out over multiple years, before they’re closed with a settlement or entirely thrown out.\n\n>Max Schrems: “European data protection authorities have all the necessary means to adequately sanction GDPR violations and issue fines that would prevent similar violations in the future. Instead, they frequently drag out the negotiations for years – only to decide against the complainant’s interests all too often.”\n\n>No real positive example. While some data protection authorities appear to impose far more fines than others, the figures are all in the single-digit percentage range – or even lower. Having imposed fines in 6.84% of all cases (counting both complaints and own-initiative investigations) between 2018 and 2023, the Slovakian DPA is leading the statistics. It is followed by Bulgaria (4.19%), Cyprus (3.12%), Greece (2.65%) and Croatia (2.54%). At the other end of the spectrum, the Dutch authority has issued fines in 0.03% (!) of all cases, closely followed by France (0.10%), Poland (0.18%), Finland (0.21%), Sweden (0.25%) and of course Ireland (0.26%). The remaining countries are somewhere in between.\n\n>[**Click here to see the fully interactive version of the map below.**](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/6KLw9/)\n\n>[**Click here to see the fully interactive version of the map above.**](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/6KLw9/)\n\n>A phenomenon specific to data protection. This apparent lack of serious consequences for breaches of the law seems to be very specific to data protection. Let’s take Spain as an example: In 2022, the Spanish DPA [received 15,128 complaints](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-12/edpb_contributiongdprevaluation_20231212_en.pdf#page=35), but issued[ only 378 fines](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-12/edpb_contributiongdprevaluation_20231212_en.pdf#page=52). This means that, statistically, only 2.5% of all complaints ended in a fine. This includes obvious breaches such as unanswered access requests or unlawful cookie banners, which could – in theory - be dealt with quickly and in a standardised manner. By way of comparison: [3.7 million speeding tickets were issued in Spain](https://motor.elpais.com/actualidad/cuantas-multas-pone-al-dia-la-dgt/) in 2022 (excluding the Basque Country and Catalonia). A similar comparison can be made for basically any [other EU Member States](https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-data-protection-authority-slammed-cjeu).\n\n>Max Schrems: “Somehow it's only data protection authorities that can't be motivated to actually enforce the law they're entrusted with. In every other area, breaches of the law regularly result in monetary fines and sanctions. At the moment, DPAs often seem to be acting in the interests of companies rather than the people concerned.\"\n\n>The data shows: more fines = more compliance. While these numbers are hardly surprising, they’re alarming nonetheless. [A *noyb* survey among data protection professionals](https://noyb.eu/en/data-protection-day-74-insiders-see-relevant-violations-most-companies) shows that it is precisely monetary fines that motivate companies to comply with the law. When asked about the most effective enforcement measures, 67.4% of respondents said that DPA decisions against their own company that include a fine will influence decision makers to opt for more compliance. Interestingly, 61.5% of respondents said that even DPA fines against other organisations would influence their own company’s GDPR compliance.\n\n>[**Click here to see the fully interactive graph below.**](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/w5Ef4/)\n\n>[**Click here to see the fully interactive graph above.**](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/w5Ef4/)\n\n>Imposed fines are a joke. Taking a closer look at the amount of fines the national authorities impose every year, makes the issue even clearer. Ireland (€475,902,000 average fine amount/year) and Luxemburg (€124,395,729 average fine amount/year) are leading the statistics between 2018 and 2023 by far. At first glance, that might sounds like a lot of money. But it really isn’t. Almost all major tech companies like Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft are located in Ireland, making the Irish DPC the lead authority for some of the biggest cases ever. Luxembourg, on the other hand, is responsible for companies like Amazon. In reality, the DPC has to be forced to its own good fortune. [*noyb*’s two biggest](https://noyb.eu/en/edpb-decision-facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-stop-transfers-fine-and-repatriation) cases [against](https://noyb.eu/en/breaking-meta-prohibited-use-personal-data-advertising) [Meta](https://noyb.eu/en/just-eu-55-million-whatsapp-dpc-finally-gives-finger-edpb) had to take a detour to the EDPB before the DPC finally fined the company a total of almost €1.6 billion. If you take away this sum, there’s not much left.\n\n>More budget, more decisions? Some authorities repeatedly argue that they would only need more budget and resources to make more timely – and high-impact - decisions. Looking at [the EDPB statistics](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-12/edpb_contributiongdprevaluation_20231212_en.pdf#page=31), the authorities’ budget increased up to 130% between 2020 and 2024. The Dutch authority, for example, recorded a budget increase of 62% within four years – without a significant increase of fines imposed. To put this into perspective: In 2023, the Dutch DPA had a budget of almost €37 million, but only imposed imposed €1.98 million in fines. This is a difference of almost €35 million, which will leave a huge hole in the state budget. However, this shortfall could be offset by strong enforcement. GDPR fines go to the state of the leading authority.\n\n>[**Click here to see the fully interactive graph below.**](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/D8Rx3/)\n\n>[**Click here to see the fully interactive graph above.**](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/D8Rx3/)\n\n>Almost 40% of all fines thanks to noyb. This pattern can be seen throughout the EU: Between 2018 and 2023, all EU data protection authorities imposed a combined total of €4.29 billion in fines – of which €1.69 billion resulted from noyb litigation. In other words: Almost 40% of all GDPR fines trace back to noyb. This means that, in reality, there rather seems to be a lack of political willpower to stand up against tech giants than a lack of possibilities to [act.Data](http://act.Data) Protection Day: Only 1.3% of cases before EU DPAs result in a fine\n\n[National Administrative Procedures and DPA inactivity](https://noyb.eu/en/project/national-administrative-procedure)",

They have been aware of the need to repair leaks in the roof since March 2024 and have failed to do so. \n\nI am in the early stages of pursuing action against them. To support my case, I am trying to show that they have been negligent in failing to gain approval from all owners for the required work (they need unanimous approval to proceed). \n\nI wish to use a SAR under Article 15 of GDPR to:\n\n- view a record of their attempts to communicate with ALL owners in order to secure approval for the works\n- on the understanding that names, contact details, flat numbers, etc can be redacted to preserve confidentiality around identifying details. \n\nI believe I am entitles to this as:\n\n- data about my property counts as personal data about me as a data subject, given that the address is identifiable\n- communications with other owners affected my rights and responsibilities as a co-owner to carry out timely repairs to common areas, and can therefore be viewed with suitable redactions\n- pseudomisation (eg, refer to owners as just flat A, flat B etc) can allow me to track multiple instances of communication without identifying specific individuals.\nI’ve never done this before.

He wanted to see transcripts for a live chat I did which wasn't resolved, so he wrote that I was a joint tenant at the house and that I gave my permission for my data to be included \"in relation to our account at <our old address>\" (his exact words). \n\n  \n**SAR 2** \\- **My data (no account ever/separate legal issue)** \\-  \nI wrote I wanted all records of my personal data about **\"any and all\"** accounts and records of my data shared with external agencies.\n\n***I was purposely vague because they they really shouldn't have much on me, but also because I have an issue that does not involve my partner*** *(A debt collector is harassing me -they want me to pay for an overdue British Gas bill at the same address after we'd moved out - so it has a different account number. I want to know if BG has handled my data properly).*\n\nBritish Gas only replied to my partners SAR, but they addressed it to both of us and CC'd me in. He sent them his ID and phone number, and they confirmed a date for the SAR without my ID.\n\nAfter a month, I told him his SAR was late and he forwarded me an email I hadn't been CC'd in. It said ***your request may be late due to \"some unexpected resourcing issues.\"*** \n\nMeanwhile, the debt collectors contacted me again, ignoring my request for documents/evidence on the account they expect me to pay hundreds for.\n\n**So I decided to try my SAR again. I sent a new email (with my ID) to British Gas saying:** \n\n\"I sent a SAR for my personal data on <date> but I understand you need my ID\" and then copied my original SAR, but I made it clearer by saying to include my data linked to the account number that is on the debt letter. I also asked for any records with my name linked to BW Legal and said I hoped to receive it in a month.\n\nWhen I got a response, it was a generic one \"we are searching for your data... please provide a phone number if you haven't\" and thanking me for my ID, with my SAR at the bottom. Only they CC'd my partner in and addressed the email to us both.\n\n**My questions are**\n\nAre they allowed to CC him into my request when I didn't mention his name or account?\n\nIs it possible they're treating it as 1 request due to us living together and his statement about me giving permission to share my data linked to \"our account?\" Surely they need proper permission to combine them.\n\nEven though I didn't respond to the first email chain with my ID, and then focused my SAR on a different account?\n\nI know I'm overthinking things, but they've already missed his deadline and I'm worried that I've been confusing or its because they won't give us anything due to the legal thing. \n\n",

I did read online before writing this that they did things in the correct way. I guess it just surprised me.\n\nSo with my partner's SARs, our metre readings didn't always make sense and we paid an excessive amount of money - much higher than most 3 bedrooms. And our final bill says \"estimated metre reading\" even though we submitted them. But due to their app change a couple of months before we moved, it wiped all our bills and readings from our account.   \n  \nAfter being 97th in the queue and reporting a problem, I think it sort of got resolved but I never heard back (this will be the only thing that might be in my name). And loads of times I input metre readings the app told me it didn't look right and they'd investigate, or my metre reading would change numbers after we submit it. \n\nThen a year after we moved, debt collectors started hassling me about a bill starting the day after we moved out. I told them the property was vacant and it was the landlady's bill (I also suspect we paid her bill from before we moved in, we had such a hard time setting up our account when we moved into that house). I even sent my tenancy contract showing I lived elsewhere, and the final bill paid off (in my partners name) but they won't accept this. Instead, they sent a letter of claim saying I was refusing to work with them on the issue. I sent them an official dispute letter and asked them to prove it. They ignored this.\n\nWhen I first asked BW Legal, they told me that British Gas sent the debt to them under the name \"the occupiers.\" Now they're saying British Gas gave them the debt in MY name. I have no idea if they're lying or how British Gas would have got my name to give them. I was going to do the SAR and then when I had the info, put in a complaint to whoever can help me with this",

If you are starting from scratch, one of your first steps shoudl be conducting personal data inventory. It should include:\n\n* Knowing where personal data is stored (including physically, logically, with whom)\n* If it is considered a special category of data\n* How it was obtained\n* What was the legal basis for obtaining it\n* How is it used\n* How long do you keep it\n* Who do you share it with (internally and externally)\n\nNext perform a risk assessment; look outside then inward.  i.e. What are the external risks regarding the state of your GDPR compliance that would invite scruitiny from the public or a regulator. Similar to any other certification, start small because you'll grind your company to a halt if you try to get everyting compliant all at once.\n\nIf you have a legal team and you are doing B2B, I would ask who is in charge with your data processing agreements and see if they can walk you through your contractual obligations are.\n\nI wouldn't touch an AI product unless you have spent some time understanding what you're needs are.

You can send an Article 15 request to get the data they have on you, you can send an article 17 request to stop processing (you should get put on a suppression list).

Many companies probably just take the risk, assuming few customers will report them. It's disheartening, especially for those of us who work in industries that are strict about data privacy. I think increased awareness and pressure from consumers will be the best way to tackle this issue, alongside stronger enforcement from regulators.",

        "selftext": "Evening all\n\nI'm from NI, worked in tech for a while in Belfast, and been getting more and more annoyed with the current norm of 'opting-out' of data collection for training AI models. People feel strongly about their data being used to train AI, so it seems as though it's implemented in this way to the benefit of service providers - to take advantage of users not knowing / not logging into old accounts / not checking their emails to know there are changes.\n\nIt's my belief that the UK government should be mandating the implementation of a completely transparent Opt-In system when services are training AI models with user data. It should let users know exactly how their data is going to be used, and let them choose to consent.\n\nI'm putting the following forward, for awareness & a bit of chat if nothing else (knowing the GOV UK petition system). It'll need a few signatures before it's approved to be a full petition, but I'd like to know how you're feeling about the current state of things? Happy to hear from those that are fine with the current system as well for a bit of perspective. Cheers!\n\n**The petition:**\n\n>**AI Training Data Should Be Collected on an Opt-In Basis**\n\n>Users should be met with a prompt allowing them to choose to opt in to their data being used for AI training: A. When using the service for the first time OR B. On first time use of the service after implementation of a feature / policy change that allows user data to be used to train AI models.\n\n>Websites deliberately rely on opt-out to harvest more data than users would willingly provide. Given the controversy around using user data for AI training, an opt-out approach further undermines trust in service providers’ honesty and transparency. The current opt-out system for AI training assumes consent by default and shifts responsibility onto users, without requiring explicit approval for how their data is used. Opt-in would allow users to make an explicit, informed choice.\n\n>[Sign the petition](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/744986/sponsors/new?token=ocdpi3Fa1VSMoBdxHJsj)\n\n  \n(edit: formatted petition into a quote block)",

Yeah you're absolutely right - I think this also speaks to the lack of transparency around exactly what \"user data\" is being used by services and what exactly it's training. That's 100% the first step. It seems as though there's been no attempt to enforce informing users of even the most clear cut data being used, even overlooking cases like mouse clicks / metadata. Photos, videos, text. Edge cases shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater - this stuff needs to be clearly addressed.\n\nTo your point, I'm imagining for example that I don't want any pictures of myself included in AI training data, but I'm fine with public text posts. How are we supposed to know that services are using one over the other?\n\nTo take one example: the info on the LinkedIn opt out page.\n\n>**Data for Generative AI Improvement**\n\n>Can LinkedIn and its affiliates use your personal data and content you create on LinkedIn to train generative AI models that create content? \\[YES/NO\\]\n\n>When this setting is on, LinkedIn and its affiliates can use your data and content to train content-generating AI models that are used in product features. The data we use for this purpose does not include your private messages. \\[[Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6278444)\\]\n\nBut what DOES it include? What product features? And why is the Learn More page formatted in a way that makes it impossible to parse exactly what data's being used? Why did it take me 8 clicks to get there?\n\nI think in my head a clear goal like 'users need to opt in to consent to AI training on user data' would force service providers to:\n\nA. Fully understand what data they're using to train models so they know if they're collecting PII (working in tech I know that privacy & security assessments often get put off until the verrry last minute when developing features at large companies, if they get completed at all)  \nB. Inform the user of exactly what PII data is being used to train models in a clear & concise way, so that they can untick checkboxes much in the same way that 'optional cookie consent' works.

The article before it states that such criminal fines can also be applied to, and I translate; 'subcontractors' of the processor or controller for regular GDPR breaches (eg: not getting consent when user consent is required for processing).\n\nI deduct from this that a DPO-as-a-Service contractor can be held financially liable and can even be criminally prosecuted, but, using an 'a contrario' reasoning, an employee only when it pertains to leaking governmental personal data (think: informing the subject of their own Passenger Name Records on file). [See art. 222 en 223 of this Belgian law](https://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&la=N&cn=2018073046&table_name=wet).\n\nEDIT: To summarise, it is expected that an employee is protected by their employment contract except for egregious mistakes (like leaking classified stuff). What about a DPO contractor? They are liable for civil damages (wrong legal advice), again standard, but does the GDPR or any national legislation implementing the GDPR make them *personally* liable? It seems so, in article 222 of this Belgian law.\n\nFINAL EDIT/ANSWER: **Yes, in Belgium, a DPO contractor can be held criminally liable for a mistake and get fined directly through the criminal justice system, although the company that contracted him/her will have to cough up the fine ex art. 228**: ['This means that the criminal fine imposed on a data protection officer will be paid by the controller, even though the criminal conviction will appear on the data protection officer’s criminal record'](https://v-ict-or.be/nieuws/2021/06/14/de-avg-en-strafsancties), according to this legal blog.

I think this was originally required by US government, and later it rolled out to products in other countries. Electronic Frontier Foundation has submitted reports requiring disclosure regarding how these were used and by whom, but got no response, and no UK or Europe based organisation have done something similar yet.\n\nI'm wondering that these type of tracking, especially when it's not disclosed from manufacturer/seller to customers, employer to employee (regarding company owned printers), printshop owner to its customers, etc. is compliant to GDPR? Because I think although printer serial number and print time is not directly personal information, if it can be used in a way to identify a person, it still counts?

It's their responsibility to demonstrate that interest/basis (and provide details of a balancing test/assessment being carried out if they are relying on legitimate interest) so if they fail in that responsibility, then you're equipped with the basis of a complaint.  So they need to prove it rather than you -  if they fail to do so, then you can flag that fact up with a regulator.  It's not you proving anything exactly, but again that's possibly semantics.  I get what you mean.\n\nI'm in the UK but the best advice to anyone wanting to contact the regulator and actually get their attention is to go armed with some kind of documentary evidence.  The evidence that would be most compelling would be to contact LinkedIn and ask for an explanation - if the explanation you get is unsatisfactory then you would probably need to exhaust LinkedIn's complaint process and only then refer to the regulator if you don't get a proper resolution.\n\nOtherwise the first question a regulator will ask is \"Have you asked LinkedIn about this and what did they say?\".  One thing they are very reluctant to do is to intervene when someone hasn't really engaged with the company in question.  It may be different in the Netherlands, but I would suspect this is a universal experience.\n\nAnd yes - agree with what you say about LinkedIn facilitating this, but there may be reasons why \\*some\\* jobs need specific addresses and some can be satisfied with a more generalised location - I genuinely don't know.  And it might be that LinkedIn does not police that choice when it's made by the employer, they just assume they know what they're doing and why or have a contractual clause which states that the employer is liable for the decisions they make using the form and that they should check what they are asking for is legal/proportional.  So that could be another avenue for a complaint against LinkedIn/the employer but you'd ideally need something to demonstrate that.  \n\nThe regulator won't generally smash down any doors and seize servers etc over something like this so you kind of need to make it really clear and lay out why you think what they're doing is unfair and unnecessary.  That's a lot easier if you have their explanation (assuming it's flimsy or unsatisfactory).",

If you haven't done this they will probably just contact LinkedIn with a proforma letter/email and ask them something eminently ignorable along the lines of \"are you sure you've got this right?\".  To which they can quite simply just say \"Yep, all good thanks\" and that will pretty much be the end of it.  \n  \nAnd with 3. you can frame it that way but I might be tempted to approach it to say you're dissatisfied, explain you believe LinkedIn/employers are collecting data in excess of what is strictly required in contravention of the principle of purpose limitation (article 5(1)(b) of the GDPR), lay out the reasoning for the regulator (with the documented responses you've received) and ask the regulator to rule on whether it's a violation and to take appropriate action.\n\nAs with any regulator they might not agree, they might agree but not be sufficiently energised to do anything about it, they might make some tut-tut noises and send a stiffly worded letter, they might do something else altogether.

I have no experience of the Dutch regulator at all.  As I say above, I think this is broadly solid advice with any regulator concerning the GDPR though.

It is not sufficient that you “believe” that the request is manifestly unfounded, you must be able to “demonstrate” it and explain the reasons in your rejection of the request.\n\nThe ICO has some guidance on how to determine whether a DSAR is manifestly unfounded or excessive, but warns that you shouldn't have a blanket policy to reject certain requests: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/right-of-access/when-can-we-refuse-to-comply-with-a-request/\n\nIt may end up cheaper to just fulfil the request, even if you suspect that it wasn't made in good faith. It's a lot easier to demonstrate that you don't have to fulfil the request if there's a *pattern* of requests, but this in turn means that the 1st one is difficult to reject – unless the data subject outright *says* they're only submitting the DSAR to harass you.",

        "selftext": "\nLast year I received a letter from a large solicitors company on behalf of their client saying that they suspected me of a fraud of nearly £400,000.\nI was not involved in the fraud in any way - I did not know the people, email addresses, companies mentioned in the letter at all.\nAt first it was a hoax so I reported it to the police. I had received the letter at 8pm on a Friday evening and despite trying to contact the solicitors over the weekend via an inbox they said was monitored at weekends I got no reply. Eventually I called on Monday morning (which I recorded) and the solicitor confirmed that there wasn’t a mistake, they were a legitimate law company and they did suspect me of the fraud. The letter stated that I had three days to respond so I took emergency leave from work and called round solicitors to see if anybody could help me prove my innocence.\nThe three day turn around meant that most people I called could not help but by the 7th phone call I found a solicitor. I did not have the money to pay for a solicitor so borrowed from my mom.\nMeanwhile I felt sick and anxious. I had insomnia. The letter mentioned the use of private investigators and I didn’t want to do things like open my curtains.\nAnyway to cut a long story short, after spending hours and hours trying, I managed to get a letter from the bank involved in the fraud confirming that the account did not belong to me.\nHowever, obviously I now wanted my legal fees back as well as the cost of the Ring doorbell I bought for peace of mind of who was coming near my property.\nI wrote to the solicitors who sent the letter and they said that they simply acted on behalf of their client and the DSAR only contained communication between me and them as they said other information was protected by legal privledge because the case was ongoing .\nI then submitted a DSAR to their client - who did not even acknowledge my email - after month passed and I contacted them via social media which then prompted them to reply to me via email. The company apologised for the mistake which happened as a result of “human error” and offered to pay back my legal fees and ring doorbell. This was around a month ago and the money is still not in my bank account.\nHowever, no DSAR request came through. I continued to chase the DSAR and involved the ICO. Eventually after 4 more months they provided me with a DSAR which is basically just a trail of my emails and their responses. Citing again legal privledge for data not being shared beyond this eg with their legal representation . It appears the person they are pursuing has a name very similar to mine and the case is ongoing. \nYesterday the ICO wrote to me with a conclusion. They said that they were able to have their legal privledge but they did breach data protection because they admitted to it being a human error that has led to my distress.\nBecause of the amount of distress this has caused me and the amount of time I have had to invest proving my innocence and trying to figure out how this error happened (for fear that I might be accused again if closely linked to the person committing the crimes)\nThe ICO are now writing to the company to ask them to provide me with more information beyond “human error” so I can have peace of mind. \nSo if you are still here reading, I’m wondering because of this if I am able to claim compensation and if so how much might I get? \nThank you if you made it this far!\n",

I've read that appointing a GDPR representative is required if you're targeting those regions—but the rep fees seem pretty steep for a business that might not get many international sales at first. For example, Shopify already shows a visitor from the UK, but I’m unsure how meaningful that is.\n\nIs blocking traffic from Europe and the UK a practical workaround some of you have used at the early stage? If so, how do you go about implementing it properly?

If you plan to allow traffic from the EU (even if just visitors, not customers) there are a few first steps you need to look into.

They agree when you show a cookie banner and they get to explicitly say yes or no. Then - these \"consent signals\" get sent to each platform.  \n  \nIt is great you are reaching out about this now as there is info that Google has just started to suspend and flag accounts which do not handle user data in a compliant way on their website. What happens is Google is turning off their campaigns which use personalized targeting, remarketing campaigns and Conversion tracking. It's a pretty big shift but at the same time - the overall rules are not that hard to handle, you just need to understand the basics and use the created tools for the job - Shopify compliance apps, set up Google Consent Mode for your Google tools, show a cookie banner, make sure cookie banner is designed compliantly, be able to handle requests from users in a timely manner when they want to delete/edit their account data.  \n  \nIf you search around you will se that most gdpr violations are due to misleading cookie design, tracking firing before consent, no log of user consent (example you need to track and keep a record of users who have said agree/reject on the banner).

As stated medical data is sensitive.

It could (and highly likely would) be judged that it is unreasonable to ask the Data Subject to go to that one office where they are processing those requests in person. You could see it as a MFA you provided information that would identify the Data subject, but the data is sensitive enough for the data processor to ask for a second thing to verify who they are. Scans or photos do have metadata that the average user isn't able to manipulate, so IF the person who was asking and did provide the ID wasn't the subject, you would have a case of stolen identity on your hands. Something a data processor isn't able to easily handle as those cases are difficult and bound to go to court for a long time. As both the data processor and the data subject would be victims of a crime\n\n>  \nIf the hospital would then argue that they are taking steps to verify identity as best they can, I would counter that the man with the hospital bracelet on making the request in the building is more verified than an email with a PDF doc?\n\nHere comes procedure as a factor. You made a request that was for your dad, where you asked for data on behalf of your dad, that should be sent to a location that is possible (I do not know the data that the NHS is storing so assumption) not matching with their current data and the one processing your request and the one who was given your request might (which is highly likely) not be the same person. On top comes that unless you are specifically asking for data that is related to one incidient or time, you are asking for ALL the data they have. \n\n>  \nAs I've said in other comments, asking for ID is absolutely reasonable when done at the start of the process, but their team telling me it's a legal requirement on day 31 of the request is nonsense & actually serves no purpose.\n\nAs mentioned before, yes that is a shitty move, either they are trying to avoid doing the job and sending this out so that you are not responding. Or (which is more likely) they are backlogged and using the last day request as a buffer until they have to fullfil it.\n\n>I get that hospitals need to cover their arse, but this is extremely easy to fake if anyone wanted to.\n\nAnd that is one of the funny parts about the GDPR it works under the assumption that the requester and proecssor are not being vicitims of crimes that give people the means to abuse the data subject rights under GDPR  \n\n\n>He is a human being & should be being treated with respect at the end of his life.\n\nI agree with you on that, so I hope that you understand that my responses where on the request for an ID is a valid thing and why you can't get around providing it.

I doubt that the driving school has access to all of the metadata about me that the app developer holds on to.\n\nI don’t see anything in Article 28 that implies that this app developer can withhold my data information from me, but my lack of expertise doesn’t work in my favor here.

You're not collecting the guests' login data, you're just allowing them to use equipment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, I think it's 50-50 to be honest. You're not forcing guests to use the Roku or log in - but it's probably worth checking it after guests leave, to ensure they did log out.\n\nBut also, how could you know which services guests have logged into? So the onus really should be on them to log themselves out before they leave. \n\nI think adding a note or disclaimer, eg in a pouch also containing the Roku remote (or whatever), would be a good idea. If you wanted to be extra-sure, you could get guests to specifically agree that they will log out of any services they log into, as a condition of getting access to the Roku. \n\n>my elderly parents are terrified they're going to get into trouble for something they knew nothing about.\n\nAs ever, it's not possible to say with absolute certainty - but I am 99.9% sure that your parents will not get in any trouble at all over this.\n\nEven if the unhappy guest complained to the ICO, the regulator is pretty toothless at the moment, and dealing with a massive backlog. At most, they might write a letter reminding your parents of their responsibilities, etc. I would be hugely, vastly surprised if there was any action beyond that - it's simply not worth it.\n\nEqually, if the guest tried to start court action over this, I think the lack of harm or distress to them will mean they don't get very far. Given they are complaining about a *previous* guest not logging out, they can't even say they themselves have suffered a GDPR breach. \n\n(As evidenced by a lot of posts in this sub, some people have *very* funny ideas about GDPR.)\n\nSo, this really should not be anything to worry about.",

Mainly concerning a situation in which patients that had appointments booked found themselves being sent home with a new date to be sent - still TBC in July.\n\n**The details:**\nOn Good Friday, a private hospital was hacked and 6 patient details were posted online which the hospital states it has handled with their data regulator through a news post update on their website.\n\nTheir disaster recovery process for this as explained by their DPO meant a full wipe and re-installation of all systems. During this, a period of appointment data booked from 2 weeks before Good Friday was unavailable from their back up until restored fully on June 17th. \n\nThe impact as the DPO has admitted is that on April 23rd it was identified that anyone with a booked appointment during that two week period that were due to be seen between Good Friday and June 17th were not registered with their system so the appointments didn’t exist. \n\nNow that the context is out of the way:\n* Is the temporary loss of this data considered a data breach under data availability definitions? \n* If so, are they required to provide an update on the impact to patients to their data regulator following the initial report? \n* What would be usual best practices for a situation like this? \n* There has been no mention of this in their statements nor has there been any follow-up comms sent to these patients - If it is considered a breach, I would assume there is some directive regarding informing data subjects about the impact?\n\nAppreciate any insight!

Also, the data was not lost in the normal definition of the word, but temporarily unavailable if I understand what you said about the wipe/reinstallation process.  I guess \"lost access\" to it for a temporary period might apply, but this is not unusual - lots of systems will restrict data availability during backup/admin processes running (usually late at night).  Equally if there's a power cut, you're in the same boat.  \n  \nWhy this was a binary choice (ie address security vulnerabilities OR keep two weeks' of appointments) is not clear and would be a fair question.  \nAnother relevant question is why they hadn't anticipated this before starting the reinstallation/wipe processes and made arrangements to move appointments data so it continued to be available (eg to a paper system).  \nAlso, why it took two weeks (this seems like a long time to me) to get systems back in a way they could retrieve appointment data from.  These are again business complaints rather than explicitly GDPR ones.\n\n\\* the regulator will have defined what actions it expects the company to carry out - this might include contacting data subjects and explaining that there have been further issues caused by trying to address the original issue.  (But see next point)\n\n\\* as alluded to above, you're relying on a company having a business continuity plan which allows them to continue with their core operations in the absence of IT systems.  This isn't a GDPR-specific provision, it's just sensible.  \nI do think that the hospital could have sent out a mailing to ALL patients - assuming this function was available (they clearly still had access to their website if nothing else) - to indicate that appointments data was temporarily unavailable and to ask those people with booked appointments to contact them (providing confirmation of their booking) to manually reconstruct the schedule.  Again, this isn't really GDPR specific it just seems good business practice.\n\n\\* as above, I am not sure that data being unavailable for use in the midst of recovering from a security breach can be considered a breach in and of itself.  I am not sure which principle would have been breached here and there's a good argument to say that safeguarding data for all patients was worth it when balanced against the temporary disruption to some.    \n  \nIt is inconvenient, seems to imply poor planning / business continuity but data (outside of the 6 patients mentioned in your second paragraph) was not lost or misused.  It was just unavailable whilst they dealt with the hacking problem.",

As Safe mentioned I would have expected that if it was reported, contacting the data subjects would be recommended?\n\nI think this comes down to whether you believe this is a breach at all.  As I say, I am not sure it is.  Your complaint is essentially around the fact that their (entirely understandable) disaster recovery process did not preserve the scheduled appointment before being triggered.  Also, the fact they didn't even seem aware until you pointed it out again seems grounds for a complaint (though I am struggling to understand how this could be - surely this would affect everyone booked for an appointment in that two-week window?  Surely they would realise very quickly when the first person turned up?).  \nI would say this is about their processes being suboptimal, but I struggle to see much fruitful grounds for complaint on GDPR/data protection grounds specifically.",

        "author": "Weekly-Nectarine",
        "id": "1m31whh",
        "selftext": "Afternoon all\n\nI am an officer in a sports club for an \"extreme sport\".  The sports club is subject to governance by a national governing body (NGB), which all club members (and constituting clubs) must belong to.  The NGB has just transitioned to a new web service for member management, including training and qualifications. \n\nOne of my club members is also a member of another club.  He is a qualified instructor and can award members qualifications through the new web service.  He brought to my attention that as an instructor, he has access to all personal information of members held on the web service, in every club in which he is a member.  This is information such as name and address, mobile phone number and email address.\n\nIt appears this is set by default for all instructors, and confirmed by other club members who are in my club.  The issue which gave rise to concern was that the club member who brought this to my attention noticed that he was provided with information of a member of another club who is a minor.  In his view, and in mine, this constitutes a GDPR breach and a safeguarding near miss.  There is no need for my club member to see the personal contact details of other club members, in our or any other club.  Should a training need arise for contact then that information should be shared with consent.  \n\nI submitted a formal notification to the NGB and have just received the response, copied below but anonymised because I don't want to publicly throw the NGB under the bus:\n\n>We have investigated your complaint and have looked into the issue thoroughly.  We can confirm that (instructor), according to our systems (new and old), was an active member of (other club), hence having access to the individual you identified as (minor).\n\n>(NGB) took legal advice on the data set up and this was cleared, many other NGBs use the same system set up via (provider). The data is set up as detailed in our GDPR policy and for the stated purposes. Contact and qualification data is only visible to officers and fully qualified instructors within their own club or clubs and does include U18 information if there are Juniors within the club.  \n\n> **Why Instructors Need Access to Member Info**\n\n> To deliver safe and effective training, instructors have a responsibility to follow (NGB) standards and make sure students are properly supported. To do this, they may need to:\n\n> 1.         Check that a student’s (NGB) membership is up to date\n\n> 2.         See what training a student has completed or still needs\n\n> 3.         Record progress or sign off lessons\n\n> 4.         Contact a student about their training using their name and email address\n\n> 5.         Have access to a student’s emergency contact details\n\n> Instructors are trusted volunteers in the club and play a key role—especially those who are (NGB) Nationally Qualified Instructors (NQIs). They’re expected to use this information responsibly, just like reading a student’s training record in the club file.\n\n> All data use is logged and should only be for (NGB) training purposes. Any misuse of this information would be taken very seriously.\n\n> However we have taken your comments on board and are looking at options to rectify concerns about instructors access to personal data, albeit lawfully.\n\n> Kind regards\n\n My concerns remain:\n\n* There is an encouragement, not a requirement, for instructors to have a valid DBS certificate.  MY club member is aware of the DBS process as his partner works in the care field, but does not hold a DBS certificate.  Most NGB instructors do not.  \n* Regardless of the advice the NGB has claimed to receive, there has been an unlawful disclosure of personal information of a third party because it was without their consent and there was no lawful need or requirement for my club member to see or use it.  \n* The service remains designed to provide open access to personal information by default, contrary to Article 25 of the 2018 Regulations.  The fact they have restricted my club member's access to his own club, this one time, and following my referral, does not address the systemic design failure in access to records for all NGB instructors, of which there are over 1,000.  \n* The above copy-pasted response (I am aware of a number of other individuals who have raised concerns about their own personal information being shared without without consent) claims that instructors are expected to behave responsibly with personal information, yet no data protection training is provided as part of the NGB instructor training regime.    \n* The issue of a minor's personal contact information being shared without their knowledge with someone who has no need to access it remains unresolved.  \n* The information being held doesn't actually include emergency contact details, which given the extreme sports nature of the organisation, is what would be of most use!\n\nI used to be a senior leader in a voluntary youth organisation which managed all young persons' information via a web service.  There were extremely rigid yet very sensible rules about who had access to what.  This broad level of access to childrens' records would have resulted in the a service shutdown until it was resolved.  \n\nMy question\n\nAm I way off base here?  Is the \"access by default\" for instructors, as big a deal as I think it is?  I am fairly confident a breach is still occurring and whilst I am neither the person in the organisation responsible for reporting, nor the subject of the complaint, I want to be fairly confident in where I stand before I take this to the ICO, as it is definitely going to cause relationship issues between my club and the NGB if I do.

The problem you have is that you sign up and agree to the social media T&C essentially agreeing to them storing your data in whichever data centre they state as well as any other mechanisms. Worth to note, if you read the actual T&C you will see it states they may share your data with appropriate law enforcement authorities if necessary.\n\nNow onto your scenario. \n\nIf you attend a county which has specific entry requirements,GDPR will not protect you. You are entering a county fully aware of all implications and as a condition to entry.\n\nGDPR does NOT override other national or international laws.\n\nIt also is limited to how it applies where YOU choose to go to another country not offering same protection as EU.\n\nThis is the case and always been the case with authoritarian counties and access to them. People are advised to read travel guidance and are specifically informed to the important laws that apply.\n\nFor example, it may be legal to carry and smoke weed in one country but it will be illegal in another. If you travel to country where weed is illegal and then get caught, you cannot say \" I didn't know\" or argue its legal where you came from,thats not how it works.\n\nSame principle with GDPR. \n\nNow,if you really think about it. IF for the arguments sake it would be illegal for US to check your social media content upon entry. Who would be enforcing fines? Which supervisory authority? Now, do you really think any supervisory authority of EU would go and challenge the US political party and their law enforcement? No.as they will be careful to not make the political climate even more turbulent.\n\nFor the arguments sake, they choose to go all out and do challenge said practice under GDPR. It will not go anywhere..it will be a cold war with political implications. \n\n\nIn conclusion, if you choose to go to the US and your social media gets raided that is not against GDPR.

So I tried to remove it.\n\nThere is no button to delete it on the ui so I clicked the tech support chat. First a bot was trying to guide me to some non-existent setting for deleting my account and then a live agent connected.\n\nThe live agent was trying to convince me to keep the account as it's \"free with no extra charges\" while taking 10 minutes between each response. And in the end they told me I have to provide a selfie holding a paper with the current date and the phrase \"I want to delete my Revolut Ramp account\" which to me is absurd.\n\nAfter several refusals for deleting my account without a selfie I asked for their data retention policy where I was assured me that \"they follow strict guidelines through their internal policy about privacy and data retention\" without any link to the exact guidelines. So after 45 minutes of wasted time I closed the chat.\n\nAfter that of course I filled a complaint through their official complaint email where they found no wrong-doing and they will not uphold the complaint as they \"take the security of my account very seriously\" and that's why they need a selfie verification, even though it was never required for a regular account (which I can also delete with a button) or the actual Revolut Ramp.\n\nIs my country's data protection office the next step?

Stripe should only be asking for information they already have on you in order to verify your identity (so you shouldn't be providing them anything \"new\" that they don't already have).  I've worked with a company that interacts with companies like Stripe Identity and there's usually legal safeguards to destroy any information they receive that they didn't already possess.\n\nIdentity verification providers register themselves with different organizations (such as government agencies, or other data brokers) to obtain personal data for specific use cases.\n\nAs for bypassing the Stripe demand, OpenAI will state that they are doing so to comply with the GDPR (with the obligation to verify the data subject's identity), and using a third party to do so in order \\*not\\* to collect personal data that they don't already have.

Another provider I worked with had access to all of the drivers license information from specific US States - someone could upload their license and a photo and they can determine a match within a state's license database.\n\nI am not familiar with how Strip Verification works specifically or the sources of data they have access to to authenticate an individual.

Regulators said: *“Nope, you can’t make rights this hard to use.”*  \n- **OpenAI** is doing something *different-but-similar*: instead of hiding the option, they’re gatekeeping it behind a Stripe ID scan—which feels just as extreme for a non-banking service.  \n\nBut here’s where I get confused:  \n1.

The question is whether they can justify the level of identity verification they are performing to comply with your request to delete your account. I can understand that a certain level of verification is needed for a paid account (and whether someone purchased add-ons, as we're heading into commerce regulations), but with a free account there is a potential argument that the level of verification is unwarranted.\n\nComplexity is a subjective measure.  Many of these identify verification systems automate the process; they take a photo from your webcam directly and all you do is hold up your identification document to it (the benchmark from one of the vendors I had to review specified 30 seconds). As for creating copies, in some industries you are supposed to keep records of what you verified (so if someone accuses an organization for deleting an account or releasing personal data inappropriately, they can say \"we verified the individual and this is what they've verified\") - sometimes the controller is able to determine what that period is with their processor.  If copies are being made and they are not being deleted, they are supposed to tell you why they are doing so (I think in one of your screenshots, Stripe specifies it).\n\nThe standard is \"reasonableness\" for OpenAI to prove that they need to use Stripe and that the information being verified is reasonably necessary (and that standard may not be to yours or my standard - it may be some other standard that a DPA find appropriate).   The only way this gets addressed and a decision is made is a complaint with a DPA, and unfortunately that means it's not going to be a quick answer.  So at a personal level you need to determine whether you should wait for an answer (don't delete the account and not provide Stripe with your personal data); or go ahead and perform verification.\n\nCrappy situation.",

We're unsure whether we should leave the \"**\\[ \\] I want to receive special offers via email**\" checkbox un-ticked, as we were advised when GDPR first came into effect, or whether we can pre-tick it like many other UK-based websites in our industry appear to be doing again in recent times.\n\nMany of our competitors, including large PLC's who (in theory) have much more to lose by getting it wrong, all seem to be pre-checking this box. From the ICO website explanation, this seems to be akin to a \"soft opt-in\".\n\nWhen a user places an order on our website, the following points are true:\n\n* they may or may not be an existing customer (ie this might be their first purchase)\n* they may or may not hold an account with us (we do not require an account sign-up)\n* we only ever market our own products and services from the same website\n* we give the option to opt-out of marketing emails during the checkout process\n* we give the option to opt-out of marketing emails in every communication\n\nSome of the ICO wording makes it unclear whether a new user completing their first purchase is still an \"existing\" customer. The rule appears to differ between \"new\" and \"existing\" customers. In my interpretation of the wording, our website gathering their contact details for the upcoming purchase makes that user an existing customer.\n\nI see Rule #3 on the sidebar - but based on these points above, does our scenario seem like it meets the criteria for a \"soft opt-in\"?\n\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\n",

The [Field Fisher guide](https://www.fieldfisher.com/en/insights/eu-e-marketing-requirements) is really good at explaining which countries have soft-opt in or not.\n\nSpecifically for your question, soft oft-in occurs when a transaction has occurred (such as purchasing a product) and you wish to contact them again.  The ICO specifies the following:\n\n>The rules on electronic mail marketing are in regulation 22. In short, you must not send electronic mail marketing to individuals, unless:\n\n>\\* they have specifically consented to electronic mail from you; or\n\n>\\* they are an existing customer who bought (or negotiated to buy) a similar product or service from you in the past, and you gave them a simple way to opt out both when you first collected their details and in every message you have sent.\n\n>You must not disguise or conceal your identity, and you must provide a valid contact address so they can opt out or unsubscribe.\n\nSo the second bullet above is the soft opt-in, but you need to provide them a way to get out of the marketing.\n\nThe [ICO has another page](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guidance-on-direct-marketing-using-electronic-mail/how-do-we-comply-with-the-rules-on-sending-marketing-by-electronic-mail/#howdoweusesoft) that goes through the five requiremes that need to be achieved to rely on soft opt-in. All five need need to be true to rely on soft opt-in.\n\n1. You obtained the contact details;\n2. In the course of a sale or negotiation of a sale of a product or service;\n3. You are marketing your similar products and services;\n4. You provided an opportunity to refuse or opt-out when you collected the details; and\n5. You give an opportunity to refuse or opt-out in every subsequent communication.",

The hospitals response came provided the same response to me they will not provide the information.\n\nThe Ico then changed the person dealing with my complaint and said he agreed with the hospital and will not agree. When I asked why he stated that they received an email explaining why they cannot provide the information I have asked for. When I asked what does the email state he said that it is conferential. When I asked what regulation or legislation this falls under he said the handbook does not really state all scenarios but that he is happy with the explanation but won’t tell me what that explanation.\n\n\n\n\nSorry for the long post but does anyone have any ideas as I am very confused \n\n\nThanks \nUpdate 1 \n\nI think I need add a bit more clarity to the post considering the replies. Thanks for all. Who responded.  \n\nTo clarify I only asked which medical professionals had accessed my records which economically agreed was reasonable. Ico stated I cannot have the details of the admin staff which I greed. \nThe second part to the complaint was that people who were not my carers accessed my records and the hospital admitted to this but stated it was for legitimate use so it was authorised no explanation as to what that is and Ico do not know either but have accepted it. \n\nThe rejection was not based on what the hospital have stated which is no consent to disclose third party information but from the email sent to the Ico. I understand they will not disclose the contents of the email which is fine but now will they explain what applicable laws have been used to uphold this. The Ico own handbook has a section specifically about caregivers I.e health workers which advises essentially heal workers do not have right to anonymity when it comes to health. \n\nThey have also stated that the medical records and audit logs are not the same and audit logs do not fall under sar so the same principals do not apply. Essentially because they do not consider audit logs as a sar the same balance you would provide in a normal sar would not apply here. They were happy to provide all employee names if have asked for my medical record. Thanks again \n\nUpdate 2 \n\nSo I have complained to the ico asking what other Redditor’s have suggested. They came back and advised that they still agree with the trust. They refused to explain to me what legislation or guidance was used as they have not told me before simply stating that they will not challenge. I also requested a sar on the notes an email. They also stated that there was a call note they they have withheld. They said the following\n\nWe have withheld one call note between ourselves and Manchester University\nNHS Foundation Trust. I can confirm that this information is exempt because of\nthe provisions of paragraph 11 of Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act 2018\n(the DPA).\nThis part of the Act lists the Commissioner as one of the bodies that carries out\nregulatory functions and can refuse an individual access in the event that\ndisclosure would be likely to prejudice those functions.\nThe information you have requested was provided to the Commissioner by the\norganisation that was the subject of your data protection complaint only for the\npurpose of carrying out our investigation. It is our view that providing this\ninformation to you would be likely to prejudice our function as regulator.\nSection 132 of the Act also stresses the confidential nature of the Commissioner’s\nrole. It imposes a criminal liability on our staff not to disclose information relating\nto an identifiable individual or business for the purposes of carrying out our\nregulatory functions, unless we have the lawful authority to do so or it has been\nmade public from another source.\n\n\n\nI am confused they admitted in a seperate email that this call included my personal information but won’t give it to me any ideas? \n\n\nThanks \n",

If not, you should do this too.\n\nIf you don't get anywhere with the above, then you can also make a complaint to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman - for this you need to be referred by an MP (doesn't have to be your MP, but that would normally be the starting point).\n\nIn terms of the GDPR aspects, it's basically impossible to say anything without knowing the details - but it is correct that the right of access is not absolute. \n\nFor example, if the specific identities of people who accessed your record were not germane to the situation, then it might not be reasonable to disclose them. \n\nThe ICO has specific guidance about this in relation to health records, in its guidance for organisations about [SARs which involve other people's personal data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/right-of-access/information-about-other-individuals/): \n\n>**What about health, educational and social work data?**\n\n>If the data subject requests information that is also the personal data of a health worker, an education worker or a social worker, it is reasonable to disclose information about them without their consent, as long as the disclosure meets the appropriate ‘test’.\n\n>For health workers, it meets the ‘health data test’ if:\n\n> \\- a health record contains the information; and\n\n> \\- the third-party individual is a health professional who:\n\n>\\- compiled the record;\n\n>\\- contributed to the record; or\n\n>\\- was involved in the requester’s diagnosis, care or treatment.\n\n>A ‘health record’:\n\n> \\- consists of data concerning health; and\n\n> \\- is made by or on behalf of a health professional (eg a doctor, dentist or nurse) in connection with an individual’s diagnosis, care or treatment.\n\nOn the face of it, it sounds like your request should meet this test.\n\nSo I would ask the ICO to explain, with reference to its own guidance, why it has not upheld your complaint. \n\nNote that the same page does also say this, about whether or not to disclose others' personal data: \n\n>**Circumstances relating to the individual making the request.** The importance of the information to the requester is also a relevant factor. You need to weigh the need to preserve confidentiality for a third party against the requester's right to access information about their life. Therefore, depending on the significance of the information to the requester, it may be appropriate to disclose it even where the third party withholds consent.\n\nI would suggest this could work the other way too. For example, if the hospital - and the ICO - believed your request for details of the individuals who accessed your record was in some way vexatious, they could feel justified in refusing to comply.\n\nBut I think either way, the ICO and the hospital should give you a full, clear explanation.",

Usually they are updated via an online portal but I get an error message each time I try to do it. I contacted them by email over a month ago requesting support but they haven’t replied. I called their helpline and spoke to someone who told me to write a letter containing details of my account as identity verification and request the update in the letter. So I did that, I have proof of delivery. Weeks have passed but they have not updated my details. I spoke to someone again on the phone and they said they have no record of my letter or emails. What can I do? Is this a GDPR violation? Not allowing me to update my personal information? ",

It appears that some sites are now offering users the option to decline cookies, but only if they are willing to pay for it. If you don’t want to pay, you’re left with the choice of accepting cookies, which means your data is shared online—something many of us do reluctantly.\n\nI always thought that under GDPR, people should be able to choose whether to accept cookies without any pressure. But if users have to pay or accept cookies, is their choice really free?\n\nI am just curious to hear what others think.

There have been some recent cases which have legitimised the practice, particularly in Germany including some recent guidance by the DSK. While the EU GDPR, EDPB guidance and supervisory authority decisions are no longer directly impactful on the UK, we’ve not departed enough that the interpretation that “consent or pay” can be lawfully done is out of the question.\n\nI personally believe that the blanket enforcement of accepting all cookies, not just marketing cookies, renders it likely unlawful (because the consent lacks specificity) and the “pay” element they’re looking substitute could not ever be read to include analytics cookies (as analytics cookies do not generate revenue).\n\nThe counter to this in the UK is that the DPDI Bill (No. 2) that was dropped in the wash up of the tories getting the boot was that analytics cookies were set to be allowed to be placed on user devices without consent (using legitimate interest), so this could, in theory, be used as a way to shoehorn ignoring the analytics cookies in the “pay or consent” model because we were set to allow them without consent anyway (but I would still argue until a change to PECR happens that it would remain unlawful to bundle them with marketing cookies).",

                "body": "As far as I see it, there is nothing wrong with monetizing your site and offering content that is only available to subscribers, but that is different to what is happening here - they are asking you to pay for something which is a right, which is your privacy, i.e. not having them pass your own personal information to others. i.e. they first have to determine who you are, or what device you are using to look at their page and possibly also communicate with others as to your web activity, rather than just show you the content of their page, which is what you are expecting. You probably found it via a link somewhere, maybe something you searched for on google.\n\nInternet advertising to some extent is an issue for major discussion, but there is no such thing as personalised ads when I watch TV or read a newspaper. Both of those make money through advertising but everyone who watches the TV channel (at least within my region) or reads that edition of the newspaper is going to see the same ads, so why not on the internet?\n\nThe other thing that is different is that those who pay for the advertising on TV or in a newspaper pay a fixed amount - with TV possibly based on the length of the ad and when it is shown, in a newspaper often based on the size of the ad and what page it appears on. What neither pays for is the result of their advertising - i.e. when I watch TV and an ad-break comes on, if I haven't left the room at the time, it's still highly unlikely I'm immediately going to rush onto amazon and buy the advertised product. So why do they advertise? To let me know it's there so if there comes a time when I need it, I will possibly buy it.\n\nBut internet advertising appears to be different. They expect you to \"click\". The ads are often extremely intrusive and most of the time are served up by 3rd party ad-servers, which of course many of us block, including me. I only block them because they are annoying and intrusive, but another thing: if the content provider simply put something like \"this page is sponsored by ... \" at the top (and I have seen that done) it won't get blocked. I know because I have ad blockers and those are not blocked.\n\nThe other thing is that those who put their content on the web will use 3rd parties to do this, or use such tools that do all the above, and it is not actually the companies themselves who make these choices, at least not deliberately.\n\nThe fact these banners usually start with \"We respect your privacy\" or \"Your privacy matters to us\" when it clearly doesn't, and that they all look the same, to me acts as a clear indicator. This reminds me of when in around 2011 I had a page provided by [webs.com](http://webs.com) that made users fill in an illegible captcha when they logged in. I didn't want it there but had no way to remove it (nor later to start clicking on squares with whatever pictures). Similarly I wouldn't want my users to have to decline cookies, as I wouldn't use any that were not strictly necessary, and if they were just reading \"open\" content that didn't need an account, I wouldn't need to know who they were at all.",

Remember, the mere fact of asking for consent is indicative that what they're doing does not fall under \"necessity for contract\" or \"legitimate interest\".\n\nThe use of the word \"consent\" was a deliberate choice.  It is widely understood that this does not mean mere permission.  Think about what you're saying, and translate it to other contexts.  GDPR creates individual rights.

So far so good. \n\nAfter boarding the train, the conductor (HŽPP) opened an application on his device (phone?) and took 3 actions that looked to me like taking pictures. It was on the bottom right (where the QR code is), the top left (where the date/destination is) and the top right (where my personal information was)\n\nI checked now with ÖBB and this does not seem in line of what they tell me their practice of scanning tickets is - tho they assured me, that they do not take pictures of tickets/personal information. \n\nWhile I believe them (ÖBB staff never did anything that was similar like the actions described above) I do not buy their response of 'it was just a scan' - why would you need to make 3 different scans of information that is already linked via QR-code/ticket number? The screen was visible to me at all times and the 2 other 'scans' (top right/left) were not even containing any QR code so it also wasn't a case of error/device not reading the qr code properly the first time. The app on the phone did also looked to me like a regular phone-camera app. \n\n  \nAm I missing something? This seems like a clear breach of GDPR article 5. Wouldn't be ÖBB (my legal contract partner) also be responsible to make sure the processing of personal information by their data processors is in compliance? ",

In principle that makes sense and aligns with the GDPR. It also leaves the individual who is closest to the data in charge of it and maintains accountability. If as a data owner you've had to plow through (eg) 15 years of data you've decided to keep following a SAR you may rethink your retention practices.\n\nIn practice where this gets tricky is that redactions can be hard with unstructured data (eg a big pile of emails).

The first step of this process after sending in the initial email involves (quoting from the email and the related pages they sent me in response) a \"Cultural Fit scan and the Cognitive ability test\", both of which involve a 3rd party company taking a 20 minute recording of your face with which they \"analyze your behavioral qualities to measure your engagement levels\". One of the images they use is a stock image of a person with some UI overlaid on top that have things like an Engagement graph, \"Blinking detected\", and a counter for \"number of movements during video\".\n\nBasically in simple terms, they're asking people to record themselves for 20 minutes and to then send that video to an unrelated 3rd party in order for them to do some vague and undefined facial scanning in order to proceed in the job application process.\n\nI'm leaving things a bit vague for aforementioned reasons but happy to provide more if I get the green light here, the privacy policy is easily searchable if I include the full text.\n\nI immediately sent the company a GDPR notice to delete my data and withdrew myself from the application, and I sent in a tip to the Dutch DPA about this, but I wanted to ask here: Am I right in thinking this is completely insane for a job application, and bordering on illegal under GDPR?\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Since I've done so in my comments, I am attaching archive links to everything I'm talking about, including privacy policies as they are right now.\n\n- The vendor bunq (whom I applied to) is using and what they want candidates to do: https://web.archive.org/web/20250330160416/https://neurolytics.ai/en/what-to-expect-2/\n- bunq's privacy policy for applicants: https://web.archive.org/web/20250330160732/https://careers.bunq.com/recruitment-privacy-policy\n- The email I got after sending in my application: https://pastebin.com/MuJiiDYz\n- bunq's recruitment steps: https://web.archive.org/web/20250330173210/https://careers.bunq.com/recruitment-journey\n- What I sent to the Dutch DPA: https://pastebin.com/Nkji7Tzn",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI recently came across a (new?) kind of development, and I am confused why there is no more discussion about it:\n\n**Tldr: The emails we write are increasingly read not only by the person we send it to, but also by automation software known as “email parsers” or “email assistants”.  These often share the email content with 3rd party services like OpenAI. Is this ok?**\n\nWhat these tools are supposed to do:  \n\\- extract key information from emails  \n\\- generate responses  \n\\- trigger actions (automations)\n\nWho is in need of such automation are mostly businesses that receive a large volume of customer emails every day and need to process it further. Products on the market are: AirParser, Parsio, Parseur.\n\nBut there is a new trend to push these tools to individual people too! Because .. well automation your private life has become a trend I guess. One example of such product is: shortwave (“Agentic AI for your inbox”)\n\nAnd the internet is full of enthusiastic articles, entries in message boards, YouTube tutorials, on how to build these systems yourself using automation tools like Zapier and GPT. Without *any* mention of privacy or GDPR.\n\nThis development is really shocking to me. It might be making the life of the email ***receiver*** a bit easier. But isn’t that a crazy trust violation for ***the sender*** of an email?\n\n1. When my message is shared with another party, I want to know that BEFORE I send an email, so I can choose to contact the person by other means (or not share some information)\n2. When I send somebody an email, I trust the technology “email” that the only person who reads it is the intended person. That’s why we have end-to-end encryption.\n3. Email is so sensitive, it can contain all kinds of content! I dont want this information be shared with OpenAI.\n\nMy question is: Is that even legal? Am I missing something? Is email not subject to GDPR?\n\nAnyway, thank you in advance for your thoughts!\n\nPS: Email providers such as Gmail had their own AI integration early on, be it classification AI for detecting spam, and later also using generative AI for those “suggested answers”. But at least it was an AI system from Google, not a third party AI system. Which makes it a bit better I guess.\n\nPS: To \"solve\" the consent problem, maybe email addresses must signify by their name that they are attached to some 3rd party processing? hello\\*auto\\*@acme.com ?",

        "selftext": "My org is onboarding a new vetting/screening agent. This company will be our processor, but this post isn't really about them.\n\nThe vetting agent, as part of their service, partner with a company called Konfir. They see themselves as a sub-processor in the structure. This post is definitely about them. \n\nKonfir allow prospective candidates to collate their HMRC, bank statement data into their app/portal, which can then be shared back to the employer (which would be us). This is speed up the process of reference checking; if my org can see the candidate received salary from Company A on these dates, this can effectively provide and instant reference that they worked there. My issue is that Konfir seem to be exhibiting certain behaviours that only a controller could. For example, they appear to be deciding the lawful basis (consent) as well as the retention period for the data. Their privacy notice is here: [https://www.konfir.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://www.konfir.com/legal/privacy-policy)\n\nWhen you use their service, you create an account and then you have to give permission for it to access your bank statements etc. You also have to give permission to share it with the employer.\n\nIt's the 'verification' data that is at question here. You'll notice that they have the wrong lawful basis listed for this; they state this is for the 'performance of a contract', which I don't think is the most appropriate as they don't hold contracts with the individuals, they hold it with our processor. The notice is also a mixture of controller and processor responsibilities.\n\nThe Konfir element of the onboarding is optional too. If candidates don't want to share their data this way, we will still continue to screen them the traditional way by contacting their previous employers for references. Given this is optional, to me this is more of a 'signposting' to another controller. Should you decide to engage with them (which clearly benefits us too) then you will do so using their terms and their purposes etc. From some of the responses I've seen from Konfir, I think they believe that simply because they are being paid to provide this service, this automatically makes them a processor. My argument back to them was that they appear to be deciding the purposes, which likely makes them a separate controller. \n\nSome of their responses do make me question their knowledge; for example, they believe that the vetting agent is the 'controller'. Whilst they will have a contract with the vetting agent, I would have been more confident had they recognised that we are the controller, and the vetting agent the processor. They were also keen to point out that they'd only consider themselves a controller in the scenario where a candidate decides to reuse their verification data with other companies, for future verifications. \n\nThey are very adamant they are a processor, which is making me start to doubt myself a little.

This application will help them \"assess\" their patients using a questionnaire that healthcare professionals will fill in. \n\nIn this questionnaire, some fields ask for personal information, and others for health information about the patient. \n\nSome fields are directly linked to AI (none of the fields contain personal data). It is absolutely essential that healthcare professionals do not enter personal data, or data that could identify a patient, in these fields.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a Danish citizen and I’ve recently had a shocking experience with an MGA-licensed online casino (Scibet.io operated by L.C.S Limited).\n\nOn March 19, they confiscated my balance of €9,810 without warning when I tried to withdraw. They referred vaguely to their terms (T&C 12.10), which mention things like “VPN use”, “forged KYC documents”, “fraud”, and “bonus abuse” – but they gave no specific reason, no evidence, and no communication beyond that.\n\nI have strong evidence disproving all of these claims:\n\n* I never used a VPN (my game sessions are all recorded without any disconnection),\n* I never claimed any bonus,\n* My KYC documents are 100% real and already approved,\n* I have video recordings of all my gameplay and account activity.\n\nSo, I sent a GDPR request on March 20, asking for (with a reminder on April 2):\n\n* All IP logs, session data, internal risk notes,\n* Fraud/risk assessments related to my account,\n* Documentation supporting their reason for confiscating the funds,\n* A full record of account activity,\n* And any automated decision-making (if applicable).\n\n**Their response?** Just my KYC documents (which I already have) and an Excel sheet with deposits, bets, and withdrawals. That's it.  \nWhen I insisted, they replied:\n\n\"We cannot offer any further information beyond what has already been shared.\"\n\nThat’s it.\n\n**My questions are:**\n\n1. **Isn’t this a clear GDPR violation?** Under Article 15, aren’t they obligated to give me the internal data they used to make a decision that affects me?\n2. Can they really refuse to disclose the reason and the supporting data behind confiscating my balance?\n3. What should I do next? I’m already escalating this to the IDPC in Malta and the European Consumer Centre. Should I also contact a lawyer?\n\nThis feels like a massive abuse of power. They’ve stolen my money, won’t explain why, and are now hiding behind GDPR non-compliance. It’s hard to believe this is happening under an EU license.",

As part of this relationship, we engage further sub-processors to provide the service. \n\nOne of those sub-processors provides a platform that we whitelabel and sell on. Therefore they're still a sub-processor but maybe not in the classic sense.\n\nGo back a few weeks and the sub-processor/whitelabel partner makes some changes to their platform. Client approaches us to complain and asks what we're going to do about these changes. I actually agree that they're not useful changes, so promise I'll do my best to reverse them.\n\nFollowing back and forward between us and the sub-processor, they state they will not be rolling back the changes. Fair enough. \n\nHowever, the client is now asking for information on a) all of our sub-processors and b) the sub-processors of our sub-processor in question.\n\nI am obviously happy to provide a), but I cannot find anything as to how far down the chain we go, or indeed who is responsible for b). Do we pass the controller on to the sub-processor and tell them to deal with it direct? Do we take it on ourselves to find out, even though we have no issue with their potential compliance, etc? I've made it clear to the client that we have agreements/DPAs in place with this sub-processor and have no concerns over their compliance, but they will not let it lie.\n\nThe client also seems to have assumed that we're responsible for our sub-processors' actions, which I agree from a data protection perspective, but surely not from anything else (e.g., material changes to their platform).\n\nIt has my mind boggled so feel free to ask for any extra detail that I've forgotten.",

Further, the opinion explains the controller has an obligation to check that all of these can meet GDPR obligations.

The controller must also check for safeguards in the case of onward transfers.  \n\n>31. While this is not explicit in these provisions, the Board considers that for the purpose of Article 28(1) and 28(2) GDPR, controllers should have the information on the identity of all processors, subprocessors etc. readily available at all times so that they can best fulfil their obligations under the provisions mentioned above. Such availability is also necessary so that controllers can collect and assess all of the necessary information to meet the requirements under the GDPR, including so that they can reply to access requests under Article 15 GDPR without undue delay and reacting quickly to data breaches occurring along the processing chain. This would apply regardless of the risk associated with the processing activity. \n\n>32. To this end, the processor should proactively provide to the controller all information on the identity of all processors, sub-processors etc. processing on behalf of the controller, and should keep this information regarding all engaged sub-processors up to date at all times. The controller and processor may include in the contract further details on how and in which format the processor is to provide this information, as the controller may want to request a specific format so that it is easier for the controller to retrieve it and organise it.",

She went off sick suddenly, and handed in her notice while off long term sick. No handover to anyone. I am essentially the only Information Governance staff member in our company currently.\n\nWe received a DSAR from a staff member who had just been made redundant. The request itself was complex - all communications (emails, Teams, documents) containing her name, initials, job title, and 2 work related terms  from 10 specific people from the start of her employment to date of request, as well as other GDPR queries with some that needed details answers and lots of correspondence with other departments. \n\nI had never had any training with DSARs (my job is mostly SARs for medical records which are very straight forward) so, with the support of our external DPO, was essentially making it up as I went along. I received advice on what should be provided, what counts as personal data, etc.\n\n5 people did the searches themselves and provided the requested information to me (however I believe they did not fully understand what I asked of them, as one off handily mentioned for example that he didn't include emails he had sent himself. No idea why). The other 5 we had our IT do the searches and provide them to me, in the form of PST files. \n\nFor this request, I personally sorted **31,000 documents** (mostly emails and Teams messages). There have been discussions with our DPO team with how the IT searches could be done to reduce the number of results, but no-one can seem to agree (e.g. do we just include emails where the requester's name/initials/job title are in the subject and body? do we include emails she was originally sent/she sent?).\n\nWith DPO approval, I applied a 2 month extension as per ICO guidance as the request is very complex. The requester was very unhappy with this. At this point we had also provided her with information from 6 of the 10 people. She complained information was missing, but refused to provide any details on what was missing, who it should be held by etc. She informed us she has put in a complaint to the ICO (I don't think she's aware of the back log - it's been about 2 months and we haven't heard from them). \n\nWe complete her original request - provided her with the data from the 10 people, answered her GDPR queries, and also as due diligence checked that those information was requested from had not deleted anything after the request came in (they had not). We also provided her the email address of our DPO.\n\nNow we are dealing with her complaint of missing info. Our first thought was to ask IT to pull the data from the people who originally provided it themselves to see if anything wasn't provided. This is **1000s** more pieces of information for me to review, without any information on what to look for.\n\nThe requester was IT based, so has asked for a \"rerun\" to be done on a specific system to locate the information she believes is missing. We spoke to our IT provider, who informed us that this was the backup system. It cannot be searched, you can only restore certain dates (or documents if we know the exact details). And, they restore back to where they came from (e.g. people's inboxes). Our DPO team advised that we won't do this as it is excessive, will cause disruption as it will affect people's inboxes, and the requester cannot tell us which methods of searching we need to do.\n\nThe requester has been in contact with our DPO, who has now said we do need to rerun on Cove. The requester has informed the DPO the names of the people she believes information is missing from. She also seems to believe that what is missing, from what I've been informed by our DPO team, is actually **professional** data (such as her being assigned work related tasks). According to our DPO, this could count as personal information due to \"the impact she believes that had on her\". \n\nIt's possible that this professional information was provided to me by those it was requested from/IT but was not provided to the requester as I was told it would not need to be. I believe I am going to be asked to recheck all the information again for these emails/messages - again **several thousands** of documents to recheck.\n\nSo currently I am expected to check several thousands of pieces of information, including thousands I have already reviewed, to provide information that the requester has provided barely any specifics regarding. Furthermore, this is all in relation to an internal complaint that was about the DSAR that I completed in the first place. I've been told this isn't a conflict of interest, but I disagree. I believe it's because there is no-one else in the company who could do it. We have asked our IT provider to do multiple searches of inboxs, Teams, OneDrives etc; each of these cost us money.\n\nI have been dealing with this request since Christmas Eve 2024. The requester has also routinely been passive aggressive or rude to me, in response to basically anything I send her. This has been personally difficult, as I used to work with her and used to like her. \n\nI feel like we sailed passed excessive a long time ago, but this is only the 2nd DSAR I've done and I am learning as I go. Would love to hear some input. Happy to provide more details. ",

Practically speaking legislative time constraints on SARs aren't fit for purpose when it comes to organisations with social care responsibilities - a person may be known from pre-birth, be involved with social care until they're 18 (or in some cases 21) as a child, and then both remain open to Social Care as an adult, and have their own children in the children's social care. The volume of records, reports and assessments which require reviewing and redacting can reach 1000's of pages which just isn't possible in one month. This demand might not be reflective of your own request, but I strongly suspect if it's SC that they'll have a substantial backlog due to this.\n\nYou can complain to your national DP authority, but I know certainly in the UK the ICO are unwilling to take firm action against LAs due to an acknowledgement they are severly underfunded, so the best you'd get is the ICO asking the LA to identify a plan to address their backlog, which won't necessarily help you. Realistically waiting is your only option, or, if there's specific information you're looking for, see if they can expedite a smaller, specific request and not a request for all information they hold.",

If that's the case then I can tell you that it's very likely they're right and it hasn't been assigned to an officer for review/redaction simply because the volume of requests these organisations receive is astronomical. \n\nI worked for a local authority for several years in the information governance team and we would receive between 500-800 requests a year. All of which were related to children's or adult social care. A quick case would be perhaps a few thousand pages, but the majority would be a lot more (sometimes up to 30,000 pages) and would take months upon months to complete.\n\nNow none of that is obviously relevant to you or your wife but I feel it's sometimes useful to give a bit of context in these cases because you're probably wondering what they're doing and if they're just sitting there doing nothing.\n\nMy advice would be to contact their data protection officer (contact details should be available on their website) and ask why it hasn't been assigned and when your wife can expect to receive the information. You can let them know if you intend on complaining to the ICO (regulator for data protection in the UK) and then follow through with that. In most cases, this does prompt organisations to assign the case and get started rather quickly.\n\nUnfortunately this is likely one of those cases where you'll just have to wait. In cases where I know the deadline cannot be met I will often say to those requesting information that I can release it in batches of a few hundred pages here and there to at least give them something to read through. That could be something your wife suggests.",

Preferably, also offering password-less sign-ins such as Passkeys.

What they could try:\n\n* DNS spoofing, potentially denying or redirecting connections. But this will not allow a HTTPS connection to be intercepted. Users can also prevent this by configuring their system to use DNS-over-TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoT/DoH).\n\n* Downgrade attacks, preventing a user from establishing a (modern) HTTPS connection and either forcing them into an old insecure standard, or denying encrypted connections entirely. However, both users and websites can prevent this. Users can configure their browser to always use HTTPS. Websites can enable HSTS, or even HSTS Preload. With HSTS, the website informs the browser that all future connections to the website must use HTTPS. This information can also be added to a public HSTS Preload List which is shipped with every browser, so the browser knows to apply HSTS rules even before the first connection. Every bank should add themselves to the preload list. Websites can – and should – be configured to decline connections with outdated encryption algorithms, even if this means that some very old devices can no longer connect.\n\n* Passively observing metadata. With current HTTPS, the domain name is visible without encryption (but all other parts of HTTP like the URL, headers, content are fully encrypted). IP- and TCP-level metadata like IP addresses is of course also visible.\n\nInternet security has drastically improved with Snowden, Lets Encrypt, TLS 1.3, HSTS, DoH, and so on. There is value in using a VPN especially in such untrusted networks, but there is less value than many VPN ads suggest.",

        "author": "latkde",
        "id": "1ifvwyx",
        "selftext": "It’s been wonderful to see the growth of this community over many years, with so many great posts and so many great responses from helpful community members. But with scale also come challenges. The following updates are intended to keep the community helpful and focused:\n\n* Rules have been clarified around recurring issues (appropriate conduct, advertising, AI-generated content).  \n* Post flairs have been updated to align better with actual posts.  \n* Community members are invited to become moderators.\n\n## New rules (effective 2025-02-02)\n\n1. **Be kind and helpful.** Community members are expected to conduct themselves professionally. Discussion should be constructive and guiding. Personal attacks will not be tolerated.  \n2. **Stay on topic.** The r/gdpr subreddit is about European data protection. This includes relevant EU and UK laws (GDPR, ePrivacy, PECR, …) and matters concerning data protection professionals (e.g. certifications). General privacy topics or other laws are out of scope.  \n3. **No legal advice.** Do not offer or solicit legal advice.  \n4. **No self-promotion or spamming.** This subreddit is meant to be a resource for GDPR-related information. It is not meant to be a new avenue for marketing. Do not promote your products or services through posts, comments, or DMs. Do not post market research surveys.  \n5. **Use high-quality sources.** Posts should link to original sources. Avoid low-quality “blogspam”. Avoid social media and video content. Avoid paywalled (or consent-walled) material.  \n6. **Don’t post AI slop.** This is a place for people interested in data protection to have discussions. Contribute based on your expertise as a human. If we wanted to read an AI answer, we could have asked ChatGPT directly. LLM-generated responses on GDPR questions are often “confidently incorrect”, which is worse than being wrong.  \n7. **Other.** These rules are not exhaustive. Comply with the spirit of the rules, don't lawyer around them. Be a good Redditor, don't act in a manner that most people would perceive as unreasonable.\n\nYou can find background and detailed explanations of these rules in our wiki:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules/)  \n* [https://old.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/gdpr/wiki/rules)\n\nPlease provide feedback on these rules.\n\n* Should some of these rules be relaxed?  \n* Is something missing? Did you recently experience problems on r/gdpr that wouldn’t be prohibited by these rules?  \n* What are your opinions on whether the UK Data Protection Act 2018 should be in scope?\n\n## Post flairs\n\nThere used to be post flairs “Question \\- Data Subject” and “Question \\- Data Controller”. These were rarely used in a helpful manner.\n\nIn their place, you can now use post flairs to indicate the relevant country.\n\nWith that change, the current set of post flairs is:\n\n* **EU 🇪🇺:** for questions and discussions relating primarily to the EU GDPR  \n* **UK 🇬🇧:** for questions and discussions that are UK-specific  \n* **News:** posts about recent developments in the GDPR space, e.g. recent court cases  \n* **Resource**  \n* **Analysis**  \n* **Meta:** for posts about the r/gdpr subreddit, such as this announcement\n\nThis update is only about post flairs. User flairs are planned for some future time.\n\n## Call for moderators\n\nTo help with the growing community, I’d ask for two or three community members to step up as moderators. Moderating r/gdpr is very low-effort most of the time, but there is the occasional post that attracts a wider audience, and I’m not always able to stay on top of the modqueue in a timely manner.\n\nRequirements for new moderators:\n\n* You find a large reserve of kindness and empathy within you.  \n* You have at least basic knowledge of the GDPR.  \n* You intend to participate in r/gdpr as normal and continue to set a good example.  \n* You can spare about 15 minutes per week, ideally from a desktop computer.  \n* You can comply with the [Reddit Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct), which has become a lot more stringent in the wake of the 2023 API protests.\n\nIf you’d like to serve as a ~~community janitor~~ moderator, please send a modmail with subject “moderator application from \\<your\\_username\\>”. I’ll probably already know your name from previous interactions on this subreddit, so not much introduction needed beyond your confirmation that you meet these requirements.\n\n**Edit:** Applications will stay open until at least 2025-02-08 (end of day UTC), so that all potential candidates have time to see this post.\n\n## Call for feedback\n\nPlease feel free to use the comments to discuss the above rule changes, or any other aspect of how r/gdpr is being managed. In particular, I’d like to hear ideas on how we can encourage the posting of more news content, as the subreddit sometimes feels more like a GDPR helpdesk.\n\nPrevious mod post: [r/GDPR will be unavailable starting June 12th due to the Reddit API changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/14763xl/rgdpr_will_be_unavailable_starting_june_12th_due/) \\[2023-06-11\\]",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone! I'm building a SaaS, where I collect user informations like name, email, purchases and more. I do also collect informations on the activity performed with the SaaS. The SaaS goal is to host public websites, and I have a ToS policy in place that specifies that the service is not intended for use cases like:  \n\n* Publishing adult or oscene content\n* Publishing guns related content, violence, harmful messages\n* scams, unauthorized usage of other brands without the appropriate permission, pyramidal schemes\n* etc.\n\nThe list is long, but it's in place to make sure that people understand that they can use the SaaS for:\n\n* Landing pages\n* collect user information through contact forms\n* offering services \n* selling products\n* blogging content\n* general but legitimate usage of a website for a generic use cases of a brand or business intended to provide services\n\nNow, I am the controller for my users data, but I'm also storing users of my users data. It's a multi-tenant platform, so my clients (my users) have their customers (users of my users) that have to be able to log-in, insert order, save content (like preferred articles, wishlist), register and sign up to newsletters, insert shipping informations, process payments, etc.\n\nBasically, we're talking about a very similar product to Shopify, or even Wordpress w/ WooCommerce plugin. The architecture design and technical implementation suggests that the platform is more similar to a very general use case etsy or eBay, or even Amazon. We could say that on my platform, the 'vendor' profile is a website of its own. The customer profile is a just a customer and might exist for a website or more, but without interconnection between the websites.\n\nWell basically my questions are these:\n\n* What should I do, first of all, with my clients data (users registered directly to my platform)? What if they upload content that violates the ToS? \n* What happens if a user wants to delete data that was public? Should I directly delete the data at their wish? Or am I legally able to keep data for a certain period of time, to make sure that in case of legal cases, I'm able to say \"this guy did this and that on my platform, here's the evidence, here's what he uploaded at XYZ in time\". \n* What about content that changed in time? A user creates an illegal websites (how to make drugs at home i.e). After one week he changes it to be a shoes e-commerce. Should I keep copy of different versions of the website during time? What are my actual responsibilities in this case? Am I liable to be the service offer that allowed the customer to upload such content?\n* What about my clients' customers? The clients manage the commerce part by themselves through Stripe, and I'm responsible to keep data like performances of the web store, orders, shipping and so forth. But, this data is now on my systems. Am I a controller for this data too? Should I design the architecture to be customer dependent and offer services explicitly as a processor and provider of services, but delegate data responsibility entirely to my clients? To do this, I guess I should provide them a separated infrastructure that I just 'rent' to them. What if data is on my infrastructure, but I design APIs to allow my clients to edit their 'part of data'?\n\nI know the post is long, and I have MANY MORE questions. One thing sure is I have to get a lawyer ahahah\n\nThanks for the read. Basically, I would like to understand the know-how to be excluded from responsibilities of what my clients post on their website, and be covered in case of illegal activities conducted through my service. \n\nA related scenario is: What prevents Shopify from being guilty of enabling the diffusion of a scam product, or ponzi scheme? What allows social media to be exempt from the guilt of sharing adult content, or violence, or terrorism related content?\n\nI really like this project and in no way I'll ever leave this un-completed. I'm planning to keep it small until it takes off in my local area. I'm not concerned right now of what could happen, since I will meet my clients in person. But I have to be ready to switch to the global scale, where all of a sudden I realized that the true problem is not technical, capital or operational, but it's legal! ",

                "body": "You have asked a lot of questions, most of them not related to GDPR / data protection and more about general hosting provider issues.\n\nFor the GDPR aspect, I think it would be helpful to carefully distinguish where you act as a sole data controller, as a joint controller together with your customers, or as a data processor on behalf of your customers. This makes a tremendous difference with respect to your legal obligations. For example, only data controllers are responsible for handling data subject requests. Data processors have much simpler compliance obligations, but are prohibited from using the data for their own purposes.\n\nMost B2B SaaS will mostly act in a data processor role, though things quickly get complicated when data is shared across customers or if the SaaS provider wants to collect analytics for their own purposes. Here, it doesn't matter what kind of \"architecture\" or \"infrastructure\" you have, but who is *responsible* for the relevant data processing activities.\n\nIn this context, I greatly recommend the in-depth discussion on the concepts of Controller and Processor in the relevant EDPB guidelines (PDF): https://www.edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-072020-concepts-controller-and-processor-gdpr_en",

You will need a authentication process that is suitable for online services.

        "selftext": "Hello there! I have a question regarding the GDPR role of a Microsoft implementation partner. Suppose\nwe purchase a Microsoft Dynamics package. A partner has added their own customization\nlaver to it, but Dynamics itself is obviously hosted within our own tenant. This means that the data is\nstored directly on Microsoft's architecture and terms of usage of PD from MS automatically applies.\n\n\nNow the MS partner states that they are 'the' processor and Microsoft acts as a sub processor in\nall instances. That seems odd to me because every question we ask, they refer us to Microsoft. They also contradict themselves by saying they don't process PD because the data isn't physically stored on their servers.\n\nI think we should look at the specific role the MS support has and the actions they do with our\ndata e.g. Technical support.\nThe partner helps us with serting up dynamics such as roles of employees and after migration they organize our production data untill we do the management internally.\n\nIt seems more logical to me that the partner is a processor, but purely for the actions they do. And not a\nprocessor in general and MS as subprocessor in all instances. After go-live and the transfer of\nmanagement responsibilities, they have merely specific rights to access data for support purposes if necessary.\n\nIt also creates complications because the Microsoft partner is held responsible for ensuring that Microsoft\nimposes the same contractual terms on all of its sub-processors. Yeah, that won't happen since we made our own terms with the partner. ",

                "body": "This is actually an interesting question because of how the agreements are structured. There's basically 2 main ways a customer can procure D365, either through a licensed partner on a CSP agreement, where the partner acts as a reseller of the licenses, or on an EA agreement (enterprise agreement...agreement). In both situations the customer sign an agreement directly with Microsoft, and ontop of that there is a license agreement (and other stuff) that is entered into directly between the customer and Microsoft.\n\nThe partner is in this case not actually delivering D365 to the customer, as that is delivered by Microsoft subject to the license terms and the CSP agreement. The partner is merely facilitating payment in that regard and respect to the EA agreement, the partner is not even doing that.\n\nThe reality here is that Microsoft is the customer's processor with respect to D365. The partner can in this case act as a processor to the customer as well with respect to managed services provided to the custromer. Typically for D365 they include execution of tests (provided you're using unanonymised production data as part of the testing on the sandbox environments), database refreshes from production to sandbox and dev environments as well as execution of any anonymisation scripts in connection with that. It is also not uncommon that the customer requires help to things like payroll, adding new users etc. which is an act of processing.\n\nTypically the MS partner will act on behalf of the customer towards Microsoft utillising the customer's agreement(s) with Microsoft (technically you can request support from Microsoft as a partner, but you really dont want to as they are much faster to reply if you do so in the capacity of the customer). \n\nMicrosoft also includes a DPA in their agreement framework with the customer. The setup you describe where the partner seems to think it is the processor and Microsoft the subprocessor is simply not possible, as that would require a subdpa between the partner and Microsoft. The customer and Microsoft has already agreed on an inter partes arrangement for data processing, and the partner thinking that it is the processor and Microsoft the subprocessor will not change that.\n\nThat being said, there are situations where Microsoft can act as a subprocessor such as if the partner utilises Microsoft as a subcontractor for consultancy services, in which case good luck getting MS to sign on your paperwork.\n\nCustomizations for D365 are all executed on the customer's Microsoft tenant (typically within D365, but there may be outside Azure components as well). Creating and providing these customizations do not constitute an act of processing by itself.\n\nIt becomes absurd when you think about it, as by the very nature of subprocessors they can be switched out. If you removed Microsoft as a subprocessor the partner would not be able to provide the SaaS services (nor does the partner have any legal right to provide D365 services in the first place).\n\nI would honestly be more worried about how all the ISVs (probably) used  as part of the solution are dealt with. \n\ntl;dr:\n\nFor D365: Customer is the controller, Microsoft the processor. Partner may also be a processor.\n\nFor the purpose of selling licenses: Customer is controller, partner is controller and Microsoft is also a controller.",

                "body": "The smaller the company the less educated they are. The same applies to technicians, sales people, HR and pretty much all other internal functions in a company. Smaller companies often do not possess the skillset required to perform very special roles, such as GDPR. It is usually outsourced, and since they are unwilling to pay an attorney to do all their work for them, they often wing it with their limited knowledge of the subject. The bigger the company, the more stuff of theirs is in order (or paid someone to do it for them).\n\nThe GDPR is a highly complex beast. The GDPR also requires an intricate understanding of IT and general concepts of compliance (same concepts of compliance applicable to GxP, ISOs, etc.). Lawyers are notorious for having little to no understanding of the world around them (not as bad as doctors, but we're up there) nor do we possess any other skillset outside of hitting someone in the head with the law. Expensive attorneys (solicitors) in larger firms often acquire a rudenmentary technical understanding of their area of expertise over many years, however only to a certain extent as they fail to fully grasp the technical side of it. \n\nOther compliance areas (GxP, infosec, pick your poison) has been a thing for many years and as such, have a decent pool of experts within the field, so these areas do not suffer the same issues that the GDPR does. If we assume that, say ISO27000 family, has a requirement to perform split legal/technical at maybe 20% legal and 80% technical, GxP would sit a bit higher at 30-40% legal 60-70% technical, GDPR would be around 60-70% legal and 30-40% technical. In the case of ISOs and GxP, it is possible to reasonably quantify the compliance requirements and teach those to techies who can execute. In the case of the GDPR that is like trying to teach HR how to breed and raise unicorns. The GDPR is actually very hard to quantify as our discussion in this thread has shown. Each case is often individual and requires a solid understanding of the foundation of GDPR and an examination of the agreement structure. You cannot teach that to a techie. At the same time the GDPR requires a very deep technical understanding (enough to know which questions to ask your IT department, which is actually substantial), which practically no legals possess. The very few people I have met who have had a decent grasp of this, has been IT people who decided that IT wasn't for them and went into law at a later point in their career, aka. the nerdiest and at the same time most wonderful and smartest people you will ever meet. \n\nThis is made harder by the fact that I have not seen any data protection authority who have released proper guides. The guides they have actually released are single subject deep dives into specific areas and not one long paper on how all this stuff fits together, or how you should actually proceed with getting compliant. You need to stitch it together yourself, which is really not easy. Of course this is not made easier by the fact that some data protection authorities are overzealous and apply a much too strict interpretation of the GDPR, and some have even been drinking the head of the still and invented new things on their own.\n\nAs an example we can look at the requirements for a TIA (transfer impact assessment). You are required to perform a comparative analysis of the designation country's laws and legal system and the GDPR, a very academic discipline, and then combine that with the actual processing taking place in order assess the risk. This is basically impossible for 99%+ of people working with the GDPR to do.\n\nGDPR compliance in companies isn't seen as a particularly important, nor prestigeous, area so it is often, in my experience, assigned to fairly \"fresh\"/inexperienced legal people. This is quite a problem as these legals will never be able to actually perform their role to the required extent, as they will not have the required skillset and knowledge. In my experience I usually encounter young women tasked with GDPR compliance, who have not received enough training to perform the role (then again, who would they receive this training from in the first place...). It is not to sound sexist, but this tells me that the GDPR-problem has been pushed to the youngest and least experienced person in the legal department which sort of observationally validates what I wrote in the beginning of this section.",

Seeing how you are in a large company, I would also hazard a guess and say that they are probably not doing that.

        "selftext": "In a [judgement from 2022-01-20 in case 3 O 17493/20](https://rewis.io/urteile/urteil/lhm-20-01-2022-3-o-1749320/), the *Landgericht München* in Germany found that there is no legitimate interest for using Google Fonts. By extensions, this means any use of CDNs is improper.\n\nCore points from the judgement, translated from German:\n\n* The website was ordered to pay a small compensation of EUR 100 to the data subject and to fulfill an Art 15 data subject access request.\n* Embedding fonts from Google Fonts means transmitting the dynamic IP address of the visitor to Google.\n* The dynamic IP address is personal data. The court summarizes the argument from the *Breyer* judgement, that there are reasonable means to identify the data subject with the help of third parties, namely the competent authority and the ISP. “For this it is sufficient that the defendant has the abstract means for identification of the person behind the IP address. Whether the defendant or Google have the concrete means for linking the IP address with the plaintiff is irrelevant.”\n* There was no legal basis for this disclosure. Clearly, there was no consent. There also was no legitimate interest because “Google Fonts can also be used by the defendant without establishing a connection to Google servers when the page loads”. Presumably, the court suggests that the assets can be self-hosted instead.\n* There is a confusing paragraph about “encrypting” the IP address. Presumably, this means that the data subject does not have an obligation to use VPNs. The argument is that compliance obligations cannot be reversed so that the data subject – who should *benefit* from data protection rights – would be responsible for maintaining their privacy.\n* Transmitting this personal data without legal basis violates the affected person's personality rights. This gives rise to a right of compensation per Art 82 GDPR. In calculating the damages, the court took into account that this was regular and not a one-off disclosure, that Google is known for tracking, that transfers to Google's servers in the US do not have an adequate level of data protection, and that the purposes of these damages is also to deter future infringements. In case of repeat infringement, the website was threatened with a fine of “up to” EUR 250000.\n\nDiscussion of consequences and the wider context:\n\n* Schrems II enforcement has arrived in the mainstream. Unnecessary transfers into the US and to US-based companies are now routinely seen as an aggravating factor.\n* This judgement can be seen in a context of closer scrutiny of web privacy / Schrems II issues by courts and supervisory authorities, such as the Austrian DPA's decision that Google Analytics are not OK ([read article by NOYB](https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-dsb-eu-us-data-transfers-google-analytics-illegal)), or another German court's decision about the use of Akamai by Cookiebot ([read article from IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/new-eu-data-blockage-as-german-court-would-ban-many-cookie-management-providers/)).\n* There is no legitimate interest for using CDNs when the assets could be self-hosted instead. Loading content from third parties should generally be made conditional on valid consent. However, this court's argument does not seem applicable when the CDN acts as a data processor. So this clearly affects public/free CDNs for open-source assets like cdnjs, jsdelivr, Google Fonts, BootstrapCDN and the like, but not necessarily commercial/private offerings like Akamai, Cloudfront, Cloudflare, or Fastly. On the other hand, the Cookiebot case mentioned above does single out transfers to Akamai as illegal, though I'm far less convinced that the argument in the Cookiebot case would withstand an appeal.\n* So far, the damages are largely symbolic. The EUR 100 compensation is small compared to the legal costs both parties will have incurred. But this was a single individual, not a group, and compensation for damages suffered, not an administrative fine. The important aspect is not the amount of the fine, but that non-zero damages were assumed for the mere disclosure of an IP address to Google.",

The user had no control over this, it just happened automatically.\n\nSo a website that uses HTML elements like `<link>`, `<script>`, `<img>`, `<iframe>`, `<audio>`, `<video>`, JavaScript APIs like `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch()`, or CSS features like `@import()` to automatically contact US servers would be questionable. Embedding content from third party servers can be a problem.\n\nIn contrast, merely linking to another page (e.g. `<a>` tag) or loading content once the user gives consent would not seem to be a problem.\n\nUsing ordinary links might be a problem though if the browser performs [preloading/prefetching/prerendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_prefetching). These are still somewhat experimental technologies, and generally require that the website explicitly annotates links that should be prefetched.

Previous decisions effectively become a kind of law.\n\nIn a civil law system, laws are given by the legislator. Courts interpret and apply the law and in doing so can disagree with previous rulings in similar matters. In Germany, courts do cite other decisions, but on roughly equal footing with legal literature like commentaries (or EDPB guidelines!). In practice, courts do align with the interpretation suggested by superior courts. In particular, decisions by the European Court of Justice are so important because they make decisions about the correct interpretation of EU law – the ECJ doesn't concern itself too much with the concrete case at hand. Only constitutional courts participate in the development of law, such as by rejecting a law as unconstitutional.\n\nSo the decision in this case does not bind other courts to decide similarly. But the decision has become part of jurisprudence and might be cited in future decisions by other courts. I think it is a very straightforward case that was resolved in a straightforward manner and will be easy to cite by others. It is difficult to disagree with the decision, and the judgment itself calls this a slam-dunk case (though in polite legalese: the lawsuit is “overwhelmingly justified”). On the other hand it does not decide a particularly novel matter so it isn't very relevant – the case received attention primarily because everyone uses Google Fonts, so there is a large *practical* impact. The same decision could have been made back in 2018, based solely on the *Breyer* case where the ECJ decided that dynamic IP addresses are personal data.\n\nThe only potentially interesting aspect of this judgement is the concrete statement about the lack of a legitimate interest. On the other hand, that is a clear consequence of the *necessity test* required for a legitimate interest.\n\nWhen gusmaru asks if this means “that EU Website Operators are unable to reference or link to anything residing in the US”, the technically correct answer is no – the judgement itself has no *legal* effect on courts or data controllers. But the decision reflects an interpretation of the law that seems reasonable. If someone argues a different interpretation, they should use this judgement to update their interpretation even though it is technically still possible to disagree. So this has the *practical* effect of notifying the web developer community that previous assumptions about CDNs do not hold (and weren't correct in Europe since 2018, if not 1995).",

The defendant could have argued that Google definitely did not have the reasonable means to identify visitors because of some specific factor that distinguishes them from the Breyer scenario, but they didn't.\n\nIn essence, you and the court disagree about the burden of proof for identifiability.

Or, if this phrasing makes you happier, *Breyer* established that such means for identification are reasonably likely to be used. The *Breyer* judgement adopted a position that it is not relevant whether the means are likely to be used in the sense of “with high probability”.\n\n> An IP-address can definitely be personal data at Google due to the massive amount of other data it probably links to, but it seems extremely unlikely that this would be shared with the website.\n\nThis is not the issue at hand. The problem is sharing personal data in the other direction, from the website to Google. If the IP address is personal data, and the website causes the visitor's browser to connect with a Google service that is not bound by a DPA, then the website is responsible for this sharing of personal data with Google. This needs a legal basis, yet none was established. Compare also the *Fashion ID* case regarding responsibility for processing activities in the browser.",

In fact, the LG München cited another judgement from the *Breyer* saga.\n\nBut neither the GDPR nor this judgement forbid processing personal data or IP addresses. Here, the court only ruled against sharing personal data to third parties without a good reason. “But it's a CDN” or “pretty fonts” was not considered to be a good reason by the court, as the fonts could have been self-hosted instead. That is not a reality-defying judgement by the court. I started self-hosting fonts when the GDPR came into force, and guess what, it works.\n\n> What is the solution to this, stop loading third-party assets? stop using third-party calls? create a gateway on each website before entering to warn of external technologies that load the page?\n\nThe solution is to stop loading stuff from random third parties without a good reason. There are three possible approaches to resolve this:\n\n* *stop* loading stuff from third parties\n* stop loading stuff from *random third parties* – sign a Data Processing Agreement with them instead so that they are contractually bound to only use the data as instructed by you, but not for their own purposes.\n* have a good reason\n\nWhich of these three approaches is appropriate depends entirely on context.\n\nAs an example, let's consider embedding a YouTube video. You really want to show that video (solution #1 won't work) and YouTube won't sign a DPA for you (solution #2 won't work). This leaves the third approach: have a very good reason.\n\nIn some cases there might be a contractual necessity for sharing data with a third party (for example, connecting with an OAuth server is strictly necessary when the user selected this authentication option). Sometimes there might be a legitimate interest. But consent always works.\n\nThe common solution – widely used here in Germany since about a decade – is to replace the embedded content with a placeholder. The placeholder briefly explains the risks of loading third party content (data like IP addresses is shared with the third party, and what happens with the data is outside your control). The placeholder asks for consent. Clicking on the placeholder loads the actual content. This way, no communication with the third party occurs until the user gives consent. Of course, the consent status can be remembered in a cookie so that the user only has to be asked the first time. The other content in the site remains accessible without consent.\n\n> GDPR also prohibits not displaying or allowing access to people who don't want to share that information\n\nArt 7(4) says that consent will typically not be freely given if performance of a service is made conditional on unrelated consent. Only loading a video when the user consents to personalized ads → unrelated consent and illegal. Only loading a YouTube video when the user consents to loading content from YouTube → that consent is necessary to perform the service and therefore legal.",

If it were not for the website operator's decision to load assets from Google's servers, the users would not have disclosed this personal data to Google.\n\nThe LG München did not invent this responsibility. It was previously established in the *Fashion ID* case.  A company had inserted Facebook Like buttons on the web page, and argued that it was not responsible for the ensuing disclosure of personal data (such as IP addresses or possible tracking cookies) to Facebook. See, it was the browser and not the website operator that disclosed the data, and the website operator never had access to the data in the browser in the first place!\n\nThe European Court of Justice did not buy this argument. By coding the website in a particular way, the website operator was responsible for causing the user's browser to act in a particular way, so it was the “data controller” for the collection an transmission of personal data by the Facebook Like button, though Facebook is of course jointly responsible for what their code does.\n\nThe underlying argument is that someone is a data controller and thus responsible for GDPR compliance when they determine the “purposes and means” of processing, alone or jointly with others. Embedding the code for the button was an exercise of this power to determine purposes and means. In contrast, the website operator is not a data controller for whatever Facebook does with the collected data on its servers, because it cannot control what FB does.\n\nHaving access to the data is not always necessary in order to be the data controller responsible for the processing. This was decided even earlier in the *Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein* case where the creator of a Facebook page was found to be jointly responsible with Facebook for cookie compliance issues. I think that case was also cited in the *Fashion ID* judgement.\n\nThe given case from Munich is a very straightforward extension from the Fashion ID judgement, though the website operator didn't even claim that they weren't responsible.",

The website owner would already have a valid legitimate interest to process IP addresses to deliver the website itself, I guess.\n\nYes. The problem isn't that IP addresses are a thing. That problem is needlessly sharing personal data with a third party which could then use this data for whatever purposes.\n\n> Is there no requirement to demonstrate the *necessity* to engage a data processor to perform a function in the first place?\n\nThe GDPR does not restrict what activities may be outsourced to processors. Anything is fair game. You don't need a legal basis for using a processor – the processor merely acts on behalf of the data controller, and is contractually bound to only use the data as instructed by the controller. So the processor acts as an extension of the controller, not as an independent controller.\n\nThe limitations to this ability to outsource processing activities are (a) that there must be an enforceable contract that binds the processor per Art 28 GDPR, and (b) that the rules on international transfers must of course be followed, if applicable. This latter constraint makes the use of e.g. US or Australian processors quite questionable.\n\n> Would adding [a CDN acting as data processor] to an existing website not be a violation of the \"necessity\" requirement of art(5)(1)(c) -- given that the existing website must have the capability to serve static files, without involving a third party DPA's servers?\n\nI don't think arguing from the Art 5(1)(c) data minimization principle is a good fit here. It says: given an otherwise legal purpose, you can't process more data than necessary for that purpose. But here, we're processing the same amount of data (the IP address + other traffic data), regardless of how we conduct the processing (self-hosted or third party server).\n\nThe “necessity” can be introduced more clearly through Art 6(1). *All* legal bases other than consent require that the processing is necessary. If I were to pick an Art 5 principle to found this on, I'd pick the Art 5(1)(a) lawfulness principle: personal data shall be “processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject”. The data cannot be used for other purposes per the Art 5(1)(b) purpose limitation principle, unless the new purposes are compatible.\n\nOnce a processing activity is legal, the controller can decide freely how to carry out this processing, taking into account the GDPR's principles and conditions. I don't see any terms that would require or prohibit engaging a CDN as a data processor. In practice, this is often just the choice between two data processors anyway: am I engaging a processor to serve assets from a CDN on my behalf, or am I engaging a processor to provide hosting space or a server on my behalf? The GDPR does not require anyone to maintain their own hardware. At most, there might be interesting interactions via Art 32 GDPR (security of processing), which also involves aspects like availability and resilience of the processing systems. I think it is usually easier to argue that a specialized data processor (such as a cloud provider) is better equipped to help me fulfill such security goals than I am on my own.",

GDPR must allow for the outcome of that evaluation to be negative. This makes the case that an IP-address cannot by default be personal data.\n\nI agree that Recital 26 offers the possibility of reaching a conclusion that a given information is not personal data. But it doesn't follow that we should treat IP addresses as anonymous information by default.\n\nLiability argument:\nAn IP address is either anonymous or personal data. There are no further GDPR restrictions on using anonymous data, but there are regulations about using personal data. Thus, the only compliant approach – if we do not specifically know that the IP addresses are anonymous in this context – is to treat them as personal data by default. But sure, this can be disproven.\n\nLikelihood argument:\nThe ECJ gave us the analysis in the *Breyer* case that\n\n> a dynamic IP address registered by an online media services provider when a person accesses a website that the provider makes accessible to the public constitutes personal data within the meaning of that provision, in relation to that provider, where the latter has the legal means which enable it to identify the data subject with additional data which the internet service provider has about that person.\n\nThis is a conditional statement. But then this decision was given back to the lower court, which in this case was the German BGH. The LG München decision about Google Fonts cites this exact BGH decision. The BGH found that German law does afford such legal means which enable the controller to identify the data subject. So at least in the German context in which the LG München works, the ECJ's finding is effectively unconditional. I would expect the same in all other rule-of-law countries as well.\n\nSo, based on the observation that courts have ruled that the controller will typically have the means of identifying the data subject, it is more likely that a user's IP address will be personal data than that it is truly anonymous.\n\nI'm not saying – and hopefully never have said – that all IP addresses are always personal data. It is straightforward to poke holes into the ECJ/BGH decisions for specific scenarios, for example if the user's ISP is not subject to the controller's jurisdiction and out of reach of mutual assistance treaties, or if the ISP (or VPN provider) doesn't keep relevant logs. On the other hand, the ECJ scenario is not the only mechanism through which the data subject behind an IP address might be identified, and you know my “online identifier” argument that strongly suggests IP addresses to be personal data without specific identifiability analysis.\n\nAll of this liability/likelihood discussion doesn't directly address the burden of proof argument I made. I think the best argument that the burden of proof is solely the controller's is the Art 5(2) accountability principle. Though this might be a circular argument: if the data in question is truly anonymous then the GDPR including Art 5(2) doesn't apply…\n\nOf course, in the present case from the LG München, neither the court nor the plaintiff nor the defendant contested that the IP address of the user was personal data.",

She’s a public employee, has never got into debt (just a mortgage years ago - normally repaid), and has never purchased anything through financing. The credit card itself wasn’t essential, but it would have unlocked significant economic benefits tied to another product offered by the same bank. After a few days, the application was rejected without a clear explanation. They simply provided a summary of the database checks they performed, which showed no negative records.\n\nFinding the rejection unjustified, I decided to dig deeper. On November 12, I sent a certified email (PEC, an official email system used in Italy with legal validity for formal communications) on my mother’s behalf, asking for clarification and invoking GDPR rights. Specifically, I requested:\n\n1.     Information about the logic behind the decision-making process (Article 15);\n\n2.     Clarification on whether the decision was automated (Article 22); and\n\n3.     If it was automated, a manual review of the decision (Article 22, paragraph 3).\n\nI wasn’t expecting them to overturn the rejection and grant the card after my complaint, but I did want a clear and thorough response. \n\nOn November 25, I received a very vague reply stating that the application was denied “to prevent client overindebtedness” and “in adherence to the principles of responsible credit.” That was it. They didn’t address any of my GDPR-related questions—no explanation of their decision-making logic, no mention of whether it was automated, and no clarification about the possibility of manual review.\n\nI immediately replied, highlighting that their response failed to address my GDPR requests and reiterating my three specific questions. Since then, absolute silence. As of today, January 23 (2025), I haven’t received any further response. More than 30 days have passed since my last communication, and they haven’t even mentioned the possibility of an extension, as required by Article 12 of the GDPR.\n\nThis entire situation is incredibly frustrating, mostly as a matter of principle. I understand that granting a credit card is entirely at the bank’s discretion, but it seems absurd for them to ignore legitimate GDPR requests like this.\n\nWhat would be the best course of action here? Should I file a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (Garante in Italy)? Also, the rejection of the credit card indirectly caused my mother financial harm, as she missed out on significant benefits tied to another product. Could this have any weight in the complaint?\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on how to proceed, I’d really appreciate your input. Thanks in advance!",

They have provided a reason for the rejection, albeit one you find unsatisfactory. The fullness of the decision-making algorithm/process will be considered proprietary data, and as such would not be something they'd share outside the organisation. In the UK, credit companies are not required to provide an explanation as to why credit was declined ([source](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/everyday-money/credit/what-to-do-if-you-have-been-refused-a-loan-or-credit-card)), and generally would direct an applicant to a credit referencing agency to view their credit report. If you don't have a copy of this, obtain one, as there may be something on that requires attention which explains the rejection, such as an incorrect or inaccurate record. \n\n2. This was almost certainly an automated decision. It's likely this will already be made available on the lender's website on their Privacy Notice (see [this example](https://www.halifax.co.uk/helpcentre/legal-information/privacy/data-privacy-notice.html) from a UK bank which has a section titled *How we use your personal information to make automated decisions*). If this is the case, the expectation from the lender is likely to be that you should have familiarised yourself with this information prior to applying, not after, and it's very likely you've ticked a box which confirms you've read and understood the conditions of the application.\n\n3. Yes, you should have heard back from them about a review, although if you replied directly to the rejection this may be an email address that isn't monitored.  It may be worth reviewing the materials around the application to see if they provide a more direct route to request review, but failing this it I'd personally forward the initial response to their Data Protection Team/DPO, then report if this isn't acknowledged.\n\n4. I suspect in practice Garante at best would contact the lender to ask them to deal with it - I often find with the UK's ICO that they're not particularly interested in the comparatively small issues, so if you're the only person who has complained about this particular issue with this particular lender I'd anticipate a fairly dismissive response (although obviously I'm not suggesting that's what they *should* do).\n\n4. You've said the rejection caused financial harm, the lender has said the rejection was \"to prevent client overindebtedness\", which in itself would be financial harm. I don't know if Garante would make a deciding call on which of those two outweighs the other, but the lender is likely to be considered the financial expert.",

The employee replied saying that they didn't trust the department head and still wanted my records.\nI know that the department head did not include all emails between us, leaving out those that would show them in a negative light and would proove that they had lied over some (smaller) issues. \nWhat should I do now? Do I have to comply with the request? Can I leave out the same emails? \nThanks in advance. ",

So under our constitution, they have a right to charge for public documents if they are requested, and the broadness of it is incredibly large, just like what personal data is to GDPR. \n\nIn order to win I must argue that the court must set aside the constitution, and prioritize the GDPR, but art 23 of GDPR says that the rights may be restricted if it’s to protect constitutional traditions.\n\nSo I wanted all my documents back in order to go to another doctor in another country. But then they said that I must pay them 30 euro for each appointment I’ve had an x ray, and then I can only receive my data as a CD or USB drive and I must pay for shipping also so around 40 euro each. \n\n\nHowever In the case called the “dental practice decision” there was a national law in germany which conflicted with the GDPR, and it was thrown out based on EU law primacy, however it was only a civil one not a constitutional one, so I’m a bit unsure if I should use it. \n\nNevertheless, if they were to protect the constitution against the GDPR, should I argue a case of “principle of proportionality”. Since these violations have been ongoing for a long time, and that they aren’t suitable or necessary in order to reach an economic equilibrium, as USBs and CDs are inherently more costly than an electronic system like email. \n\nI’m waiting for an answer of this suit from the hospital, they have until the last day of August to answer.\n\nThank y’all for any response or support you can give. \n\n// A guy with only an secondary education that’s 19\n\n",

My manager asked me whether I wanted it to be done as annual leave or sickness and if it went down as sickness I would get that days annual leave back. So due to trusting my manager I said I’ll put it down as sickness and get my leave back. When i returned back to work my manager informed me that she had only just found out in training that if your off on sickness and have annual leave booked in during that sickness that I would not get my annual leave back unless I had an sick note. \nI was quite annoyed and didn’t know if it was correct as previous NHS employment that has never been the case. \nSo I emailed HR for some advice asking if this was correct. HR responded telling me this was correct and sent the policy. \n\nSo I responded back to HR expressing my feelings  and stated if I knew this I would of gone to the doctors and got an sick note even though I didn’t need to as it would of been wasting an appointment. And expressed how as a manager she should have known this and I shouldn’t have had to read the policy as I put my trust in my manager. HR asked me if I felt comfortable talking to my manager about this, even though I stated I’ve spoke about the annual leave. I responded to HR staying no, I don’t feel like I have a good relationship with my manager. Then few days later after having my appraisal my manager said a comment what I said to HR and informed me HR had sent her the emails trails. And I said should they have done that and her response was. ‘Yes ‘ they can. She also stated that I was rude to her the week before but never pulled me, I feel like I wasn’t rude it’s because she talked down to me and due to the way ahead spoke I was very blunt with her when she came in and asked are you alright , which I thought hmm you know something is up with me. I could feel the situation getting heated and uncomfortable and I suffer with mental health and my hands started to shake and I didn’t want to be in the room so I asked if I could be excused as I didn’t feel comfortable. She said yes and said a meeting would take place. There was no empathy from her as she knows what I suffer from didn’t ask me if I was alright or anything and never checked up on me. I spoke to another colleague and she told me she felt the same way and already made a complaint against her. \nI’m trying to find out what this is classed as I’ve submitted a formal complaint to HR about the HR advisors sending her my emails. As this has impacted my mental health and made me go on sick as I don’t trust them or feel comfortable. \n\nI have a meeting with HR about this but need some advice please?\n\nThanks ",

However, there is this element of being reasonable and ultimately if its clear you were ill that should be fine in my view….\n\nAs for the issue with HR, I agree that sending a confidential email without your consent is concerning. While GDPR might not apply here, as it pertains to data protection, they have breached your trust and confidentiality, which is a different matter. Raising a grievance against HR is justified, even if the result is likely just a reprimand.\n\nRegarding your manager’s behaviour, if you feel it was inappropriate, you can raise a grievance there too.

These measures could include for instance: minimizing the processing of personal data. \n\nSo, no the absence of data storage does not infringe the GDPR, on the contrary.

The GDPR provides for an obligation of transparency in Articles 12, 13 and 14.  The information must be complete and accurate. And even if, in your case, there is no data storage, your project involves \"a webcam for real-time data processing\" so in the end, it's still processing. Transparency will help avoid any misunderstanding and establish a relationship of trust with the people concerned.\n\nWe don't know more about your project, but it doesn't seem to raise any issues from what you've told us. Anyway, feel free to ask your teachers for clarification.\n\nHave a nice day.",

Your previous request has no ramification on you making another request for personal data (there are some rules surrounding requests being unfounded or making nusaice requests, but it doesn't sound like you are doing here).\n\nWhat they are proposing to do is providing you a copy of personal data after February 25th, 2021 because they are taking the stance that you are already in possession of the personal data previous to that date.  Under recital 63, if they possess a large amount of data on you, **they are able to request** to reduce the scope; but this is a request as worded in recital 63, not a right so you can refuse the scope reduction.  Note that this could increase the timeframe for a response (e.g. they could say this will take 60 days vs. 30 under EU; or up to 90 if you are in the UK).\n\nRegardless of your objection or non-objection to the completion of your previous requests, if you are adamant for a complete record, respond to them stating you would like your personal data that they are holding from <date x> through to <date y> regardless of any previous request as is your right under Article 15.\n\nThe GDPR does not specifically specify that they need your current address, just that they need to verify your identity.  Depending on the length of time between requests and the type of personal data being processed, requesting information to verify you may be a suitable precaution to take to ensure that you are still in control over the email address that they are communicating with you through.  However if they are not using this personal data as a verification step (did they request it from you previously), you can ask them to specify the law/regulation that requires them to have your current address.",

However, you will have to sign a data processing agreement per Art 28 GDPR. Among other things, this requires getting your customers to sign off on all your sub-processors (e.g. cloud services, SMS gateways).\n\nThe GDPR requires you to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance and security (see in particular Art 24 and Art 32). You have this obligation either directly as a controller, or indirectly via the data processing agreement. What is appropriate depends on context, but medical info is about the most sensitive thing. In turn, that means GDPR would expect particularly strong security measures.\n\nSMS are highly problematic because they are an insecure, unencrypted communication medium. Avoid sending messages that could allow any inferences about the recipient's health status, unless you have obtained the patient's consent for such SMS reminders.\n\nYour SaaS is not alone in this space. For example, Doctolib does broadly similar things, but has also attracted complaints and investigation by data protection authorities for their unclear privacy practices. You should study the criticism around Doctolib both to understand what not to do, and to calibrate what data protection authorities and the general public expect from such services.

I'm like 60% sure this could be based on \"contractual necessity\", since debugging the problem is necessary to perform the contract with the user.\n\nBut! This is probably not a great way to solve the problem, and that has GDPR implications.\n\n* Data minimization and necessity: is this very invasive debugging approach actually *necessary*? Could there be less invasive approaches? Even if the GDPR allows you to do whatever is necessary to achieve a certain *purpose*, it might not allow all *means* to achieve that purpose.\n\n* Technical and organizational measures: giving devs this level of access raises eyebrows, and letting them impersonate users is potentially dangerous. Doesn't the company have policies or actual safeguards against this? GDPR *requires* appropriate security measures, e.g. see Art 24 and 32.\n\nDebugging by using the user's auth token is especially questionable since a similar approach led to the October 2023 Okta breach, which had severe security implications across the industry. I'd strongly recommend against keeping user credentials anywhere other than the auth systems you designed for it. Valid auth tokens are way more security-sensitive than mere user IDs.\n\nUltimately, this is not a clear-cut \"yes or no\" thing. If we're talking about Art 24/32 measures, that requires taking *risks* into account, and that is somewhat subjective. For this risk assessment, the kinds of data accessed by the developer could be a factor, but I think your distinction between non-identifying and non-identifying data is not very important in a GDPR context.\n\nLess invasive means for debugging I can think of:\n\n* tracing events through your logs, likely using some pseudonymous ID for correlation.\n* inviting a user to a video call where they can share their screen and demonstrate the problem. Or maybe they can record a video.\n* if there is a need for impersonation, developing an impersonation feature that clearly distinguishes between the effective user (that is being impersonated and used for permission checks) and the actual user (who can be logged and traced, discouraging abuse).\n* some companies explicitly guarantee that no human will look at any data into the account, unless explicitly invited. This isn't necessarily a GDPR thing, but a trust and abuse-prevention thing.

Developer machines are typically fairly low-security because they tend to install tons of less-trusted software … `npm install $whatever`, `curl https://example.com/totally-legit-software | bash`. On the other hand, devs tend to be somewhat security-aware and might use techniques like password managers and MFA to protect their own accounts, so the servers that run production workloads are likely to remain secure.

Think about yourself and the user's privacy, because nobody else will care about you.  \n\nDisclaimer : while my IT job ofc treats GDPR seriously, it's not even the highest priority because *it's personal data from the gov* and ofc we didn't wait GDPR to ensure our citizens have privacy.  \nI signed a lot of legalese that basically says \"if you ever access personal data without reason, don't even think about your employment but the judge\" so maybe *some* of our safeguards are overkill for a business.  \n\n> since it is the easiest way to debug if you have a token. Ofc the proper way would be to have a production replication of database with replaced sensitive data like names/emails, other data and debug on that  \n\nWhile legal teams would say \"yes do that and for yesterday\", I don't necessarily agree, because some issues may be caused by data only found in production. It *shouldn't* happen in a perfect world in most cases, but it *may* happen so a saner version of impersonate user may be totally be needed at some point as a nuclear option.  \n^(Personal experience : >!I work in gov and once an entire user's capabilities were blocked because the name was somehow breaking XML without triggering any protection. We sent to the higher-ups an official request to simulate a data query of the XXX request for user YYY, as we couldn't make a test without knowing why THAT user broke a software working since 5 years. UTF-16 valid character inserted as invalid UTF-8 into the DB... Never managed to recreate that case in the test environment, probably because it was caused by an oversight in an old version of our software.!<)  \n\nThe ACTUAL way to debug would be to have your OWN auth, proving that the dev accessed the system, with something else granting access to the user's data.  \nYou need *at all points* to prove if the access is done by you, a trusted employee, or by the user himself. Simply copypasting the auth prevents that.  \n\n> But if a company is very small and I am the only developer then the risk of data leaking by this is none.\n\nOutside legal/GDPR issues, as a fellow dev : you ARE at some point going to screw up.  \nYou worked on a production issue, and then did some tests... did you switch to the test account? A senior collegue wasn't sure and was livid. Took him 10 minutes to determine WHAT he did *for sure*.  \nYou may claim on legal documents that you got a perfect training, that you never screwed up, that any reasonable person would assume you will never screw up.  \nThe legal piece of paper won't help you the day you manage 10 critical issues at once and you type on the wrong key. You *will* need safeguards to *know* you didn't mess up.  \n\n> And it probably doesn't make sense to create infrastructure to hide data from myself.  \n\nOOOOOOH yes, it totally is.  \n\"I can't screw up because I built systems that limit my abilities under normal operations\" is a very good way to stay sane.  \n2 days after the incident mentioned above, senior added a feature so that on our production environment HE, PERSONALLY, would have an ugly interface and awful experience each time he wanted to confirm a change.  \nWas it a GDPR requirement? No, and he never messed up.  \nHe did that to be able to sleep well, knowing that there's 0% chance he tested on production. Near-incident once, shame on your process. Near-incident twice, shame on m... oh wait there never was a second one :D  \n(Only issue is that he can't show examples of prod for convenience... but everybody agreed that those examples should be done on test env anyway so anything that made extra-clear that he shouldn't be an \"extra worker on prod\".

Been doing it for 10 years, with this also being my first job after leaving university. Started out with support in GDPR-implementation, and later in everything new technology, GDPR and whatever other legislation would apply. Some contractual work on the side too. Last year, I branched out to some new stuff such as the AI Act. I like the diversity. GDPR is still my first love, but I feel the variety is preventing me from burning out on GDPR.\n\nI love my job. I got an awesome team (we have a team weekend, we go out for drinks sometimes and really connect), business appreciates me, and there's always something new and challenging coming along so I don't get bored. There's definitely still room to grow, both personally and financially so I definitely don't feel like I hit some sort of ceiling.\n\nThis week, I got contacted by a manager from another team wihin the company. He leads the team where the DPO also belongs too, together with people supporting the broader DPO-tasks. DPO is not the hierarchical team lead responsible for HR, that's the manager. They want to appoint me as new DPO, because they feel my skill set would be better fit for the future. They really want me for what I can do and who I am in my job. But it would mean having to leave my team behind.\n\nWhile I feel absolutely flattered they consider me as the prime candidate for the future, i'm torn between my head and my gut feeling.\n\n* my head tells me to accept it for the opportunity it is, and it can give me a fresh perspective + extra weight within the company due to the formal title. In the long run, there's the possibility for higher financial ceiling than where I am now. I will still be able to advice (probably together with whoever succeeds me, as I am now cooperating a lot with the existing DPO). A person in HR also warned me that staying too long in my job may make me seem \"inflexible\", adn this is an opportunity to grow/learn while staying around things I like namely data and technology.\n* My gut tells me to not change a winning team. I like where I am now, I like the variety. My gut tells me to be afraid to go back to full time GDPR, in addition to the more formal tasks a DPO has to perform (although there is a team to assist). The other team is also not as tight, everyone is just doing their job and going home and I' mafraid to lose the social connection; \n\nDoes anyone here ever been stuck in a same situation? have you ever been hesistant to accept the formal DPO-job? Anyone have any good points for me to make a decision? I feel really torn right now.\n\nThanks a lot!",

I therefore used a text comparison tool to see what changed. Below, I summarize the impact, and do a detailed walk-through of all material changes.\n\nThe good: small improvements, less location tracking\n\nThe bad: web3\n\n# Summary\n\nThe policy retains is structure and overall content. The new version tends to be more actionable and makes it a bit easier to control privacy settings.\nI think these changes are generally an improvement (both in content and form), and suggest a maturing compliance culture at Reddit.\n\nA lot of the changes seem to be overdue cleanup, e.g. removing mention of Privacy Shield, and slightly reducing EEA-specific language. Some ad-related parts have been clarified, but without material changes. On mobile, opt-out from personalized ads is now clearly the responsibility of the app,\nnot of the operating system.\n\nNew categories of data collected:\n\n* optional account info, e.g. interests, gender, age, location\n* if doing blockchain/Web3 stuff with Reddit, blockchain addresses\n\nRemoved categories of data:\n\n* stopped collecting precise mobile device location (previously on opt-in basis, still collects IP-based location)\n* removed mention of Apple TrueDepth camera (???)\n\nReddit adds that account deletion may take 90 days to complete.\n\nInterestingly, the policy still doesn't consider the UK GDPR.\n\n# Details\n\n## Preamble\n\nThe preamble removes a mention of Reddit Gifts, and adds a high-level summary to reassure users.\n\nOld:\n\n> We want you to understand how and why Reddit, Inc.

Now talks generically about “audio and videos”.\n\n### Transactional information\n\nLists information that is collected if you purchase products or services.\nNew additions:\n\n> phone number\n\n> Reddit may collect public blockchain addresses, such as when you purchase an NFT or when a Reddit Vault is created.\n\n> Reddit […] does not store Reddit Vault private key information.\n\n### Information collected from cookies and similar technologies\n\nThis inserts two new purposes (highlighted in bold):\n\n> We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to **deliver and maintain our services and our site,** improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, **measure the effectiveness of advertising,** and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. See our Cookie Notice for more information about how Reddit uses cookies. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see \"Your Choices\" below.\n\n### Location information\n\nRemoves collection of accurate location on mobile devices, leaving only IP geolocation.\n\n> We may receive and process information about your location. ~~For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth).~~ We may ~~also~~ receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive ~~your~~ **an** approximate location ~~from other information about you, including~~ **based on** your IP address.\n\n### Other Information\n\nRemoved entire section. Old version:\n\n> We may also use information from Apple's TrueDepth camera to provide enhanced functionality in the Reddit app camera if you choose to use it. Information from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time -- we don't store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.\n\n### Information Collected from Other Sources\n\nSmall changes in phrasing how data sources are combined. Now directly explains how to configure this:\n\n> You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by visiting the Safety & Privacy section of the User Settings menu in your account, as described in the section titled \"Your Rights and Choices\" below.\n\n### Audience measurement\n\nRemoved explicit names of companies, and now characterizes them as “service providers”:\n\n> We partner with ~~audience measurement companies (including Quantcast and Nielsen)~~ **service providers that perform audience measurement** to learn demographic information about the population that uses Reddit.\n\n## How we use this information\n\nThe items were re-ordered. Two items were changed, separating ad-related purposes from normal processing:\n\nOld:\n\n> Measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services; and\n>\n> Personalize the Services, and provide and optimize advertisements, content, and features that match user profiles or interests.\n\nNew:\n\n> Personalize services, content, and features that match your activities, preferences, and settings. […]\n>\n> Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services;\n\n## Your Rights and Choices\n\nThis merges the previous sections “Your Choices” and “Your Rights”.\n\nThe preamble now mentions that Reddit distinguishes rights based on user location, and no longer mentions that an account may be a prerequisite for exercising these choices.\n\nOld:\n\n> You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Some of these choices are available to everyone who uses Reddit, while others only apply if you have a Reddit account.\n\nNew:\n\n> You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Depending on where you live, you may also have the right to request access to or ability to port, deletion/erasure of, or correction/rectification of, your personal information, to opt out of certain advertising practices, or to withdraw consent for processing where you have previously provided consent. Below we explain how to exercise each of these rights. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws.\n\n### Accessing and Changing Your Information\n\nsmall change in phrasing.\n\n> You can access **your information** and change **or correct** certain information through the Services.\n\n### Deleting Your Account\n\nNew version mentions how long deletion takes:\n\n> After you submit a request to delete your account, it may take up to 90 days for our purge script to complete deletion.\n\n### Opt Out of Targeted Advertising\n\nThis new section was moved out of “Controlling Advertising and Analytics”.\nThe new version no longer defers to privacy settings of mobile operating systems.\n\nOld:\n\n> We also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences your account settings in the Reddit app, or here if you use Reddit in a web browser. You can also use device-level settings to control personalized advertisements on Android (\"Reset advertising ID\" and \"Opt out of Ads Personalization\") and iOS (\"Limit Ad Tracking\") devices.\n\nNew:\n\n> You may opt out of us using information we collect from third parties, including advertising partners, to personalize the ads you see on Reddit. To do so, visit the Safety & Privacy section of the User Settings in your account here, if using desktop, and in your Account Settings if using the Reddit mobile app.\n\n### Controlling Location Information\n\nIn line to the changes with how location data is collected,\nthe following sentence was removed:\n\n> If you initially consent to our collection of more precise location information from your device, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.\n\n### Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests\n\nThis section no longer has a heading.\nRequests are no longer scoped to just GDPR and CCPA.\nMention of requests via authorized agents are moved to the CCPA section.\n\n> ~~Requests for a copy of the information Reddit has about your account--including EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") data subject access requests and California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") consumer information requests--can be submitted following the process described here.~~\n>\n> ~~All other data subject and consumer requests under data protection laws should be sent via email to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your Reddit account. Other inquiries related to your privacy rights can be submitted here.~~\n>\n> **If you have questions or are not able to submit a request to exercise your rights using the mechanisms above, you may also email us at to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your Reddit account, or submit them here.**\n>\n> Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified email address associated with your Reddit account.\n> **If we deny your request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us at redditdatarequests@reddit.com.**\n> ~~You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information.~~\n\n### International Data Transfers\n\nThe section was moved until after the EEA Users section.\n\nDrops the explicit mention of “Reddit, Inc.” as the target of data transfers.\n\nRemoves Privacy Shield explanation.\n\n### Additional Information for California Users\n\nChanged introduction paragraph slightly, but not materially.\n\nUpdates the referenced law:\n\n> The California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), **as amended,**\n\nAdds a category of data collected:\n\n> Your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail).\n\nUpdates the description of CCPA data subject rights. Moves and expands the explanation of requests via authorized agents.\nI won't show the full changes here.\n\nInteresting addition: Reddit now explicitly says it doesn't sell data:\n\n> Reddit does not \"sell\" or \"share\" personal information as those terms are defined under the CCPA. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information except to provide you the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA.\n\n### Children\n\nChanges the definition of children to work outside of Europe:\n\n> Additionally, if you are ~~in the EEA,~~ **located outside the United States,** […]\n\n### Changes to This Policy\n\nRemoved unrealistic requirement on users:\n\n> We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy\n> ~~whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us~~\n> **regularly** […]\n\n### Contact Us\n\nAdded an electronic contact method.\n\nReddit changed its Irish address.",

For example, people can surveil their own front garden. But for surveilling public areas, the GDPR would apply, requiring a legal basis (such as a legitimate interest), and appropriate signage to inform the affected people. Even if CCTV recordings were originally made for purely personal purposes, the act of sharing the recordings with third parties could bring it into scope of the GDPR. That doesn't mean it's illegal, it just means some rules apply.\n\nIf GDPR applies, you would have data subject rights, such as the Art 13 right to be informed, the Art 15 right to access recordings of you, or the Art 17 right to get recordings of you deleted. But some of these rights have conditions. You also have the right to complain to the data protection authority in your country.\n\nIf you believe that the surveillance has violated the GDPR, the practical step is to talk with the person operating the cameras: what area are they surveilling and why? Compare also the right to be informed. The GDPR provides two independent remedies for violatons: suing the data controller in court (for compliance, and for compensation of damages suffered), or lodging a complaint with your data protection authority. Recent EU cases confirm that the DPA is *required* to investigate all complaints, but it might take a very long time and might not be as thorough as you want.\n\nThe UK is a bit more relaxed about CCTV surveillance, and purely personal surveillance might still be OK even if it covers public areas incidentally. The [UK ICO has a page on domestic CCTV systems](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/domestic-cctv-systems/), but it can be summarized as \"don't bother us, we won't do anything, so sort it our yourself\".

A pepper is for an entire database and stored client-side (not very useful, unless your database got exposed and the hacker gets hashes+salt but has *absolutely no idea* what was accessing that database)  \nSo that's like a non-secret pepper which is shared with 5 third-parties. It doesn't really defeat the pepper as a 6th party couldn't rainbow the stolen data base, but it increased the surface of attack.  \n\n2) Given that the pepper is not a secret, from the POV of your trusted third-parties it's simply hashing the email. It protects against exposed databases, but it doesn't provide any meaningful protection besides that.  \n\nSo you have two protections :  \n- You can't know a specific email under normal operations (hashing)\n- Simply dumping the database doesn't allow to break the protection by running some offline task, unless you know what that database is used for (pepper)  \n\n- If you *do* have the info, then the entire database's IS VULNERABLE and can be broken at a speed equivalent to one record (no salt!), instead of requiring more time for each extra record to break",

Unless you set up some weird joint controller situation, but still.\n\nBluntly, you look like you're randomly encrypting things to sidestep gdpr protections.  If that's the game, none of this helps.",

And does \"storing\" requested *partial personal data* in not-designed-for-GDPR forms would count as a potential violation?  \nI think I witnessed an obvious GDPR issue but it's so weird I'm not sure.  \n\nI went in a restaurant where they have an automated order system, and for inside orders you are meant to take some wireless gadget next to the terminal, and enter on the screen the 3 numbers id on it. So far, so good... until the gadgets were removed. (They probably broke or were stolen?)  \n\nBut how do you handle the \"enter a number\" step when you have nothing with numbers? I would've printed bogus numbers on piece of papers and ask people to grab one. You know, like manual waiting lines. Their solution...  \nAdd a sign on the wall \"WHEN PROMPTED FOR A NUMBER, ENTER THE LAST 3 DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER\", plus on the terminal some postit \"remember to use YOUR PHONE NUMBER! DON'T use things like 001, 666, 123, etc.\"  \n\nSo now, the last digits of the phone number are stored as if they were company-issued IDs.  \nUsually, when I see GDPR issues it is because the company actually harvest personal data, or it is the user fault because they put *personal data* in fields where the company asks to NOT put them in there (like phone numbers in game's chat) so there's no sane way to remove the data, but I think it is the first time ever I see an employee asking to use partial *personal data* in a system absolutely not designed for it. It's clear they simply needed a unique 3digits... and their workaround doesn't EVEN provide that. It is wrong on basically all levels.  \n\nI didn't want to make a fuss physically because I don't expect a random fastfood cook to know about GDPR, but if I have a chance to go back there, I'll take pictures if I should do a proper report. But I did revert the numbers just in case.  \n(But it brings an interesting question : who do you report a GDPR violation to, when the violation is done by an anonymous employee bypassing an usually automated procedure? Do we consider the company responsible because it is their building?)  \n\ntldr; Restaurant ask for a company-issued device ID. Devices are gone so some maintainer asks customers to input part of their phone number to use as a unique(?) order id instead as a totally unnecessary workaround",

Just three digits are fairly short, and the restaurant will not generally be able to use this info for nefarious purposes. In particular, the ID is to short to track customers across multiple visits.\n\nHowever, I think it's a suboptimal system on purely practical grounds. The purpose of this ID is to have a temporarily unique order→customer mapping. \n\n* If the restaurant manages the IDs (for example by providing these electronic gadgets, dispensing paper queue tickets, or handing out laminated cards), then it can guarantee uniqueness at any point in time.\n* But here the numbers are determined by the customers and are effectively random, creating the possibility of duplicates. Three digits allow only 1000 different numbers, and if there are 10 pending orders that's already a roughly 1 in 20 chance for two customers to accidentally have the same ID (known in statistics as a \"birthday collision\").\n\nAlso, I wouldn't be able to remember/recognize the last couple of digits of my phone number.

My questions are about your process for when I do submit a request.  \n>  \n>Thank you in advance for your answers to these questions. If there is a better contact for processing GDPR requests regarding \\[DOMAIN\\], I kindly ask that you forward my request to them.  \n>  \n>I look forward to your reply without undue delay and at most within one month of this email, as required by Article 12 of GDPR.  \n>  \n>Sincerely,\\[REDACTED\\]\n\nIf you received this email, don't panic, as I will walk you through the reasons why you should ignore this email in particular. Furthermore, in the end, I'll give some advice on how to spot malicious intend based on technical analysis and a few reasons why these are sent out.\n\nFirst up, the email this was sent from is faked as it has a manipulated header. It likely exists to retrieve responses, but looking at the email's source, which you always should do, reveals a different origin mail address—the first red flag.\n\nSecondly, the email was relayed through Amazon's Simple Email Service and seemingly originates from one of Amazon's data centers (US-West-1). I am always troubled about traffic and requests originating from data centers, as only a minority of people use their company's network to access the internet hosted in data centers. The vast majority are automated scripts used to harvest data, spam, or engage in malicious activities—second red flag.\n\nFinally, hundreds of businesses and organizations received the same email in a short amount of time—which classifies it as spam already, but with intent. Scroll past the CCPA email if you are interested in its purposes.\n\nThe second email pertaining the CCPA containing redacted elements:\n\n>To Whom It May Concern:  \n>  \n>My name is \\[REDACTED\\], and I am a resident of Norfolk, Virginia. I have a few questions about your process for responding to California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) data access requests:  \n>  \n>Would you process a CCPA data access request from me even though I am not a resident of California?  \n>  \n>Do you process CCPA data access requests via email, a website, or telephone? If via a website, what is the URL I should go to?  \n>  \n>What personal information do I have to submit for you to verify and process a CCPA data access request?  \n>  \n>What information do you provide in response to a CCPA data access request?  \n>  \n>To be clear, I am not submitting a data access request at this time. My questions are about your process for when I do submit a request.  \n>  \n>Thank you in advance for your answers to these questions. If there is a better contact for processing CCPA requests regarding \\[DOMAIN\\], I kindly ask that you forward my request to them.  \n>  \n>I look forward to your reply without undue delay and at most within 45 days of this email, as required by Section 1798.130 of the California Civil Code.  \n>  \n>Sincerely,\\[REDACTED\\]\n\nAs you might have picked up, it's the same email word for word, except for its legal basis. BUT, the technical details have changed a little.\n\nFirst up, manipulated header again. Secondly, it's relayed yet again originating from another data center that I cannot pinpoint exactly. HOWEVER, more importantly, is the fact that the TLD (top-level domain) used is flagged as suspicious. Furthermore, it was used eight months ago for the same purpose, sending out the same email except pertaining to the GDPR and not the CCPA.\n\nAnother important information is that this email doesn't contain a tracking method anymore as its last email from eight months ago did. Back then, the email had a white image of 1x1 pixels residing on a server that would log the image request upon opening the email—usually saving an IP address, the machine's operating software, and user agent containing your browser's versions, upon other things. It really comes down to how the server logging is configured. Very good to retrieve data from somebody without them knowing. But let us conclude.\n\n**So what is going on here? What is the possible intend, and what are the ramifications?**\n\nFrom what I can gather, this is intended to collect several different kinds of information. First up, the most obvious is about a company's or organization's method of responding to said email. The entity behind it all can then proceed to utilize the response to\n\n1. offer a technical solution to the perceived hardships of the company/organization in question. Effectively a marketing stunt and sales pitch, or\n2. take legal actions against said company/organization. (Unlikely).\n\nSecondly, and more problematic, it can be used to contact a company's or organization's data controller to gather further information about said individual. Hacking attempts, especially successful ones, are much more social engineering-related than in the past.\n\nThirdly, the most problematic one is probably revealing a company's or organization's mailing server upon replying. If the mailing server isn't behind a proxy, the mailing server's IP is leaked, making it a worthwhile target as it usually contains MORE emails that can be used for malicious intent.\n\nAnd although the emails don't contain a tracking method this time around, let me quickly touch on how that works, even if the mailing server would be behind a proxy. Depending on how the mailing server's software works, the email interface is either rendered on the backend (server) or frontend (user), meaning that either the server itself or the user requests said image and leaks their respective data, such as the IP and more. Of course, the server can mitigate this by utilizing a correctly setup proxy. Even if someone doesn't respond to this email in particular, the email's sender will retrieve data without any consent.\n\nThis makes me believe that this isn't a genuine request but a malicious phishing attempt to gather data. Which in particular, I do not know, but since the attempt is repeated, I would assume that the first scheme worked out perfectly and retrieved enough data to utilize this a second time.\n\nWhen it comes to ramifications about not responding within its given time frame, my gut feeling, although a delicate matter, tells me that nothing will come of it, except IF you choose to respond.\n\nBut what do you think about it all?\n\n**TLDR: it's a scam! Ensure your email server utilizes a proxy to protect it and work with server-sided rendering for your email server behind said proxy to protect your staff.**",

I use a payment service that sends me email addresses for people that have paid me. They have consented to use THAT service, but not mine (actually, maybe they have, see my edit below). Am I okay to store a hashed version of their email even without this explicit consent? Would it be enough for me to put a blurb on my creator page saying that paying me implies consent to this? Edit: Ko-fi is the service I'm using, and they have [this section](https://more.ko-fi.com/privacy#:~:text=Disclosing%20supporter%20information%20to%20creators) in their privacy page.\n2. I only store two pieces of identifiable information: an email address, a unique hash representing their device (computer) that I call their hardwareId. My plan is to store both of these values hashed from their original, which I think is pseudonymisation of that data, because I can no longer retrieve the original, but if they give me their email address again, for example, I can pull up records linked to it from its hash. Is that protection enough?\n3. I plan on storing data from #2 on an AWS server in us-west-1 (California), which seems to meet the GDPR requirement that data is stored in a jurisdiction with similar data protection laws. Will this be okay?\n4. Before a device sends its hardwareId to my service, they would see a dialog telling them that they're about to send that info and linking to a privacy page that goes over Article 13 stuff. Is it enough for me to do that and provide a \"consent\" checkbox? I would also do this in an email that gets sent to them upon receipt of payment.\n5. I plan on sending an email to them before I hash their email address and toss out the plaintext original. Theoretically this email traffic could be sniffed out on the internet and link their email to a unique token I generate since email isn't secure. Anything I should be doing here?\n6. If someone wants me to delete their data, I would just request that they send me an email. Do I need to give them a self-service way of doing this?\n7. My system gives people \"trial\" access to features based on the above data. If they ask me to delete their data, and I'm linking their hashed deviceId to that trial, that seems like a loophole to allowing unlimited trial access. Is there any way I can prevent this?",

Using a unique hardware ID from their device is the only legitimate way for me to tie their usage of features to whether those features should be granted based on their payments. \n\nI also think it meets the \"in ways they would reasonably expect\" criteria: a person using my software for the first time and being granted \"trial\" access to a feature wouldn't be surprised that I'm tracking an identifier from the device they used.\n\nI won't be using either of these pieces of data to market or sell, their usage falls strictly within what I think is reasonable. In this case, I think I should still be linking to a privacy page with Article 13 compliant information, but should I also be showing a popup dialog in my software that asks specifically for consent as well? I'm leaning towards \"no.\"",

[...] Is that protection enough?\n\nDepends if you need that data to provide your service/product or not.

This is commendable but you might not need to and it might confuse your user more than anything, as they are not used to seeing such a message (even if they already use services processing the same kind of data, because of what I just explained about privacy policies).\n\n> 5.\n\nDon't sweat it, here again you are doing way more than you legally have to and it might confuse your users except maybe if they work in IT.\n\n> 6.\n\nNo, as long as you provide a way that is free and you don't put stuff in place to make it hard to do (to dissuade them).\n\n> 7.\n\nThe right to erasure is not absolute. It seems reasonable that you keep the data you strictly need to enforce your trial access. You are already following data minimization by hashing said data. I guess you could also delete that trial related data after a while if these users have not bought your services, let's say after 1 or 2 years of inactivity.\n\nYou are approaching all of this with a lot of professionalism, best wishes to your business.",

If you ask them to delete all your info but you aren’t willing to close your checking account, they actually have to keep some (but not necessarily all) of your data to keep providing you the service you are paying for. Also, your country probably has financial regulations which require banks to retain certain records. Those laws take precedence over GDPR. \n\nStill, if you never wanted the account in the first place, that complicates things. \n\nMy guess is somewhere in the fine print from HP or Microsoft is something that (at least in their view) means you consented to creating the McAfee account. Under GDPR, consent is supposed to be explicit and freely given. Sounds like McAfee hasn’t met that bar, at least to my non-lawyer ears. \n\nThe question then becomes:  Is this worth your trouble? Only you can answer that. \n\nOne option is to send them a nastygram about GDPR compliance and make a report to your country’s Data Protection Authority. Another option is to follow their annoying instructions to delete your account. That might be the quickest, easiest path for you. \n\nAs much as I’d personally like to see McAfee get hammered, going that route might not be worth your time.",

Hopefully, postie and their mates aren't having a good gossip, I very much doubt they are but that's hardly the point.\n\nMy understanding is that a personal data breach has not occurred however to me, this is just plain wrong as I believe the information, if not personal, is still sensitive. The issue has got me wondering what the law actually says, if anything, concerning this kind of thing.\n\nI've sent feedback to NHS Lothian saying that I am both concerned and frustrated as this is an issue that could have very possibly happened to other patients and also one that could have very easily been prevented at source and have suggested that they may simply be able to adjust the layout of letters in order to avoid such information being visible through the envelope window.\n\nAlso, feel free to sense-check me and/or tell me if I am being an entitled/precious a\\*\\* and making a big deal about something that is, arguably, fairly inconsequential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: NHS letter shows 'Department of Adult Mental Health' (sender) in the envelope window.

I only realised this when the CEO of the company called me absolutely livid but by then it was too late to recall. \n\nI have a meeting next week with the CEO, I suspect my secondment will be terminated.

These kinds of mistakes are pretty common and anything but an unforeseeable risk.\n\nSo to me it seems like that either this is not a big deal, or the company you work with/for has a horrendous way of dealing with mistakes.\n\nFor the ICO to act against you personally, you'd personally have to have been the data controller or a data processor (and that means you'd have made an agreement in that regard). It sounds like you probably weren't. And even if you were, unless the circumstances are truly extraordinary, it's very unlikely the ICO will fine you.",

Also when asked she specifically denied getting the information from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nThe next day she backtracked, claiming that she got it from the ministry legally, like any candidate has the right to do. (Candidates can get an electoral roll copy containing only names and where everyone votes, not emails or other information). The ministry denied this saying they never shared information as it would be illegal.\n\nNow the \"greek ICO\" has launched an investigation but I wanted to know if there is any jurisdiction under UK law as a UK resident (me) was the victim.\nThe reason is that the justice system is not... the most effective when dealing with government politicians and she would never face any repercussions from greek courts.\n\nMy thoughts were to initially send a Subject Access Request asking where she got the information from, what exactly information she has etc, and then report to the ICO as a data violation.\nI don't know if the ICO can do anything about it or just forward it to the greek authorities, but again, greek courts regularly let much worse actions go unpunished.\n\nIf the UK law doesn't apply, my other hope would be the equivalent European organisation (EDPS) as she is probably living in Brussels and not Greece.\n\nThanks in advance!",

If this is a regular occurrence, I'd write a mildly polite piss off response, run it by an attorney, and have that be a standard templated response.  From what I've seen, DPAs are all overloaded and reasonable responses like this are almost never in the line of fire.  I also would, frankly, prevent your front-line CS agents from freelancing any of this.  A cs agent freelancing is, ime, far higher risk.  As /u/gusmaru says, you want written procedures on these and you ideally want to periodically audit responses against those procedures.  (obviously, paper that as well.  eg 1x quarter you randomly run 3-5 privacy request responses pulled from your tracking logs past your privacy attorney.)\n\nOne thing I've seen work well is the second someone in the CS flows says GDPR or privacy, the request gets shunted off to a dedicated agent (or handful of them) with specific training on the procedures for servicing these requests.\n\n> I'm currently developing features for the site which will allow people to self-serve their account erasure and data access requests in an effort to reduce the burden on our customer support team and ensure our users don't need to wait for a manual response to their email for any undue amount of time\n\nI wouldn't do that.  Access requests, maybe.  But self-serve deletion makes me say hmm.  In particular, the 30 day delay to service a deletion request (or even an access request) is often helpful to the requester.  It prevents someone who temporarily loses control of their email from a serious mess, either with high speed access requests expanding the blast radius of that loss of inbox control or deletion requests causing a lot of grief.  I'd maybe feel different if you were getting a ton of legitimate deletion requests.\n\nAssuming you don't have much info that isn't already present in the UI, I wouldn't go overboard making even access requests fast.  Make sure you get them done within the deadline and leave it at that.  my .02.  Particularly since you're a marketplace, there's likely financial incentives for fraudsters to get access to this data.  I wouldn't facilitate this.",

        "author": "maxstate",
        "id": "z0w6ws",
        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe GDPR is my bread and butter. While it's far from perfect, I think it's a good first step towards wresting control over our data while making people infosec-literate.\n\nMy question was about the interpretation of a particular legal relationship and what it implies about responsibilities. Say that there are two organizations: controller-processor. \n\n* Say that the controller shares a limited dataset A with processor. \n* Dataset A contains a list of names and e-mail addresses, pseudonymized. \n* Dataset B contains much more information about those same people. Dataset B is not shared with processor by controller.\n* Dataset C is the conversion list that can be used to depseudonymize the data between A and B.\n\n**Preliminary conclusion**\n\nIn this case, I think we would all argue that the information in Dataset B is not being processed by the processor, but only by the controller.\n\n**Side remark**\n\nThis is strange to me, as from an information security viewpoint, when talking about pseudonymous data 'leaking', we should assume all \\*other\\* data are already public, so that our last bit would lead to identification. This is somewhat supported by consideration 26 in the GDPR:\n\n>\"\\[...\\]  Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments.\" \n\n**Preface to the question**\n\nMy question revolves around this point and how it works between the various legal relationships between controllers and controllers, and controllers and processors. For the above case, it's easy to argue in practice that chances that both organizations' data will be breached are low, given adequate security measures and so on. So in practice, there should be no issue. \n\nLegally there is no issue either, as the processor processes only what's necessary for them to fulfill the purpose stated by the controller. A good processing agreement will include adequate liability provisions.\n\n**The question**\n\nLet's change the setup a bit. In my line of work there are situations in which a controller 'A' may ask a processor 'B' to (collect and) process some data on their behalf, belonging to random subjects. To maintain a level of 'independence' from each other and not complicate the legal situation, the controller asks the processor to only divulge part of the data they collect to the controller. Sometimes they only divulge results, sometimes aggregated data, etc. But the data are ostensibly *not identifiable* *to controller 'A'*.\n\nI don't like this setup and will argue my point. \n\nBut the argument is brought up often in defense of this that, since no identifiable data is \\***practically and materially**\\* made available to controller 'A', they are \"not really\" processing data. My background is in law: this sounds like a bad argument to me. The controller is responsible for the data they instruct processor 'B' to process on their behalf. It can legally be said that they know of, are responsible for and thus \\*process\\* that data regardless of whether they do so **practially and materially**. \n\nThe legal relationship makes it so. You cannot be responsible for data but not know what that data is or pretend it's not within your power to identify it. If it were to be breached, how would you ever know it was yours? How would you be held accountable?\n\n**Some additional issues**\n\nSo, my view on this is that it is an illegitimate standpoint, and will be qualified by the courts as either some form of dual controller setup or it will indeed be assumed that the controller processes the data regardless of their material access to it. \n\nSay there was a processing agreement in which processor 'B' was in fact an independent controller who agreed to share results and aggregated data that are not identifiable. But that leads me to the question as to whether the definition of a controller (\"defines the purpose and means of the processing\") wouldn't put a stop to that - and if so, how. \n\nIt's a pain in the ass, but it's relatively easy to set up an independent organization 'B' that can be used to funnel ostensibly non-identifiable data to a larger corporate 'A', legally. Since the data are not identifiable in this form, the GDPR is simply not applicable.\n\nGiven sufficient data are collected however, it's very much possible that time will make the data identifiable to the larger corporate 'A', through the mosaic effect for instance (CJEU 184/20, identification by inference). Throughout their tenure, organization 'B' will have acted within their legal purview, even in the case that the data they collected are ostensibly identifiable. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo what do you think? Is the purported independence between controller 'A' and processor 'B' real? Does the legal view prevail, or does the \\*material practice\\*  of processing define responsibility, rather than the legal relationship? Am I missing something here? \n\nOne thing to think about regarding this theme is the American position vis-a-vis territorial scope that, any business that is \"American\" (was founded in, has its HQ in, employs substantially in) is subject to US data law and NSA intrusion.",

Even if it's under a DPA, B is still deciding on who should have access to their data.\n\nI'd suggest you look to the EDPB guidance on controllers and processers: https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-072020-concepts-controller-and-processor-gdpr_en\n\nI would probably evaluate the processing to fall within the \"essential means\" described in paragraph 39-41.\n\nI would probably also argue that A would be able to access the personal information processed with B anyway, due to the responsibilities it has in regards to data subject rights. Otherwise B would need to be a data controller to be able to reject such a request. Unless you have a very well written DPA able to take every possible circumstance into account.\n\n\"Throughout their tenure, organization 'B' will have acted within their legal purview, even in the case that the data they collected are ostensibly identifiable.\"\n\nNo, if B has handed over enough information for it to be identifiable, which is a very small amount these days, then it is considered personal data.\n\nIf A gathers personal data from many such companies to get a dataset where persons would be identifiable, then A would still have the requirement to inform data subjects of the processing, as it has become personal information.

The GDPR covers personal data, which is broad and can includes identifies like an IDFA, IP Address, MAC Address, Cookie Session identifiers, or anything that can identify that it's the same individual - whether identifiable or not.\n\nHowever, pseudonymization can be used as a security precaution/mitigation that is implemented to limit the risk of having to process the data.  For example, when analyzing wage equity data, the processor does not need to specifically know the identities of individuals.  They may only require to know an employee ID where the business itself has the spreadsheet that correlates who these people are.  It is still considered processing personal data under the GDPR as the processor can tie the data back to a single identifier (the Employee ID).  The controller is still required to fulfill article 24, and they have demonstrated one of the technical measures to protect the data via pseudonymization.",

Only about making certain decisions regarding the processing activity.\n\nFrom my perspective, it's very straightforward. It's unarguable that *personal data is being processed*. The Material Scope says GDPR applies. The main question is *who is the Controller*, and the definition in Article 4 points to the party responsible for making certain decisions about the processing.\n\nAt no point in this line of reasoning has data custody or possession been considered. They do not factor into any of the definitions considered. The Article 24 responsibilities bind to the party making decisions.",

Note that actually performing the processing activity is not part of this definition.\n\nThe [EDPB has written guidelines](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-072020-concepts-controller-and-processor-gdpr_en) that analyzes and explains this definition in exhausting detail. The document also contains two relevant examples in paragraph 45:\n\n> 45\\. It is not necessary that the controller actually has access to the data that is being processed. Someone who outsources a processing activity and in doing so, has a determinative influence on the purpose and (essential) means of the processing (e.g. by adjusting parameters of a service in such a way that it influences whose personal data shall be processed), is to be regarded as controller even though he or she will never have actual access to the data.\n>\n> **Example: Market research 1**\n>\n> Company ABC wishes to understand which types of consumers are most likely to be interested in itsproducts and contracts a service provider, XYZ, to obtain the relevant information.\n>\n> Company ABC instructs XYZ on what type of information it is interested in and provides a list ofquestions to be asked to those participating in the market research.\n>\n> Company ABC receives only statistical information (e.g., identifying consumer trends per region) from XYZ and does not have access to the personal data itself. Nevertheless, Company ABC decided that the processing should take place, the processing is carried out for its purpose and its activity and it has provided XYZ with detailed instructions on what information to collect. Company ABC is therefore still to be considered a controller with respect of the processing of personal data that takes place in order to deliver the information it has requested. XYZ may only process the data for the purpose given by Company ABC and according to its detailed instructions and is therefore to be regarded as processor.\n>\n> **Example: Market research 2**\n>\n> Company ABC wishes to understand which types of consumers are most likely to be interested in its products. Service provider XYZ is a market research agency which has collected information about consumer interests through a variety of questionnaires which pertain to a wide variety of products and services. Service provider XYZ has collected and analysed this data independently, according to its own methodology without receiving any instructions from Company ABC. To answer Company ABC’s request, service provider XYZ will generate statistical information, but does so without receiving any further instructions about which personal data should be processed or how to process it in order to generate these statistics. In this example, service provider XYZ acts as the sole controller, processing personal data for market research purposes, autonomously determining the means for doing so. Company ABC does not have any particular role or responsibility under data protection law in relation to these processing activities, as Company ABC receives anonymised statistics and is not involved in determining the purposes and means of the processing.\n\nThese examples are VERY similar to the scenario you present. In both examples, the client (you: A, EDPB: ABC) does not receive or process personal data themselves. The core difference is who decides the purposes and means, and the degree of independence by the service provider.",

The argument that it is would be, well the user can be assumed to password-protect their phone, or at least prevent unauthorised access to it. The argument against is that it's the responsibility of the app creator to provide a username and password barrier, such that the app can't be run without the user logging in, thus providing an extra level of security, (so that, if the phone got stolen, say, and the thief was able to get past the phone unlock screen, there would be another level of security before the personal data was accessible).\n\nIf it is the case that the extra security is required, then doesn't that mean that ANY data stored on a phone by ANY app, whether personal or not, needs to be secured in this way, because it is easily associated with an identifiable person - the person that owns the phone?\n\nIf this is the case, then surely even an app like text edit, or an alarm clock needs to be password protected, because it is storing data that (while not personal in itself) can be easily associated with a natural identifiable person, say in the event of phone theft.\n\nIt seems absurd to me - I'd be interested where the hole is in my reasoning if there is one..\n\nThanks!",

It is typically not appropriate for an app to defend against device loss.\n\nBut this is going to depend on context, as with everything. For highly sensitive applications, it could be appropriate to offer or even require some kind of user authentication. This can be done securely via APIs offered by the operating system. In some rare cases, it might also be desirable to encrypt application data (again, preferably using the hardware-backed OS APIs), even though mainstream phones now have full-disk encryption.\n\nFor example, the Signal application is an E2EE messenger. It provides an optional screen lock feature. Some \"photo gallery\" style apps have password-protected folders. Another example for in-app auth might be in-app payments gated by parental controls.\n\nBut for normal apps that are not particularly sensitive, it wouldn't seem reasonable or appropriate to require such measures.",

In this case, there is a less intrusive way to achieve the same result, so they would fail the necessity requirement. The legitimate interest itself must also be specified according to Art 13 (and 14), be reasonably specific (according to EDPB), and also not illegal. Then there needs to be a balance test weighing the legitimate interests against the fundamental rights and interests (note the lack of \"legitimate\", which means much broader) of the data subject.\n\nMost controllers misuse LI as a sort of catch-all, and since there is little to no enforcement outside of Spain, nothing is done.

So, if you have a website in the US and you have visitors from the EU, the GDPR applies to your domain. As such, I should be able to have control over my own personally identifiable information there too.\n\nI told them this, and throughout all of our email exchanges their response was the same “Our aim is to be the most complete and reliable source of movie, TV, and entertainment information on the web. In order to continue offering our users an accurate and trustworthy service, it is our policy not to alter or delete any kind of correct/factual information from our records. We believe the data listed is factual, as such we cannot remove this as requested.”\n\nAfter a few emails back and forth asking them to try and justify their policy further and why it applies to non-public figures (which they never did), they replied “Our customer service department will not be able to offer any additional insight or action on these matters.”\n\nSo basically I’m shit out of luck. This is super infuriating.\n\nI searched online a bit and saw that an actress had to sue them just to get her age removed from the website, which is not an option for me since I’m poor and live in Europe.

Not a university graduate (I didn't finish it) Fluent in English, French, Spanish and Italian. I've made a career internally: started as an inbound call centre operator - Back Office agent - Head of Backoffice (Coordinator) and now for almost 3 years I'm Data Privacy Coordinator, i.e. responsible that the company complies with GDPR and law. \n\nAll in-house training. \n\nI asked our DPO (external), informally, if he could recommend me some certified Data Privacy courses to 'formalise' my experience. Basically, he told me that I don't need it. He says that, in Spain, these kind of courses are all private, and they are usually done by employees paid by the companies themselves because they cannot train them internally, or lawyers who do not want to do a university master's degree. \n\nThen there is the DPO certification course, but if you don't already work in the legal sector you do very little with it.\n\nSo, I thought, let's look at something different and useful. I did Back Office, I know a bit about cybersecurity, IT helpdesk, writing user guides, logistics and business management. What can I do or should do? \n\nA CyberSecurity course? Or would it be better to invest in something that gives me coaching or training skills? \n\nWhat is that matches with Data Privacy and helps in a resume? ",

Being a DPO or even a coordinator, training delivery is also good to have on your CV, whether it is a formal qualification or even just experience of having delivered privacy training.\n\nIf you want to expand your knowledge a little wider, then look at what cyber security courses might be offered internally or for free (Udemy, Khan Academy etc) to get you started. CISSP is the gold standard but probably too in-depth if you want to remain in a privacy role.\n\n3yrs experience is a great start, there is still a skills shortage for experienced privacy professionals. Don’t undersell yourself and think about applying for a privacy manager or DPO role, though the IAPP qualifications (CIPM & CIPP/E) will help you prove you can operate at a higher level. \n\nBeing multi-lingual helps you stand out from other candidates so look for multi-national companies that will require this (and most likely pay more).\n\nIn all honesty, in your shoes, it would be:\n\nFORMAL:\n1. IAPP CIPP/E & CIPM \n2. Cyber courses with completion certificates \n\nINFORMAL:\n1. Get experience of creating & delivering privacy training\n2. If you haven’t already, try to get experience of reviewing & negotiating 3rd party contracts (especially Data Processing Agreements)\n3. Learn more about aligning to a privacy framework (such as ISO27001)\n4. Learn about privacy tooling such as OneTrust, Microsoft Purview, TrustArc etc\n\nGood luck!",

Am I really subject to GDPR? Is this email a bunch of scam BS (I don't know what their play would be if it was)? Do I even need to reply? Is my draft reply ok? I am just one guy running an old vbulletin forum for vintage cars, not some big fish that's capturing people's data and selling it off. This is really weird to me.\n\n*To Whom It May Concern:*\n\n*My name is Mxxxx Sxxxxg, and I am a resident of Roanoke,  Virginia. I have a few questions about your process for responding to  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data access requests:*\n\n1. *Would you process a GDPR data access request from me even though I am not a resident of the European Union?*\n2. *Do you process GDPR data access requests via email, a website, or telephone? If via a website, what is the URL I should go to?*\n3. *What personal information do I have to submit for you to verify and process a GDPR data access request?*\n4. *What information do you provide in response to a GDPR data access request?*\n\n*To be clear, I am not submitting a data access request at this  time. My questions are about your process for when I do submit a  request.*\n\n*Thank you in advance for your answers to these questions. If there is a better contact for processing GDPR requests regarding xxxxxx.com, I kindly ask that you forward my request to them.*\n\n*I look forward to your reply without undue delay and at most within one month of this email, as required by Article 12 of GDPR.*\n\n*Sincerely,*\n\n*Mxxxx Sxxxxg*\n\nFor what it's worth, Gmail marked it as spam. Not sure why though.\n\nWhen GDPR passed, I looked into what I needed to do, and determined that I didn't need to do anything. I am US-based, not EU. I do not sell any products or market my site to EU users, and of course it's just me so I am a company of less than 250 employees. I don't think I am subject to GDPR to begin with.\n\nFor those familiar with forums, it's just a vbulletin 4-based site. I do run Google Analytics, Google Adsense, and Sovrn affiliate linking.\n\nI looked up this person's email address and they do not appear to be a registered user on my forum. This seems like a random visitor phishing for something, and I'm trying not to make a big deal out of it. Since this person claims to be in the US, I don't think I even need to acknowledge the email, but here's my first draft if I do reply...\n\n*We would not be required to acknowledge a GDPR request from xxxxxx.com users outside of the EU, nor are we subject to GDPR because we:*\n\n*1) Do not sell any products, market or conduct research in the EU, and*\n\n*2) We are an organization with fewer than 250 employees*\n\n*That said, we would be happy to assist you if you think your personal information resides on our site. If you are a registered user of xxxxxx.com, please use the Contact Us link at the bottom of the site page with specific questions about your personal information. We can assist with deleting your account entirely, or we can show you what administrators of the site can see when viewing your account. Generally, the only personally identifying information we store for registered users is email address and IP address. We do not sell or use this information for any commercial purposes.*\n\n**\\*Editing with an update 12/11/21\\***\n\nI received this email again from a \"Kurt Mayfair\". The email is almost exactly the same as the original. This person claims to live in VA, with a potomacmail.com email address. EXCEPT - the references to GDPR have been replaced with CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and Section 1798.130 of the California Civil Code.\n\nI ended up not replying to the original GDPR email, and I plan to ignore this one as well.",

In short, data that has been properly anonymized is not subject to the GDPR - but you have to be careful that it has been properly anonymized, and not just pseudonymised (there's a section on this too). \n\n[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/#pd5](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/#pd5)\n\nBTW - just want to clarify something with the whole consent thing. When you say \"obviously asking for consent to process that data would be appropriate\" - this is the case if you're asking for special category data (ethnicity would count as this), as there's no other lawful basis or Article 9 exemption that you could rely on, but if you're only asking for normal personal data (name, email, address etc, and no special category data) then you could most probably rely on Article 6(1)(f) - legitimate interests. It's usually the case that market research/customer satisfaction surveys etc. with the purpose of helping to improve a business's services can fall under this legitimate interests basis. You therefore wouldn't need to ask for consent at all, but would obviously still need to provide a privacy policy setting out to the data subject exactly what you'll be doing with their personal data. It might be an easier way to do it (if you don't need special category data) - as the issue with asking for consent is that there is way more to GDPR consent than the normal notion of consent in every day life. It has to be specific, informed, unambiguous, opt-in, clear language, evidenced, freely given (the data subject can't suffer any detriment if they don't give it) and has to be able to be withdrawn as easily as it was given. I could go on and on... any more questions just let me know.",

The use of Consent means that consent can be revoked; if these answers are truly anonymous there would be no way for the respondents to take back their consent (based on the information you have provided, that appears to be the case).\n\nLet's assume that consent was the right legal basis for the moment.  If you ignore the consent field, you are basically saying that the data you have you have no idea who consented or not consented - that consent is meaningless.  You collected the data on false pre-tenses which has larger implications.  My recommendation would be to delete all of the data where the consent field is set to \"false\" - with the information you have, you can only assume that they provided it and  expressed that they don't want it to be used for the purpose you've given them.\n\nIn the future, if the data is being collected through an app, you should have 2 boxes that are unchecked and the questionnaire cannot proceed until you select one of them.

        "selftext": "I went to a pharmacy on Friday for a (follow up) vaccination. They were clearly understaffed. My previous visit was 6 months prior.\n\nFirst thing I had to do was book in at the counter, whilst in the (very tediously slow) queue I had time to notice a large lever arch file, just sitting on a side counter (not even fenced off) that clearly contained personal data, full of the same forms I had to fill in once I had checked in. Later my form would go into that file too. Form contained stuff like name, address, GP, medical history etc, so potentially quite confidential stuff. There was only one lady working the counter and she often went behind a shelf so it would have been very easy to look/grab and run with that folder.\n\nWhen I got to the front of the queue I was told they couldn't find my previous paperwork so was given a new one. Excuse was they were understaffed and so hadn't done any filing (for what must have been over 6 months based upon when my last visit was). I queried should I be worried about my personal data, was assured no, but now I'm not so sure - not only should it have been filed, but also forwarded to my GP.\n\nLater on I was taken into a treatment room, and on the desk was a stack of other people's forms, there were also some on the floor still attached to clipboards. Had I been minded to I'm sure I could have learned all about \"John Smith\" and his personal data - probably over 20 people's info in that stack! Worse still I was actually left alone in this room for a while and could have easily read/taken that paperwork and several other folders, presumably full of personal data too. The computer was also left unlocked and open to me to browse/tamper with. I again called up the staff (different person) on this and got met with the same \"understaffed, overworked\" response.\n\nLong story short, I therefore have real concerns that my data (and that of others) is not being stored correctly, therefore breaching GDPR. I have only anecdotal evidence of this - taking photos didn't seem right, and writing some sort of complaint feels silly. Where do I go with this next? UK based.",

Clarify an appropriate approach with your supervisor. Perhaps it might be sufficient to describe your protocol for collecting and analyzing data. Perhaps it makes sense to keep the raw data without publishing it (of course your supervisors for the research thesis would get everything, but for a published paper the data would be \"available upon reasonable request\").

On top of that while aggregating the data on the server-side, if there are not enough responses, it will not be shown and gets deleted.\n\nFrom the GDPR perspective, one of the biggest challenges is the right to be forgotten. One might think that just delete the data and it is gone, but... What about technical logs? What about server logs? But as long as the raw data stays in the app, no personal data has been sent anywhere. If the app gets deleted, the data gets deleted.\n\nAnother benefit is no garbage in - garbage out. As the data is in a single \"scope\" the aggregation on the fly is easy to do. Eventually one year worth of data gets as much space as 10-20 pictures.  \n\n\nCurrently, we are developing it only for mobile apps in different flavours. Hopefully, in near future, we can provide it to the web as well.\n\n[https://dldb.io/](https://dldb.io/)",

Basically, zero-knowledge proof.\n\nForgive me, but to the mathematically inclined, the claim that some product \"basically\" employs some cryptographic technology rings all kinds of alarm bells.\n\nThere are mechanisms where the evaluation of such locally collected data will not reveal information about any one individual, even when linked with other sources of data, with quantifiable certainty (using definitions analogous to attacker models in cryptography). However, for one thing, these mechanisms necessarily involve a *privacy budget*, which for example means that the number of queries that can be made is not unlimited. For another, the statistics of the query results can be somewhat unusual (they can be distributed differently than random sampling error) which has implications for how the data must be handled in further calculations.\n\nSo what is it that you actually do? What guarantees do you actually provide?",

You might be throwing that data away later, but until then it's still personal data. I suspect you'll move to stronger client identity verification anyway in order to combat spam, for example by issuing a nonce alongside the query so that each client can submit at most one response.\n\nBecause the aggregator will necessarily be processing personal data, an app provider will only be able to use such a service if the aggregator is self-hosted or if the aggregator is provided by a data processor who is contractually bound per Art 28 GDPR.\n\nThe nice things about anonymization techniques like Differential Privacy is that we might know which answer came from which respondent, but we can't tell whether their answer was truthful – the aggregate true response can only be approximated across multiple responses.\n\nProcessing location data makes me uneasy, but it can be allowed without user consent if the location data has been truly anonymized.

After several months of using the website, a staff member contacted me and told me that I needed to provide them with a copy of my ID, as well as proof of address if I wished to continue using their website, since they had to be sure that I wasn't a previously banned user.\n\nPrior to that e-mail, another user on the website had warned me that the owner had been collecting IDs from multiple users and had been performing various illegal activities with the documents he acquired. At the time, I didn't take this seriously.\n\nHowever, after receiving the e-mail I sent them a picture of an expired library card, since this couldn't be used to steal my identity as it only has my name on it, and I refused to provide proof of address.\n\nThey replied telling me that they would ban my account if I didn't send in a copy of my passport and proof of address.\n\nThe website had nothing in their T&C pertaining to GDPR, nor was it stated anywhere that they would collect IDs, or what they would do with IDs they received.\n\nI sent them an email requesting that they informed me both what they had done with the picture of the library card I had sent them and requested a copy of all the data they held on me.\n\nThe owner replied with 'lol I can do whatever I want. I don't need to comply with GDPR. I'm Norwegian.'.\n\nI filed a complaint with Datatilsynet, which is the Norwegian authority for GDPR complaints.\n\nDuring the process, Datatilsynet informed me that they wouldn't uphold my complaint unless I gave them an address and a phone number, I provided them with a PO Box, rather than my home address and a temporary phone number.\n\nSeveral months later, Datatilsynet sent me a resolution letter. They had sided with the owner of the website.\n\nDuring the dispute, the owner of the website informed them that while he had violated GDPR, he felt that he had little choice but to do as a shapeshifter was trying to hack his website, so he had to collect IDs and proof of address from everybody to determine who he could trust to prevent the shapeshifter from taking over his website. He claimed that he already knew that most people on the website were the same person as most of his users have Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo e-mail addresses, which he claims are extremely obscure websites that barely anybody uses. He claimed that by refusing to send in my address and passport, I had proven that I was the shapeshifter and therefore he couldn't send me information pertaining to what data he held on me, as I may have shapeshifted into the owner of the library card (myself) in order to deceive him. He then claimed that I had only reported him as I wanted to hack his website and I was trying to use the decision against him to get my account back, which would help me take control of his site.\n\nAnybody who read the paragraph above will quickly realize that the owner of the website is either a terrible liar, or has severe mental health issues. However, Datatilsynet somehow found that story to be credible and has not upheld my complaint, despite the owner confessing to violating GDPR, as they claim that the purpose of my complaint was for personal gain (allegedly wanting to regain my account in order to hack the website, which obviously makes no sense).\n\nNow I'm not sure why Datatilsynet has made this ruling. Perhaps the head of complaints also suffers from mental health issues. Perhaps he will always rule in a Norwegian's favor, should a non-Norwegian file a complaint. Either way, it's clear that the wrong decision was made.\n\nAdditionally, Datatilsynet provided the owner of the website with the address and phone number I provided them with, which is surely a violation of GDPR in itself?\n\nI have asked Datatilsynet how I would go about filing a complaint against them, but their response has simply been 'Take us to court if you don't like how we do things.'.\n\nSo how do I file a complaint against the regulator here, since they are clearly incapable of dealing with complaints?",

This is data that you have provided and the  data the organization has collected about you during your use of their services.\n* Operational Data.  Data that they use to manage the service.  This could be in backups,  webserver logs, what features you used, how long you used them.\n* Security Data.  Data stored in a security log or a Security Incident Event Management System (e.g. your login activity, general location and perhaps other behaviors they are monitoring for).\n* Customer / User management data - this is data they are using to help manage the relationship between you and the organization.\n* Marketing Data.  If you subscribed to newsletters or responded to any marketing they have done.\n\nFor Service and Operational data, it is likely they will have deleted your data and that it will be removed in 30 days as they stated.   Any company worth their salt would have their backups and web server logs on a rotating schedule that does this automatically.\n\nSecurity Data, this would depend on how they are managing the data.  Some companies will hold the data for 1 year for analysis.  If they are using a SIEM, they may not be able to delete the data beyond the timeframe they have set (as a SIEM is often used for legal evidence, there are built to prevent data tampering).  They have some rights over this data, so it may still exist.\n\nCustomer / contract management data - Likely the data is deleted unless they need to hold it as proof of service, if you logged a formal complaint, or requested a legal request (like deleting your data).  Your request to delete data likely sits in a system like this  (e.g. ZenDesk as an example).  However in my experience, data in this area tends to stick around (unless the privacy team is insisting it gets deleted) as the organization would have some rights over the interactions they've had with you.\n\nMarketing Data.  This is usually a message to go through.  Some view a data deletion request is surrounding the products/services that are being offered and that the marketing information remains intact.  Most email marketing has an opt-out where you can explicitly get out of receiving them.  However unless you explicitly state it this data is probably still kicking around (as you were discussing with them account/service level data deletion).  If you want the marketing information gone as well, make sure you let them know.",

I’d follow up with the school as I said before and then you can complain to the ico if they don’t comply.

In addition, if the child is competent, the child can authorise the parent to act on their behalf and receive the response from the school.\n\nTo answer your question, you will need to consider whether your child is mature enough.  If they are not then the school should reply to you.  If they are, the school should reply to the child, or you can get the child to authorise the school to respond to you instead.

One of those is a mobile number and/or home number. I have been arguing with my company for a long time about this: It is meaningless and pointless to verify when we call a person using a phone number that they provided because it is their responsibility to give us a proper number and we would not be responsible if someone impersonates them; we also usually have people's emails and we never verify when communicating by email (I am not even sure how you would do so that..). I am unable to see any difference between the two cases, yet my company insists that we must verify the person when we call them using the number they provide us.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI am currently reading the GDPR because I am genuinely curious about this (The chance of my company changing their views even if I provide correct reasoning is tiny). I understand that it is more general but I am trying to check if there is anything remotely related to this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA few more points to note:\n\n* My company is based in the UK so follows DPA not GDRP technically but my understanding is this would not matter in this case as DPA's base is GDPR (but please correct me if I am wrong!).\n* We are not a large company and there is no one with any legal knowledge whatsoever that I can actually discuss this with at the company unfortunately.\n* The information we deal is personal but is relatively not super sensitive. You cannot do anything with it even if you have it. It is not financial information.\n* I have no issue whatsoever confirming the identity of people who call us.

I happen to know how ROBLOX works so I'll elaborate and try to give you a quick \"GDPR 101 for dummies\" on the subject.  \n\nAt hindsight it might seem like GDPR Is unrelated, as the problem is that OP can't play the game. OP has however asked the private group of people, that own the game on the platform for evidence of him cheating, so OP can then presumably dispute the claim. \n\nPersonal data are any information which are related to an identified or identifiable natural person (Art. 4(1) GDPR). OP mentions in the comments of this thread that they keep \"keep logs of ban reasons, proof of rule violation, your username,  your userid and which moderator banned you. \" These details in fact all say something about OP, and are therefore personal data. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP therefore has the right of access, as stipulated by the GDPR (Art. 15 GDPR). The question here is who the controller is, it seems that the group that owns the game on the ROBLOX platform is the controller here, as the definition of a controller is:  \"the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other  body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and  means of the processing of personal data \". \n\nAssuming then that the group that owns the game is the controller, OP can exercise his rights under the GDPR and submit a data subject access request to the group in question, which they will be required to respond to. Under the right of access, as stipulated by GDPR OP has the right to a copy of his personal data. \n\nOP might not get access to the moderator that banned OP, as that might adversely affect the rights and freedoms of the moderator in question. This obviously depends on many factors and there's no definitive answer. \n\nAnother redditor reffers in the comments to the following link: [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/managing-personal-information](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/managing-personal-information). This however seems to apply to information stored within the ROBLOX platform itself, the information kept on OP like the reason for the ban and proof are probably processed outside of the platform, e.g. in a Trello.   \n\nIn conclusion — In this situation GDPR applies, regardless of who's the controller and who is processing any personal information, since GDPR applies OP can exercise his rights under the GDPR, such as the right of access which should get him a copy of proof they have against him. \n\nIf anyone has a question, don't hesitate to reply or slide into my DM's.",

However, there might be copyright exceptions in your country's copyright law.\n\nFrom the data protection angle, these comments are personal data. Processing them (including storage) is subject to the GDPR. So you would need a *legal basis*. For example, you might have a “legitimate interest” for processing the comments, or you might have to ask for consent. Which legal basis would be appropriate also depends on the specific purpose of processing.\n\nPersonally, I think it's unlikely that a legitimate interest would apply. The other social media users can't reasonably expect that you'd copy their comments for commercial purposes. In particular, I don't think that you'd be allowed to use their comments as testimonials without their consent.\n\nFinally, consider the platform terms of service. You are contractually bound to follow these terms. Possibly, they might allow you to *view* the comments, and permit use of the platform's tools to *embed* the comments on a website, but will not give any license to copy or redistribute other user's content.",

Even if the data subject’s (the user) contract with the data controller (FB) were relevant to you—which it is not—you’d actually be *violating* the only contract in place by violating the FB terms of service. \n\n- Legitimate interest: you need to balance your legitimate interest in processing the data against the data subject’s rights and freedoms. Your interest is in monetizing data the data subject provided to another controller for another purpose. That’s not going to be considered a strong legitimate interest. On the other hand, your data subject’s right not to have their data processed for profit without consent or notice will be given great weight. You’d lose the balancing test.\n\n- Consent: this is your best bet to have a legitimate basis for processing, but you would need GDPR level consent, meaning (at a high level) it’s specific, unbundled, presented in a fair and balanced manner, and revokable.

They stated it was complex SAR so would require three months to respond to \n\nThe reason for this is that he was not allocated any of the five requested schools on the application but rather one just around the corner from his mother's house, from whom I am separated and have a very strained relationship with. \n\nWe had agreed on the five schools between us but I suspect she has chosen the one which is most convenient for her rather than the better schools, which are roughly equally distant between us. \n\nI wish to know what exactly was on the application so submitted a SAR, along with his birth certificate to show I have parental responsibility. \n\nThe council has refused the request on the grounds that the information has been provided by the children's mother and that they have made several attempts to obtain her consent to share this information but have been unable to do so. \n\nMy questions are:\n\nDo I need the consent of the parent who submitted the application to see it? I just want the information relating to my child, not her. \n\nWere the council correct in approaching her for consent?

Under the GDPR, you as a parent don't have a right of access to information held about your child - that right belongs to the child, not to you. You can make a request *on behalf of* your child, either if they consent to you doing so or if they do not have the capacity to do this themselves (which is not a mere question of how old they are - the council would need to determine this based on their knowledge of the child). I assume you do not have the child's consent and I obviously have no idea about your child's capacity but it's quite possible that neither apply in this scenario.\n\nI'd say it's more than appropriate for the council to check with the parent who provided the information. Especially in cases where the parents are separated - they could be opening themselves up to all kinds of legal issues by disclosing information about a child to the other parent without clearing it first. They have to act in the best interests of the child and it is not immediately clear that providing this info would be in line with this.\n\nThere is a separate right for parents to request access to their child's educational record, which I know very little about so I won't pretend to, but that might be a more appropriate mechanism. Ultimately this isn't what SARs are for.",

I'm not going to pull punches here, but tell it as it is, so please if you're angered by the answer just understand this is likely to be the LAs view. I've advised in my DPO role on many of these cases.\n\nFirstly, your child is old enough that they are likely to be competent to understand about their own data, so the LA would need to assess if they were competent, and if so, confirm with your child they are happy for the data to be released. In England, the test is whether the child understands the consequences - \"Gillick Competent\"\n\nIn situations like this there is always concern about parental coercion hence child's consent is very difficult. Unless it's very clear that both parents are not pushing the child to consent / not consent, it's hard to be sure of the child's wishes. This isn't made easier if parents are not cooperating with each other as here.\n\nSecondly, there is information about the other parent in the form, so they would either have to redact or get a consent on that.  That in itself is difficult - because by doing so they again increase the risk of parental coercion on the other side, plus their only legal route to releasing is if the other parent consents; redaction would be complicated too for the same reason.\n\nThirdly, you note police involvement - so the LA is likely concerned about safeguarding; whether the other parent is lying or not, they can't ignore it. They would have to determine if you are a risk to the child, and if the release of information would increase that risk.\n\nThe LA has to take into account the best interests of the child, particularly if consent cannot be clear. If they don't consider it in the best interests of the child, they can refuse to grant access to you. \n\nAnswering your direct questions.\n\n*Do I need the consent of the parent who submitted the application to see it? I just want the information relating to my child, not her.*\r  \n\r  \nAs noted, they would need to either redact her personal data or get her consent, so yes, because the form contained \n\n*Were the council correct in approaching her for consent?* \n\nYou asked for the complete form which included her details. So yes, to release her information; it wasn't needed to release the child's data, that would have been as noted above.\r  \n\r  \n*Can the council not just provide the application with my ex-partner's personal information redacted?*\n\nDepends on the risk they perceive and if the redaction would not increase the risk.\r  \n\r  \n*The SAR was for a single high school application for one child. Would this be considered complex and be justified in using the extended response time scale?*\n\nBecause of the parental separation, the potential safeguarding issues and the fact more than one person's data was on the form. They would have needed to consult the safeguarding team, consider if your child was competent and then consult them if they were, discuss if they could provide the form with the other parent's data redacted safely, and if not, get a consent to sharing from the other parent. There's no \"special department\" for doing SARs in a local authority - this all has to happen around the day job, so yes, extending is not unreasonable.",

A portion of the document was used to verify income to meet income requirements.\n\nDuring the check out process as the tenants moved out, we came into disagreement about amounts owed from the deposit for damages, whether they should use the specific companies I was suggesting, I said I would charge for my time should I be required to get other quotes and the tenants stated those charges and demands were not part of the tenants rights 2019 act and they would dispute and report them.\n\nIt got very heated, and I asked one tenant if she knew I had those sensitive and lengthy documents pertaining to her divorce, whether her ex spouse knew, and that it contained sensitive information about her children, medical issues, and should she want to hurl threats, I could do the same.\n\nThe couple is now filing complaints about my handling of their data. Is there anything I can do to protect myself? I am also not registered with the ICO, so could they even find me. Is this even worth me worrying about? I have the resources to hire the best solicitors necessary but curious whether I should take that step.",
