        "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI am using Google Analytics to track user's interactions on my website.\n\nI added Cookie preference for user and by default only essential cookies are enabled. This means GA scripts won't be loaded unless user gives consent explicitly. \n\nThis resulted in almost 0 events sent to GA as most of users won't toggle on. This kind of defeats the purpose of using tools like GA. Any suggestions about how to enable third-party analytics solutions like GA while being GDPR compliant?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/acsqenode3of1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=e32cba57d22797d48e856fd3c3ed6f2f10b5d4c1\n\n",

Google Tag Manager.\n\nThe cookie banner is a clear case, so let's skip to GTM. The court says that because GTM downloads a script 'gtm.js' and stores that on the client, that's against the ePrivacy directive. That's a very narrow interpretation and would basically mean that _any_ Javascript you load from any server would need consent, unless it is absolutely necessary to provide the site (which is almost never is in the case of scripts, as you can very well just provide a plain HTML site), as the browser will always 'download and store' the Javascript. I understand that the ePrivacy directive can be read this narrowly, but it creates a legal uncertainty where almost every website could be in breach of the ePrivacy directive.\n\nAnother reason they give is that Google is processing data (the IP address). That's true, but Google can just be a processor of the website provider. The transfer to the US is also allowed under the Data Privacy Framework. So the fact that it's Google is not relevant.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I would really like to see GTM-usage being banned. But I would really have preferred if that decision was either based on 1.) Transfer of data to the US (e.g., invalidating DPF and/or usage of SCCs) or 2.) The fact that Google does further processing of the data and does not act strictly as a processor (which is probably the case, but was not proven in this case, they merely state that Google's business model is to process a lot of personal data).",

Ultimately, this judgment is not about GTM, but about consent.\n\nThe judgment is not quite making the argument that the *downloading* of the `gtm.js` script itself is storage of information, and thus subject to the ePrivacy rules. Instead, it says that this GTM script *performs* access/storage of information, which is then subject to ePrivacy, even when GTM hasn't loaded any 3rd party tags yet.\n\nBtw, the EDPB does promote a fairly narrow interpretation of access and storage of information in their [Guidelines 2/2023 on Technical Scope of Art. 5(3) of ePrivacy Directive](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-22023-technical-scope-art-53-eprivacy-directive_en). For example, they argue that even transient storage in RAM counts as storage for the purpose of this law. But the EDPB doesn't see the downloading as a script or HTML page as storage, unless that download acts as a tracking pixel.\n\nThe international data transfer aspect kind of gets lost between all the text. The key points are as follows, but they're analogous to the GDPR consent problem.\n\n* The case was filed in late 2022, before the DPF came into force.\n* The website connected to the US-based GTM servers upon page load.\n  * This is an international data transfer.\n  * This is also processing of personal data, requiring a legal basis.\n* The consent banner requested consent to international data transfers per Art. 49(1)(a). This was too late, as the transfer had already happened at that point. Any consent was also invalid, because this detail was hidden below the fold.\n* For the processing of personal data, none of Art 6(1)(a) \"consent\", Art 6(1)(c) \"legal obligation\", or Art 6(1)(f) \"legitimate interest\" apply.\n  * Legal obligations are completely off.\n  * Any consent would come too late.\n  * The three-step legitimate interest balancing test fails because using GTM is neither necessary (there are less invasive alternatives), nor does the legitimate interest outweigh the data subjects' rights and interests.\n\nAll of this, and especially the legitimate interest aspect, is reminiscent of the infamous “Google Fonts” case. But there's a key difference. I believe the Google Fonts thing would have to be decided differently if Google were  to act as a data processor. But for this GTM case, it doesn't matter that much how the script was *served* (beyond the Art 49 issues), and the focus is more on what this script *does*.\n\nI'm also not sure when, if ever, Google acts as a processor for GTM? There are [GTM terms of service](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7157428) which explain that Google may use some of the data, but also that GTM customers [may enter into a data processing agreement](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7207086), though [the agreement doesn't discuss GTM](https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/).",

This whole time she’s trying to go back and forth explaining it’s okay, it’s normal, but I just didn’t want it to be scanned to which she said then I’d have to for the subject access request even longer which I would have preferred. \n\nTbh, I just don’t understand why they scanned my passport after I asked them twice not to, they didn’t say at any point a scan was required and then to see my scanned passport copy torn into pieces and thrown into their bin at the front, not even securely shredded, it felt so weird..\n\nIdk what to do, should I write to them to ask them to securely dispose of the torn up passport copy?

This is where you would use a model release form, which is a separate processing purpose requiring a separate lawful basis, typically “fulfilment of a contract”, but some will use consent on the basis that the withdrawal of consent, provided it is made clear at the time of consent, does not render any processing that took place prior to the withdrawal unlawful. It’s a difficult to square that fully with the ongoing processing that happens, so the advice I give is that contract is the most appropriate basis and the consideration for images being used from events should involve a gift/gesture (non-watermarked copy of the images for personal use, gift card, etc).",

To the degree that you're subject to GDPR, and to the degree that other laws like ePrivacy don't provide more specific rules, you may only process this data as necessary for a legal basis.\n\n\nUsing a third party geolocation provider may be entirely appropriate, if that provider is contractually bound to act as your data processor.\n\n\nBut if we're talking about controller-to-controller data sharing, things get much more difficult. I don't think you can do this lawfully. Compare also the structurally similar problems \"can my website load fonts from Google Fonts?\" or \"canny website embed a Facebook Like button?\".\n\n\nExcept perhaps if you can anonymize the IP addresses? Country-level geolocation does not need the full IP, just the corresponding ASN block (at least for IPv4, I'm less sure about IPv6). That information is public, so you may be able to chop off part of the IP address before querying a third party API from your backend. But this is just an idea – I haven't done the math on whether this would provide sufficiently strong technical privacy guarantees to serve as the foundation of a legal argument that you may do without a data processing agreement.\n\n\nFor what it's worth, some CDN services already provide the IP-based country for each HTTP request.",

So again you’d have to get all websites and all browsers to agree to some common way of categorising cookies.\n\nAnd what if it doesn’t work for some reason?

Most analytics involve some kind of client ID, e.g. in order to stitch visits into sessions. Generating or storing this ID will typically fall under the ePrivacy consent requirement, but since this ID also identifies a user, these analytics will also fall under the GDPR.\n\nIf there is some kind of processing activity that doesn't touch on ePrivacy but only involves GDPR, then things are a lot more flexible. You would no longer be forced to rely on consent, and could e.g. perform a legitimate interest balancing test.\n\nMy personal belief (but others disagree) is that client-side analytics will always require consent. The only viable path towards collecting consent-free statistics is to look at server side data that you get anyways, for example classic logfile analytics.\n\nSome EU data protection agencies tolerate basic first-party analytics even without consent.

As others have mentioned here - as long as there is no PII you should be okay. \n\nAs for the low opt-in rate - you can play around with your banner design (although gdpr requires the same color for both accept and reject buttons), positioning (as others have mentioned), and banner text. Sometimes a more light hearted approach (if it fits your brand image) works better than the scary huge privacy notice. Also - make sure you are checking on which device you have the most traffic from. Your banner on Mobile needs to be visible and easy to interact with, no blocking by other elements. Usually it likes to break on different screen sizes/browsers so test it out many, many, maaaany times. \n\nAlso undermined - banner language. You probably know this but look over your main traffic geos - if it's possible on your end, show the appropriate language for your main sources to help opt-in.\n\nImplied consent is something a bit different - it means you are treating a certain banner event apart from Accept as consent and you are enabling tracking for the user which does not seem to be the case.",

Obviously, having a specific record of each person's consent can be useful if anyone disputes it, but failure to keep a record isn't inherently a breach. \n\nIf someone were to make a complaint (e.g. to the regulator), the controller's response might be:\n1. We always ask for consent before taking the photo,\n2. We reiterate the request for consent after taking the photo, and delete the photo if consent is not granted at this stage, \n3. Here is a copy of our policy/procedure document that sets out the above process, \n4. Here is a copy of an email evidencing that the photographer was briefed on the above policy, \n5. Here is a copy of a statement from the photographer confirming that they followed this policy at this event,\n6. Here is a copy of the photograph in question - the person in it obviously knows they are being photographed and is posing for the camera,\n7. Ergo, this photo would not have been added to social media page if we didn't have consent. \n\nIt would then be up to the regulator (or a court) to decide on the balance of probabilities whether they believe consent was obtained in the specific case being complained about. \n\nObviously, having a specific record of consent significantly reduces the risk of the regulator finding against you in the above case, but personally, I think in the circumstances of this case, it's likely they would accept the above.\n\nObviously, there are cases of higher risk processing (e.g. medical data) where it is likely that undocumented verbal consent would not be considered sufficient.

You also have to consider retention rules and whether the personal data held continues to be relevant (e.g. the corporate subscriber may no longer work there or have moved roles).

Then send a reconsent email explaining that your company respects the GDPR, outlining the legal basis for the request, and asking your clients if they would like to consent to continue receiving your emails. If they agree, they should click on button X (or use any other technical solution offered by your emailing tool).\n\nIf your company has a list of contacts that is given priority (specific important commercial partner, relevant client), send a personalised message to them.\n\nIf your company knows where the email database comes from, state the origin (e.g. 'We have your email because you subscribed to our newsletter' or 'We have your email because we met at exhibition X'). If a person doesn't remember interacting with your company, they may treat these reconsent emails as bait that shows their address is active, and ignore your email.\n\nIf the email database was obtained illegally, you probably won't disclose this, but you MUST send a reconsent email as soon as possible – or drop everything if you want to be really compliant to GDPR.\n\nAlso remind them in this message what your emails will be about, how often they can expect to receive them, and what they will miss out on if they decide to stop receiving them. Show them the value of remaining on your database and of opting in. Remind them that they can unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email.\n\nThere's always a risk that people won't opt in, but if they don't read your emails or don't care about your company, what's the point of keeping them in your database? Sending messages to millions of addresses that aren't interested in your company or that deliver your company emails to the spam folder just costs money.\n\nLet go of hoarding millions of emails from people who don't care about your company.

        "selftext": "I've received an email from one of our service providers who announced that they delivered a cookie-less tracking solution that eliminates the need to rely on Consent Mode.\n\nI appreciate that cookie consent is more a question of PECR. And if you don't use cookies, PECR is probably not relevant, however: the whole GDPR is about active consent and clarity as to what your PII is being used for and how it's collected. \n\nSo I think that this is an interesting legal question and potentially moral a moral one:\n\nAs far as I see it, \"Consent Mode\" is a reaction to GDPR, enshrined into UK law in the Data Protection Act of 2018, and Cookie laws (PECR). So to say that cookie-less tracking is a solution that circumvents Consent Mode, is a bit disingenious. Tantamount to saying: Google put up restrictions that make it a tad more challenging to ignore the GDPR, so let's use cookie-less tracking to ignrore the law...\n\nDon't get me wrong here, I am not calling the supplier out. I'm primarily interested in where you stand on the issue I describe? And more widely, why do you think this industry is so keen on flaunting the spirit of the law, if not the law itself? - I practically never see a website that has properly addressed GDPR and PECR in the way the regulation was written or what it was intended to do.\n\nThe Rule of Law should be important to all of us. Ignoring the law just furthers lawlessness. And lawlessness makes universal lawlessness a requirement. Businesses that flaunt to the law have an advantage over businesses that adhere to it, obviously. So it's not fair, you aren't competing if you don't break the law.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nAddendum:\nThank you for the replies. I too believe that if the data that's collected is personally identifiable, and since transaction logging is part of this, it almost certainly is PII.\nSo you circumvent cookies and require no consent here, but you still need consent for the tracking.\n\nI would like to know what everyone's opinions are regarding the digital industry's willingness to disregard the (spirit of the) law?",

But that's definitely something good! This is not a shady workaround, this is data minimization in action!\n\nHowever, such cookieless analytics must still address the question of GDPR legal basis. Either the argument is that no personal data is being processed for analytics purposes and thus no legal basis is necessary (usually wrong, even the act of anonymization is itself a data processing activity), or that the analytics processing can be based on a legitimate interest (a much more defensible argument, but not automatically true).\n\nMy personal opinion (mostly inspired by more hardline EU views such as those of the EDPB) is that it is very difficult to create truly cookieless analytics. PECR/ePrivacy is not solely about cookies, but about accessing *any* information stored on the user's device. This may include things as benign as retrieving the visitor's screen size. On the question of legal basis, I feel that if the analytics works on the level of (anonymous) page views, then it will be straightforward to pass a legitimate interest balancing test. But if the analytics solution creates GA-style visitor profiles (e.g. in order to distinguish new vs recurring visitors), or if invasive data is collected (e.g. mouse movements), then this LI balancing test becomes much more difficult.\n\nThe UK ICO, on the other hand, tends to be much more relaxed about such matters. Authorities in the UK and EU tend to be more focused on *advertising* than *analytics*. The line between those two is not always clear though, e.g. Google Analytics can be used with or without integration with the Google ads ecosystem.",

If the answer is a clear \"NO, it is and will be impossible\",  than that's anonymization.

Taken individually they are not to be considered personal data but together they are because they **can** identify a single individual (even if not easy as requires many birth dates of people living in the area).

From the ICO website explanation, this seems to be akin to a \"soft opt-in\".\n\nWhen a user places an order on our website, the following points are true:\n\n* they may or may not be an existing customer (ie this might be their first purchase)\n* they may or may not hold an account with us (we do not require an account sign-up)\n* we only ever market our own products and services from the same website\n* we give the option to opt-out of marketing emails during the checkout process\n* we give the option to opt-out of marketing emails in every communication\n\nSome of the ICO wording makes it unclear whether a new user completing their first purchase is still an \"existing\" customer. The rule appears to differ between \"new\" and \"existing\" customers. In my interpretation of the wording, our website gathering their contact details for the upcoming purchase makes that user an existing customer.\n\nI see Rule #3 on the sidebar - but based on these points above, does our scenario seem like it meets the criteria for a \"soft opt-in\"?\n\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\n",

If I mail the bakery to say I am interesting in their job vacancy and therefore have enthusiastically read all their blog posts, but GA only shows a single click on their rarely visited /vacancies page but none of their blog posts that day, they can reasonably conclude I'm a liar -- they'll have to argue it could have been someone else and I could have simultaneously been using a Pi hole DNS sink or a cookie blocker. It would get silly quickly.\n\nMy point however was that the **ePrivacy regulation requires an opt-in for non-essential cookies**, and **GA stores those trackers on a user's machine when their scripts are loaded**. So **not asking for consent (or not before loading these) is not compliant, regardless of whether you can identify the person.**\n\nEven before the NOZ case took it a step further, and said consent is needed even if (tracking) cookies are not yet stored on the user's machine. I don't have the full text but, [according to this user](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/1m43wb3/comment/n44yjee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), the ruling is that the 'gtm script performs access/storage of information, which is then subject to ePrivacy, even when gtm hasn't loaded any 3rd party tags yet'.

Basically consent is a legal basis that you cannot rely upon, because to be valid it must be given purely out of altruism or generosity, without getting anything in return, else it's not freely given.\n\nOne escape hatch is that in some countries like France the local authorities consider you can send unsolicited emails to customers who have **already** bought something from you (product or service, whatever), the legal basis being legitimate interest. **But** the customer must have been previously informed and given the option to say no, and the emails must be about products/services similar to what you have already sold them.",

The data subject must not suffer *detriment* for withrawing (or refusing) consent. But consent can still be incentivized. It is not always clear where the loss of incentive turns into detriment, but I think that the surge of consent-or-pay walls will soon lead to a lot of jurisprudence on the matter.\n\nIn their [2020 guidelines on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en), the EDPB discusses all facets of consent, but of course tries to avoid speculating. In the section on \"detriment\", they say:\n\n> The GDPR does not preclude all incentives but the onus would be on the controller to demonstrate that consent was still freely given in all the circumstances.\n\n---\n\n> in some countries like France the local authorities consider you can send unsolicited emails to customers \n\nThat's not a France thing. You're paraphrasing Art 13(2) of the ePrivacy Directive, which has been implemented in national law by all EU members (and the UK):\n\n> Notwithstanding paragraph 1, where a natural or legal person obtains from its customers their electronic contact details for electronic mail, in the context of the sale of a product or a service, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, the same natural or legal person may use these electronic contact details for direct marketing of its own similar products or services provided that customers clearly and distinctly are given the opportunity to object, free of charge and in an easy manner, to such use of electronic contact details at the time of their collection and on the occasion of each message in case the customer has not initially refused such use.",

For example, if joining the retailer’s loyalty scheme comes with access to money-off vouchers, there is clearly some incentive to consent to marketing.

There is no “purity” requirement where a data subject must give consent solely out of the goodness of their own heart for consent to be valid, as alluded to in your other comment. Consent is inherently transactional by definition.  A data subject is allowing a controller to use data for a specific purpose with their agreement.  Often they will not do that unless they stand to gain some perceived benefit from doing so.  Consent to direct marketing -> receive emails containing info the data subject presumably wants to receive.  Consent to location data processing-> receive information based on specific location rather than more general information that may not be as relevant.  Etc.  The GDPR does not prohibit any of those things - what it prohibits is making giving consent to something that is not necessary a condition of receiving a service.

In para 38 of the aforementioned guidelines:\n\n> The EDPB considers that consent cannot be considered as freely given if a controller argues that a choice exists between its service that includes consenting to the use of personal data for additional purposes on the one hand, and an equivalent service offered by a different controller on the other hand. In such a case, the freedom of choice would be made dependent on what other market players do and whether an individual data subject would find the other controller’s services genuinely equivalent.

I really dislike that they left the door open like this, because as you said now we have consent-or-pay walls everywhere which are considered legal by default until a DPA or court finds time/willingness to evaluate it on a case by case basis. Until then it's probably violating GDPR. The website knows it, but they also know it works until the authorities (maybe) take the time to evaluate their specific case.\n\nIn France it's ridiculous, the CNIL ruled that such a wall is OK if the user is able to find an equivalent service/product on another website which does not have the wall (I kind of remember that it's an EDPB thing too...). I don't see how that's enforceable. And I don't see how that's relevant: Most authorities already ruled that on a cookie wall if you have to make more efforts to say \"no\" than you have to say \"yes\" (e.g. because the \"no\" button is hidden in submenus but the \"yes\" button can be accessed on the initial menu and/or is very visible) then the cookie wall is illegal as the consent is not freely given. IMO that's exactly the same with that \"equivalent service/product on another website without pay-or-okay wall\": On the one hand the user can say \"yes\" in one click, but to say \"no\" they have to look for another website to **maybe** find one. And what are they supposed to do if they don't find any? File a complaint to the CNIL? How do we evaluate the ability of a specific internet user to find stuff on the web? For instance is it expected that an old person has the same ability to search the web than a teenager? Loopholes everywhere, which are to the detriment of privacy until an authority maybe does something, which could take years.\n\n>That's not a France thing. You're paraphrasing Art 13(2) of the ePrivacy Directive, which has been implemented in national law by all EU members (and the UK)\n\nInteresting! It existed in France before said directive and even before GDPR. Maybe it ended up in the directive because it's a common disposition in multiple countries? Or maybe France influenced it? (AFAIK France influenced GDPR a lot with its \"Loi informatique et libertés\" of 1978)",

A child understands that if you give the choice between pay with money and pay with your data it pushes most people to pay with their data, in part because they think they \"don't have anything to hide\". So on top of not beeing freely given, their consent is not informed, as most people have no idea to what they are actually consenting (surveillance capitalism). A lot of people boycott websites with a \"money or cookies\" wall because they obviously feel like the website is trying to force their hand. Again, a child would feel tricked too.\n\nWe could also talk about the fact that in most cases the \"pay with your money option\" is more profitable to the company than the \"pay with your data\" option.

In addition, noyb raised the concern that signing up for the paid subscription is substantially more complicated than simply “consenting” to being tracked. All of these issues were ignored in the LfD’s decision.\n\nAh yes, there is also the issue that clicking \"yes, gimme cookies\" is way easier than creating an account, entering your credit card info and subscribing, so most users just pay with their data, even if they could afford not to.

They are the only data broker to outright refuse to delete my data and I’m considering legal action. They try to force you to sign up on their system to claim the profile they made of you without your consent. I’m pretty sure this is illegal as under Section 1798.105 of CCPA they must delete your data and add you to an “opt out” list within 45 days of your request. I’m not giving them more data (by making an account) so that they can delete my data.

However, this is not deemed to be explicit consent, and if you check the ICO website, it explicitly states that this is not acceptable.\n\n>your consent requests **must** be ‘clearly distinguishable from other matters’ — ie they **must not** be bundled as part of terms and conditions wherever possible;\n\nReference: [https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guidance-on-the-use-of-storage-and-access-technologies/what-are-the-rules/#what\\_does\\_consent\\_mean](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guidance-on-the-use-of-storage-and-access-technologies/what-are-the-rules/#what_does_consent_mean)\n\nSome businesses claim the soft opt-in exception applies (meaning the customer has bought a product/service from you recently). However, to rely on this, you still must have given them a clear chance to opt out at the time of collection. It sounds like your company is not doing this, which makes their approach non-compliant.\n\nIf customers are led to believe their email is solely for a receipt or returns but are then added to a marketing list without explicit agreement, this is misleading and unlawful. If reported, the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) should take enforcement action against your company.\n\nHOWEVER, my experience is that they won’t. They simply do not have the time or inclination to take action on every complaint. What they will do is log it as a complaint against the company, and if that company starts appearing frequently in their complaint data, they may consider taking action if there is sufficient evidence of a breach.\n\nI completely agree that this is unethical. Clearly, you have a strong moral conscience and respect for others—thank you, we need more people like this in society.\n\nBut is this the hill you want to die on? I suspect that raising this with your employer is unlikely to do you any favours. It is far more likely to damage any chances you have of progression or development within that company.\n\nMy professional advice: go in guns blazing—this kind of practice drives me crazy.\n\nMy personal advice: keep your head down, report it to the ICO, keep evidence (though you’re unlikely to need it), and play the corporate game. If you don’t like it, vote with your feet and move to a different employer—but bad news: most retail companies are doing this.",

(This might be a better option if it's a small organisation, and/or it's been very obvious you've been making a fuss about this.)\n\nI might well be worrying too much - but having had some bad workplace experiences myself, I know it's very rarely worth making an obvious fuss about something, however well-intentioned.

I am aware of NOYB’s cases and the decisions of some DPAs (e.g., Austria, France), but would like clarity on whether this situation is widely accepted as a breach under current guidance.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n* Is the mere firing of a `collect` request to Google Analytics (before opt-in) enough to be deemed a GDPR/ePrivacy violation?\n* Can the operator argue “legitimate interest” for such requests, even if the purpose is analytics?\n* Does the fact that Google might not use the data for advertising affect the compliance status?\n\nMy goal is to present findings rigorously and fairly in a peer-reviewed publication, and I would like to be certain that identifying such traffic constitutes a valid basis for claiming non-compliance.",

The most common way, which Google provides out of the box, is called Consent Mode, which you can read about here: [https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/concepts/consent-mode#consent-behavior](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/concepts/consent-mode#consent-behavior)\n\n>In general, when users grant consent, tags function normally.\n\n>When users deny consent for ad personalization or ad user data, tags or app SDKs can't use user data for ad targeting purposes.\n\n>When users deny consent \\[or before they consent\\] for storage, consent-aware tags or app SDKs do not store cookies (web) or device identifiers (apps). Instead, tags communicate consent state and user activity by sending cookieless pings (web), or signals (apps), to the Google server.\n\nGoogle Analytics has a feature called Behavioural Modelling that attempts to use that \"ping\" data to estimate or impute the data that wasn't able to be collected: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11161109](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11161109)\n\n>When users don't grant consent, events are not associated with a persistent user identifier. For example, if Analytics collects 10 page view events, it can’t observe and report whether that’s 10 users or 1 user. Instead, Analytics applies machine learning to estimate the behavior of those users based on the behavior of similar users who do accept analytics cookies or equivalent app identifiers.\n\nTheir argument from a GDPR perspective would be that because the data does not contain enough information to uniquely identify an individual person, it is not personal data. This argument does perhaps run into some issues, not least of which is that the user's IP address is still exposed to Google in the non-consent case, but some authorities have recommended enabling Consent Mode as a way to achieve compliance so the picture is not clear. Which may well have been Google's intention.\n\nIn your position, I would validate this by checking the cookies that are being left by the Google Analytics script, rather than looking at the `collect` calls.",

However, as far as I can tell, the guidelines don’t explicitly require consent to be stored in this way. In fact, the same document also says:\n\n>“Controllers are free to develop methods to comply with this provision in a way that is fitting in their daily operations. At the same time, the duty to demonstrate that valid consent has been obtained by a controller should not in itself lead to excessive amounts of additional data processing. This means that controllers should have enough data to show a link to the processing (to show consent was obtained), but they shouldn’t be collecting any more information than necessary.”\n\n**So my questions are:**\n\n* Have any of you implemented a consent log in your own cookie consent solution?\n* What are your thoughts on how best to demonstrate consent?",

Not based on any personal data collected by Halifax.\n\n**Scenario B:**\n\nThis sitaution sounds like personal data is being shared from Halifax with Lloyds. So you need to know what Halifax data subjects have agreed to (because each sub-brand is an separate data controller); did they agree that their personal and financial data can be shared with Lloyds or not for marketing?  Ideally I would expect several opt-in checkboxes on Halifax webforms or contractual agreements with respect to data sharing for marketing purposes.  (1) to agree to marketing from Halifax; and (2) that personal and financial data can be shared for marketing purposes to the Lloyds for marketing purposes.  If financial data is being shared to the parent organization, I would review the contracts to make sure it's permissible to use the data for marketing - especially because the sub-brands are considered data controllers.",

Even when just looking only at the ePrivacy aspect, their fingerprinting would be treated as equivalent to cookies by a reasonable ePrivacy interpretation.\n\n\n3. Their anonymization claims (which would resolve GDPR legal basis issues) hinge on the \"salt\" actually being forgotten after one day, but it's impossible to prove that they actually do this (unless they start publishing relevant audits). Even then, they are still processing not-fully-anonymized data for the current day, which still requires a GDPR legal basis.\n \n4. Claims about GDPR compliance must be taken with a grain of salt. I believe that Plausible itself as a data processor is fully compliant, but that doesn't mean that Plausible's customers as data controllers would also be compliant. In the end, the customers are responsible for figuring out themselves whether they must ask for consent first.\n\n\nIn total, I think that Plausible is fantastic from a \"data minimisation\" and Art 32 GDPR \"technical and organisational measures\" perspective, but does little to address Art 6 GDPR legal basis issues, and arguably does little to address ePrivacy consent issues.",

In your case, by storing a **unique session\\_id** that renews every 24 hours, there is an element of tracking, which may require user consent.\n\nThe GDPR has a broad definition of **personal data**, including any information that can directly or indirectly identify a user. **Recital 30 of the GDPR** specifies that online identifiers, such as cookies and other elements stored on the user's device, can be considered personal data when they allow tracking or linking to other information. If the **session\\_id** enables the association of the user with specific interactions on the site, it falls within this category and must comply with data protection regulations.\n\nThe key point is that **the GDPR requires prior and explicit consent for any data storage on the user's device that is not strictly necessary for the website's operation**. If your script is used for analytical purposes or any other function that is not essential for the user's experience, consent becomes mandatory. Additionally, the user must have full transparency regarding the collection and storage of this information and must be able to accept or refuse this collection before it occurs.\n\nTo ensure compliance with the GDPR, you would need to implement a mechanism that obtains the user's **free, informed, and unambiguous consent** before storing the **session\\_id** in localStorage. This consent must be recorded, and the user must have the possibility to revoke it at any time, meaning that there must also be a clear way to delete or disable this storage. Ideally, you should use a cookie banner that, in addition to informing the user about data collection, provides an option to accept or reject this practice before any data is stored.\n\nTherefore, contrary to the perception that merely storing information in localStorage does not constitute data processing, the GDPR considers that **the act of collecting and storing data is enough to require compliance with its guidelines**. If there is any possibility of identifying or tracking the user, even indirectly, prior consent must be obtained.",

                "body": "The ePrivacy Directive is commonly known as the \"cookie law\" and specifies when you're allowed to access or store data on the end user's device over a network (whether as cookies, LocalStorage, URL query parameters, or otherwise):\n\n* allowed if the user gave **consent**\n* allowed if the access or storage is **strictly necessary** for a service that they **explicitly requested**\n* **otherwise, forbidden**\n\nDetails and precise wording depend on the concrete EU member state you're in, as EU Directives must first be implemented as national laws.\n\nIf you are of the opinion that consent may not be required for particular client-side storage or data access, it falls upon you to make the argument that storing/accessing this information is indeed strictly necessary.\n\nFor example, storing a session ID is probably strictly necessary for a site that offers log-in functionality and when the user is logged in. CSRF tokens are probably strictly necessary. \"Personalization\" very likely is unecessary – there core features of your site that the user explicitly requested will likely work without personalization. What is necessary must always be thought from the user's perspective.\n\nSo on to your concrete questions:\n\n> 1) Do I need to request consent for them through CMP?\n\nDepends on the exact purposes of the data storage/access under these categories. You would have to show that this access/storage is strictly necessary.\n\n> 2) If not through CMP - how do I request consent for those?\n\nStick with your consent management tool.\n\nHowever, in some cases, it can make sense to avoid asking for consent in a banner where users don't have the necessary context. Instead, it can be better to ask for consent \"just in time\" as the consent becomes necessary.\n\n> 3) Are these consents talk about storage in user browser? or anywhere at all?\n> what if I store on my server -> do I still need to request consent via popup question? \n\nThe ePrivcy consent rules are about client-side storage or data access. This is commonly called the \"cookie law\", but applies to any client-side storage. It also applies when the data in question is not personal data.\n\nThese ePrivacy consent rules do not apply to server-side data processing. That doesn't automatically mean all server-side storage is legal. You'd still have to consider GDPR if the data in question is personal data (it usually is). The GDPR expects that you have a \"legal basis\", but here \"consent\" isn't the only alternative.\n\nAlso, this isn't the loophole you might think it is. Server-side storage still typically requires some client-side storage (like a session ID cookie) in order to link the data. Also, accessing data on the user's device in order to send it to the server is also subject to ePrivacy.\n\nOne topic I'm passionate about is consent-free analytics. Analytics *generally* require consent because they involve setting cookies in order to track user sessions and recurring visitors. Some analytics solutions are cookie-free, but still use a bit of JavaScript that extracts data from the browser and sends it to an analytics server – that too looks like \"accessing information over a network\" that's subject to the ePrivacy consent rules. Then, the only consent-free analytics approach would be purely server-side, e.g. doing classic 90s-style log file analysis.\n\n> I've read the google docs but they are extremely vague\n\nGoogle cannot give legal advice (and neither can I).\n\nBut you must understand Google's position as an ad network. All this documentation and features like \"consent mode\" primarily serve to insulate Google from liability. I think that the \"consent mode\" also isn't intended to help publishers with GDPR or ePrivacy compliance, but to protect Google when it comes to ad data sharing that is subject to the Digital Markets Act.",

You, a controller, are still sharing personal data (at minimum and unavoidably, that IP) with a 3rd party, Google.  Moving past that objection, and assuming that you haven't configured GA/gtm to set any first (or 3rd, which I don't know if they do by default) party cookies:\n\nYou still have an eprivacy problem.  GA will highly likely set a first party cookie and transmit that to the server.

Congrats!\n\nThe scheme involves a client ID or session ID or whatever, which is stored in the browser and is reused across multiple pages. Thus, this ID allows linking a user's activities over a certain time frame (e.g. a 12 hour window). A scheme that would want to minimize the application of the GDPR might want to eliminate this identifier, e.g. creating a random ID when transmitting each event, preventing any linking. Note that the [GA Consent Mode](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10000067?sjid=5886597897085787556-EU) always creates an ID, but only persists it once consent is given (when configured properly).\n\nRemoving the semi-persistent ID would reduce the remaining ePrivacy concerns, but access to other information on the user's device (e.g. screen and viewport dimensions) might still trigger a consent requirement, unless retrieving that information is strictly necessary for a service requested by the user.\n\nMy tip would be to do as much as you can server-side. You can potentially ingest custom data into GA via the Measurement Protocol.

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nThere was recently a public Facebook post about an individual, who was expelled from a boarding school in Norway, due to lying about their whereabouts one weekend, and then being forced to the vice rectors house (which is right next to the school - important to clarify), to write a written apology. They then decided to record this conversation, and the vice rector discovered this, and threatened to expel the student, which she did. I'll quote what happened here, just so we know the full context here: \"After the weekend trip incident, Vice Principal (name removed) “invited” me to her home. There, I was forced to write an explanation of what had happened. I was told I could not return to campus or my dorm until this was done in her living room. To protect myself, I recorded the conversation. When the vice principal discovered this, she became furious and said she would make sure I was expelled.\"\n\nNow, it came to my attention, that 1. Norway is a one-party consent country, so you can record a conversation that you are a part of, as long as you participate in the conversation. AFAIK, the student never shared this conversation. And 2. Norway is subject to the GDPR, if the data processing goes beyond the scope of \"purely personal or household activity\". Where I get a little confused, is if the GDPR is applicable in this case, and somehow supersedes Norwegian privacy law here, or what? This case is personal, but the boarding school is also an actor here, but this conversation was also recorded in someone's private residency, while the student was \"forced\" to write a written apology, regarding to the school's Code of Conduct, so I am a little confused as to how to interpret this.\n\nIf you could help me understand, then that'd be great. Thanks!\n\nEdit: and the reason the GDPR is being brought up in this case, is because someone said that the student was in the wrong because of recording the conversation without her consent because if the GDPR, and in spite of Norway's one-party consent laws, hence me making this post.",

I’m not really sure what you mean by “one way consent” but GDPR requires “controllers” to have a lawful basis to process personal data. However, that lawful basis does not have to be consent. This particular situation doesn’t sound like it’s really a GDPR issue; the student recording the conversation is essentially doing so for personal reasons and is therefore not covered by GDPR. That doesn’t mean the school can’t expel them though, it just means they’re not breaching GDPR. The school, as a controller, would likely need to have a lawful basis to record the conversation, but it wouldn’t necessarily need to be consent - it could be legitimate interests, for example. However it would likely need to tell the student about the recording, provide a copy on request etc. But it’s a moot point because it sounds like the school didn’t record anything. So the student probably hasn’t breached GDPR, but that in itself isn’t a reason not to expel them. If the school is saying that the student HAS breached GDPR and that’s why they’re being expelled, then that’s probably wrong, but they could just as easily have their own “no recording” policy if they wanted.",

I'm not a lawyer, but I wouldn't assume that a voice is personally identifiable.  \nBut let's assume it is for the sake of the argument, and we instead have two documents : a transcript of the conversation (with personal info removed), and another stating \"this conversation was done by the vice-principal\".  \n\nThe vice-rector identification falls under GDPR scope (which doesn't mean it's *forbidden* automatically. simply it's personally identifiable data), but the anonymous conversation transcript itself isn't.  \nNow, let's change the identification into \"this is a transcript of a conversation made with a member of the rectorate, recorded outside the school grounds\".  \n\nThe vice-rector would still complain. Because it's not about mishanding of his personal data, it's about an (imagined) breach of privacy while they were making a proof of statements they intended to stay off-the-record. (Plus that there is a proof that he forces students to come on his private house outside school hours...)  \n\n>  if the data processing goes beyond the scope of \"purely personal or household activity\"  \n\nYour remark is right : it's a purely personal activity (especially if it was never shared).

But because some conversions outside the UK and EU are not being counted in Google Ads, the only way to address this situation is to show the Cookie Script consent banner to all my customers around the world, and the consent banner also probably needs to cover most of the landing page, to force an \"Accept\" all cookies or \"Reject\" from the customer (hopefully I can get most customers to \"Accept\" the cookies).\n\nNow my questions is, after you put up a consent banner that took up most of the landing page to force an \"Accept\" all cookies or \"Reject\" it from the customers, how was your bounce rate on your landing page? Did the bounce rate on your landing page increase significantly after you put up a consent banner ?

Sending an email asking customers if they want to opt in to receiving marketing is still classed as marketing and cannot be done unless you comply with the appropriate law. Honda and FlyBe were both fined in 2017 for sending thousands of emails to their mailing lists asking customers if they wanted to consent to marketing (https://www.am-online.com/news/car-manufacturer-news/2017/03/28/honda-fined-over-illegal-marketing-emails).\n\nSo firstly let’s remember that the primary law governing email marketing is not GDPR but is, in fact, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR). And as you can see, it has been around since 2003, so organisations have only had 21 years to start complying with it. Maybe that’s too much to ask…\n\nAnyway, to be more helpful, firstly we need to understand what kind of customers you have. Are you B2B or B2C? \n\nPECR generally doesn’t apply to business contacts, and to over-simplify things a little, you don’t need consent to send marketing emails to them. So if thats your customer base, crack on as you have been doing.\n\nIf you’re B2C on the other hand, you cannot send marketing emails to them without consent (or relying on the soft opt in, which I’m guessing you won’t be able to do as there are certain things you need to do at the point of data collection that I guess you won’t have done).\n\nSo for B2C it boils down to two main options:\n\n1) The pure compliance option would suggest that you immediately cease sending email marketing to any consumers where you cannot demonstrate that you have their consent. You have to build your marketing list up again from scratch, this time collecting the proper consents.\n\n2) The pragmatic, risk-based approach would suggest that if you’ve already been sending them emails and haven’t been getting complaints, they’re probably not unhappy at receiving them. The risk of enforcement action is potentially low. As long as you allow easy opt outs, don’t get too spammy and handle any complaints efficiently and effectively, you might well fly under the radar. But that does rely on the business accepting a level of risk.\n\n(This is not formal legal advice and is not a substitute for getting your own professional advice as an organisation.)",

For example, it might be possible to use some analytics on an opt-out basis under a \"legitimate interest\", especially taking into account the GDPR's flexibility regarding processing personal data for statistical purposes. But I haven't seen this argument being made by any vendors.\n\nWhen reading the marketing of \"GDPR-compliant\" analytics services, it is also important to distinguish two aspects:\n\n* whether the *analytics service* is GDPR-compliant (typically yes, because they'd only act as a data processor)\n* whether *your use* of this analytics service is GDPR-compliant (much more complicated story)\n\nA lot of marketing lacks this important nuance.\n\nBut at the end of the day, if you're deciding between GA versus some other analytics solution that brands itself as \"privacy focused\", it is likely that it will be easier for you to use the non-Google solution in a compliant manner. Not necessarily because it's inherently better, but because you're circumventing the compliance minefield that is the Google Ads ecosystem, and because GA competitors tend to have fewer features that could cause problems.",

                "body": "I find those claims from Plausible to be very misleading. Plausible is a highly privacy-preserving analytics solution, but their misleading claims makes it unnecessarily difficult for Plausible customers to be GDPR compliant.\n\nThe data pipeline looks something like this:\n\n📜 analytics events  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⬇️  \n⚙️ anonymization via hashing  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⬇️  \n📜 anonymous data  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⬇️  \n⚙️ analytics\n\nSo the argument seems to be that there are no GDPR problems because the analytics processing is only performed on anonymous data.\n\n## Anonymization is processing of personal data\n\nMy first problem with this is that this ignores the anonymization processing. Clearly, this is processing of personal data such as IP addresses. Plausible may not be *storing* personal data, but using the Plausible service definitely involves *collecting* and *processing* it. So these claims in their \"DPA\" are factually wrong:\n\n> Even though the purpose of Plausible Analytics is to track the usage of a website, this can still be done without […] collecting or storing any personal data […].\n>\n> By using Plausible Analytics, all the site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously.\n\n## The GDPR concept of personal data\n\nMy second issue is whether that \"anonymized data\" is anonymous within the meaning of the GDPR, particularly Art 4(1) and Recital 26. Personal data is any information that relates to an identifiable person. Data is anonymous if there are no \"means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out\".\n\n1. In Plausible's design, identification remains trivially possible until the \"daily salt\" is discarded. Generating a semi-stable ID so that you can identify whether a visitor is new or recurring is the entire point of this exercise. As long as that salt is available, we can locate the events that relate to a particular IP address / person.\n\n2. Even after that salt is discarded, you can single out a visitor's events within a day. You cannot correlate their records across days though. You don't know the visitor's real-world identity, but this is comparable to cookie based tracking where the visitor is assigned a random ID.\n\n## Pseudonymization as a TOM\n\nSo I think Plausible customers should not consider this data processing \"anonymous\". The more suitable GDPR concepts would be \"pseudonymous data\" (which is still personal data) or data that does not enable identification (which can still be personal data).\n\nThis is great, because pseudonymization is recognized by the GDPR is a recommended Technical and Organizational Measure (TOM) to help with security and compliance, and only keeping non-identifying info relaxes some data subject rights per Art 10.\n\nBut what pseudonymization does not affect is the *lawfulness* of processing per Art 6 GDPR. There will still have to be some legal basis such as consent or legitimate interest.\n\n## The cookie question\n\nMost websites that use analytics will rely on consent, because using cookies (or similar technologies) to access or store information on the user's device requires consent (unless that access/storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user). If no such access/storage is required, then it is likely that a \"legitimate interest\" would be sufficient for analytics.\n\nThe remaining question is whether Plausible actually works without cookie-like technologies. The \"access or storage\" is the important part, *not* the use of a specific mechanism like cookies. Plausible does not do purely server-side analytics. Instead, it expects you to install a JavaScript \"snippet\" on the website, which sends data from the user's device to Plausible servers when certain events happen. [Recent EDPB guidance on the technical scope of the ePrivcy Directive](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-22023-technical-scope-art-53-eprivacy-directive_en) suggests that JavaScript code, tracking pixels, fingerprinting, and query parameters can also be used for access and storage of information, similar to cookies. The ePrivacy conditions apply regardless of whether personal data is involved. Taken together, there is an argument that client-side analytics – including Plausible – require consent.\n\n## Some EU countries are more flexible\n\nWhat I tend to discuss here is a fairly hardline GDPR interpretation that's also in line with the EDPB.\n\nHowever, various national data protection agencies are much more flexible in practice. E.g. the [French CNIL claims that consent may not always be required](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-et-autres-traceurs/regles/cookies-solutions-pour-les-outils-de-mesure-daudience), and offers a list of analytics solutions they've looked at. Plausible is not on that list, but would likely meet or exceed the CNIL standards.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the CNIL interpretation is not covered by applicable EU law, and directly contradicts some prior guidelines. French data controllers might take the gamble to follow these guides, but it would be rather risky in cases where the CNIL is not the relevant supervisory authority.\n\nSimilarly, the Netherlands have an exception for analytics cookies in their laws, but again I fail to see how this can be compliant with EU law.",

Seems like the first definitive answer I’ve received!! \n\n> Transparency and the Right to be Informed\n\n>Employers implementing in-vehicle tracking must also comply with their transparency obligations under the GDPR, and ensure they meet the employee’s right to be informed.5\nAn employee must be informed of the existence of tracking and how it operates as well as being clearly informed of all the purposes for which their personal data is to be used, in advance of any such tracking being implemented. This means that the employer must clearly explain to the employee who is using the vehicle concerned what records are being created, why those records are necessary, what they will be used for, how long they will be kept for, who will have access to them and for what reason.\nIt is critical that employees are made fully aware of the extent of the use of the personal data collected through vehicle tracking. Under no circumstances should an employee be left in a situation in which they are unclear on what information is being collected or the purposes of that tracking. The data collected may not be used for any other purpose, unless that processing is compatible with the original purpose of collection.\nAn employee should receive prior notice and clear and comprehensive information about the type and purpose of the tracking. The Article 29 Working Party (WP29)6 recommended that such information should be displayed prominently in every car, within eyesight of the driver.7 While not compulsory, this may be considered good practice for compliance with transparency requirements.\nEmployers should devise and make available to drivers a policy on the use of vehicle tracking. In the context of the use of vehicle tracking devices, this document should also set out the employer's policy on the use of company vehicles for private use, if private use is permissible.\n\nDefinitely seems like they have breached GDPR here, but what are the potential ramifications or consequences of this?\n\nThey have provided me with this information now, but only after 3 weeks of tracking",

You (not the browser) are sharing information with websites, for specific purposes, but you have no control over what these websites will actually do with your information.\n\nA browser fingerprint is an identifier, just like an IP, email address or cookie can be identifiers. All these identifiers act as a common identifier multiple websites/companies can share and cross reference to know they are all talking about the same person. Then, they can tie to it any other data they have about you and share/sell it however they want. The particularity of a browser fingerprint is that it's way harder to modify/spoof than other types of identifiers:\n- IP: You can use a VPN, reboot your router (some/most routers change your IP if you reboot them).\n- Cookies: You can delete them and most browsers \"sandbox\" them (see third-party cookies).\n- Email address: You can use a throwaway address or just lie if you don't care about receiving emails from that specific website.\n- Browser fingerprint: AFAIK you have to use another browser but there are not a huge amount of them so you will quickly run out of different \"identities\". Some say you even have to use another device, because the fingerprint includes stuff like the resolution of your screen (actually the resolution of the browser window), graphics related stuff tied to your GPU, and so on.",

Now, that said, you can probably slip under the radar and do it anyway.  It's up to you to think through the moral, legal, and compliance aspects of that choice.  My advice is that, if you wish to sell into the EU, you obey their rules.\n\nThere are 3 components to all of this ad stuff:\n\n1 - GDPR is a set of privacy laws that govern sharing info with 3rd parties, such as Google.\n\n2 - ePrivacy is a set of laws controlling the storing of essentially any information on any device of an end user.  That includes cookies, etags, or even info put as params into urls.\n\n3 - country-specific marketing laws.\n\n\nSo, an analysis:\n\neprivacy says you must ask consent for storage of any info not required for basic functionality.  If you use something for 2 purposes, you must ask consent.  So you can use a cookie or other local storage for shopping carts, but you musk ask consent for analytics or ads.  The case law is very clear, and iirc, microsoft got in trouble on this: if you use a eg a functionality cookie, such as a shopping cart cookie, to also do analytics or ads, you then must consent it.\n\ngdpr says you have only a handful of allowed reasons (basis) to process personal data.  The only one that really works for ads is consent.\n\nIn any case: you can take your own decision on doing this legally or not, but the vendors saying you can do these things w/o consent are not being honest with you.",

It is entirely determined by the insurance company.\n\nThe Guideline even gave an example of this:\n\n>Example: Bank payments   \n>  \n>As part of the instructions from Employer A, the payroll administration transmits information to Bank B so that they can carry out the actual payment to the employees of Employer A. This activity includes processing of personal data by Bank B which it carries out for the purpose of performing banking activity. Within this activity, the bank decides independently from Employer A on which data that have to be processed to provide the service, for how long the data must be stored etc. Employer A cannot have any influence on the purpose and means of Bank B’s processing of data. Bank B is therefore to be seen as a controller for this processing and the transmission of personal data from the payroll administration is to be regarded as a disclosure of information between two controllers, from Employer A to Bank B.\n\nRegarding your example of an online store, the online store would be considered a data controller, i dont know where you get the idea that it was a data processor.\n\nThink about the issue from a logical standpoint, if your reasoning is correct, all service providers would be data processor and the majority of the data controller would be customers. In which case, the GDPR would become essentially useless because all of the processing obligations would be on the customers since controllers are responsible for the processing of the processors. The service providers would essentially have no responsibilities while the customers would have to carry the burden of compliance. No one in their right mind would design such a flawed system.\n\nOn a more practical note, you can go and read the privacy notice of any insurance, social media, e-commerce, delivery company, they would all identify themselves as data controllers. If they were processors, they would not need the privacy notice at all since they are processing on behalf of others.\n\nOn your point regarding fulfilling legal obligations, the insurance company has no obligation to sign the insurance policy with the policy holder. Them not engaging in the contract is not illegal. Fulfilling legal obligations only applies if they are legally required to process such information. In this case, the processing of the data is necessary because they engaged in a contract which they were not obligated to.",

Doing some more digging, I stand corrected; the insurance company in this situation is a data controller and cannot use the household exemption (My background is more in the B2B context where companies are providing each another personal data for processing, vs. a B2C situation where a consumer is providing a business personal information directly).\n\n[Practical Law has guidance surrounding beneficiaries](https://www.serlecourt.co.uk/images/uploads/documents/Suzanne_Rab_-_Practical_Law_-_GDPR_implications.pdf) for trustees and personal representatives that may be applicable (although not directly related to insurance, there are some similarities).  They indicate that the most relevant grounds for processing their personal data is a legal one (I've omitted the legitimate interest consideration as you stated that it does not apply in your country).  So I would check your country's estate and insurance/financial laws surrounding identifying a beneficiary (no one is forcing the parties to enter a contract, but it looks like if they wish to enter into one the legally need to identify a beneficiary)\n\n>In most cases, personal data about beneficiaries will be supplied by the settlor or testator or gathered without\r beneficiary consent. Consent is therefore unlikely to be a ground that could be used by trustees and PRs. Also, if\r consent to processing is relied on, additional obligations will apply to the data controller and beneficiaries will\r have additional rights including a right to withdraw the consent so that data can no longer be processed, data\r portability rights and the right to have the personal data erased.  \n>  \n>\rThe most relevant legal ground for processing personal data is likely to be that trustees and PRs are legally obliged\r to hold information about the beneficiaries (and, conceivably, other family members or individuals who had a\r relationship with the settlor or testator) as part of their duties in running the trust or administering the estate.\r \n\nAs for having secret beneficiaries there appears to be some case law that supports limited disclosure\n\n>The GDPR makes a distinction between data provided by the data subject and data provided by someone else\r (such as a settlor or testator). Where data has been provided by someone other than the beneficiary, trustees and\r PRs may be able to rely on confidentiality obligations owed to the settlor, testator or other beneficiaries to limit\r what they disclose (Article 14(5)(b) and (d), GDPR). However, the court’s approach to this limitation under the GDPR\r is uncertain (Dawson-Darmer v Taylor Wessing LLP).   \n>  \n>Notably, the Data Protection Bill 2017-2019 includes an exemption from the GDPR obligation to provide data subjects with information about personal data that is processed (see Privacy notices) where a claim for legal professional privilege could be maintained in legal proceedings (paragraph 17, Schedule 2, Data Protection Bill 2017- 2019).",

They are asking for the information to complete/fulfill the policy that is being purchased (the contract).  The policy holder is determining/specifying how the insurance company is to use the personal information (for the purpose of providing an insurance policy).   Guideline 07/2020 says that the controller defines \"key elements\" but that does not necessarily mean that the controller determines specifically what personal data needs to be provided to the processor.  The processors often ask for the personal data that is necessary to fulfill the policy/contract being purchased (because the controller often does not know in advance).  Consider an an online store - the purchaser does not get to define what data is required to provide to the store to fulfill the purchase - the online store determines this and they would still be considered a processor with the information they are collecting from the purchaser.  If the online store was going to use the information outside of fulfilling a purchase, then they would be considered a controller.\n\nA processor is defined in the guideline as \"a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.  In the insurance scenario, that information is coming from the controller (the policy holder), and being provided to the insurance company for processing.\n\nAn insurance company asking for beneficiary information from the policy holder (the controller), is likely doing so to fulfil a legal obligation (there is probably a regulation that stipulates that a beneficiary needs to be identified for an insurance policy to be valid).",

So there's some motivation to get it right, especially if you don't have legal team behind you.\n\n\nIn my opinion, proving content through solid processes should be good enough. That is, if you can show that you could have only sent a push message if the user consented, that should work.\n\n\nHowever, there are also opinions – including by some data protection authorities – that this is not enough. In this line of thinking, you shouldn't just be able to show that data subjects in general would have consented, but more precisely when this specific data subject consented to what exactly.\n\n\nSystems implemented along these lines keep an audit log of all consent/withdrawal events. The user-facing part is that the relevant privacy settings wouldn't just show something like \"revoke permission\", but often also show the exact time when that permission was given. I have rarely seen this in apps, but occasionally in cookie consent tools.\n\n\nRelying on operating system permissions can also be problematic because the OS'es settings might not be sufficient to obtain valid consent. For example, consent must be opt-in and specific for a purpose, but permissions might have been enabled by default. Consent also requires transparent information and information on how to withdraw consent, but this may be absent in an OS popup.",

It's hard for the online shop owner (client in this diagram) to state that this cookie is required for the website to operate. However by classifying that way it's depriving the marketer (me in the diagram) of the information they need to provide their services. Arguably the marketing services are required in order for the shop's business to survive.\n\nDoes this change if the specific technology of cookies were not involved? In that case is consent perhaps the wrong legal basis to be thinking about?  \n  \nAny thoughts, or pointers on where to read more much appreciated.

Whether you can prove that them transferring access is a breach of your rights would depend on the terms on which they provided you with access in the first place, which is why I ask about any paper trail/policy statement.  Their argument would be that access to the Gdrive is intended for work-related data and anything that you store in there that does not meet that criteria is either \"at your own risk\" or even becomes the property of the company by dint of you choosing to keep it there.  Equally there might be something in another policy (ie a confidentiality policy or data protection policy) which references general terms about use of company equipment/facilities.   \nTheir position is kind of weakened if they have never laid down anywhere these terms explicitly.  \n\nSeems the most likely outcome here is that your complaint will lead to specific documents being returned to you that you feel should not have been taken away and they will (ideally) amend their working processes - but the latter ceases to be your problem when you leave.  \n  \nI think if I chose to keep things on a work drive that was not related to work I would be unsurprised if I lost access to them when my work relationship ended with that company (or even when it was about to end, as in your case).

In these cases, few personal data rights, if any, are to be granted.\n* Vital Interest (of the data subject): medical records may be transferred in urgency from a hospital to an emergency care unit without waiting for the consent of the involved person.\n* Legal Compliance (of the controller): to keep accurate accounting records a company needs to keep on file who it has done business with, and the data subject may not object to this usage, nor to the needed information being forwarded to public administrations.\n* Contractual requirement (between subject and controller): an online service provider hosts some of your personal data. You can’t ask for erasure of all this data while the contract holds. Termination of the contract has to come first.\n* Legitimate Interest: when there is a minimal impact on the individual’s rights and the individual should reasonably expect that their data is being stored, there can be an exemption from obtaining explicit consent. Website cookies that are used to maintain navigation history visible on the page during a session, for convenience and not to track the user for other purposes, may fit this category, for instance. Scientific research may also be considered a legitimate interest, in particular when the intent is purely epistemic and/or line of responsibilities are clearly stated (independence). Finally, an entity may maintain a database of individuals having committed unethical, non-deontological conduct under this reason for processing, as the ACM proposes to do with its ethics violations database.\n* Consent: all personal data storage and processing that does not fit in the above categories must require the explicit and informed consent of the individual, and this consent must be recorded. The full rights of individuals over their personal data, as described above, are applicable. Of note, this is the default category all processing fit in: unless you have a good motivation your processing belongs to one of the above category, you will be required to request consent from your user. \n\n\nThere seems to be 2 categories that could fit your requirement of not seeking for consent: contractual requirement (if you have a contract with your users to provide a specific service) and legitimate interest, which is a \"catchall\" category. To use the legitimate interest argument, you have to balance the risks of privacy violation of your users with the service provided. Also consider: are your users/clients natural persons or enterprises? The GDPR only applies to natural persons. With enterprises, you enter the terms of contract law.",

The GDPR explains its concept of anonymization vs identification in Recital 26. Anonymization is achieved when you no longer have reasonable means to identify data subjects, not even when using additional data or with help from third parties. A typical example of identication would be that you could find those crash reports that relate to a particular user, or if you can figure out whether two crash reports relate to the same or different users (\"singling out\"). You probably have identifiers such as session IDs that allow you to single out a data subject, or allow correlation with other identifying data that you have.\n\nIn practice, it is much more straightforward to treat crash reports as personal data, and to select an appropriate legal basis.\n\n> If not, then every single HTTP request that doesn't go immediately to a Controller-owned server would require a legal basis.\n\nWell yes, kinda. You need a legal basis for all data processing activities that you control. Taking into account the *Fashion ID* case, that would include causing the user's browser to send requests to some server.\n\nTypically this is quite unproblematic because those servers will be run by your data processors. The GDPR allows you to outsource everything about your processing activities, except your responsibility. You do not need a legal basis for engaging a processor. There is no legal distinction between a physical server that you manage yourself in your basement versus a server that a data processor manages on your behalf.\n\nWhere things get tricky is if you use services that are not your data processor, but independent controllers. That can be legal, but you better have a good legal basis that authorizes this data sharing. An infamous example was the \"Google Fonts\" case. Google Fonts does not offer a DPA, so has to be treated as another controller. In that case, a court found that it was not *necessary* for a legitimate interest to use Google Fonts, at least for the website in question. Necessity is a key component of all Art 6(1) GDPR legal basis other than consent.",

Because Wordpress has Guestmode enabled, it sets the cookie _lscache_vary, which records whether a visitor is logged in, and if not, it serves them a cached page.\n\nIs this a \"strictly necessary cookie\"? Probably not, as I can disable Guestmode, with the only difference being that the site gets slower because I can't use cached pages. As far as I can see, that means that **I am not allowed to cache pages until I've asked for consent**, which means that I'll have to use slow, non-cached pages for every new visitor. Have I understood that correctly?\n\nThen Vimeo sets the Cloudflare Bot Management cookie __cf_bm, which records whether the user is a human or a bot. This one... **might** be strictly necessary? I don't think there's anything I can do to stop the cookie from being written if I want Vimeo to work, in any case.\n\nSome other Vimeo and Wordpress cookies are set if the visitor logs in (a test cookie, and one that stores account details) or plays a video (preferences and Vimeo usage history cookies). I'm guessing these might all count as \"strictly necessary\" for their respective uses?\n\nSo what if the user clicks \"reject all\" on the cookie banner? What do I do then? Nothing at all, because all the remaning cookies are strictly necessary? Or does that mean that I can skip the banner entirely?\n\nAlternatively, if the Vimeo usage history cookie doesn't count as \"strictly necessary\", do I have to record their answer and block them from watching videos? Or try to figure out some way to stop Vimeo from storing usage history?\n\nI'm confused.",

In particular, necessity must be viewed from the user's perspective. For example, advertising-related cookies might be necessary for a website's business model, but they are not necessary to show that page right now.\n\nOn the other hand, this provision is commonly interpreted a bit more widely. In particular, security measures cannot be optional, they are strictly necessary for the service as a whole to work. Similarly, some degree of caching is probably necessary, and sometimes cookies are needed for that.\n\nInstead of thinking about this as a choice between \"allow all\" and \"reject all\", a more compliant viewpoint would be the three choices \"allow all\", \"customize\", and \"necessary only\".\n\nWhen embedding third party content on your pages, cookies are only part of the issue. The mere act of causing the browser to load that third-party content discloses personal data to that third party, and thus requires a legal basis. Common solutions are:\n\n* The third party is contractually bound to perform some service on your behalf, and will not use your user's data for other purposes.\n* Embedding the content is necessary, e.g. to fulfil your contract with the user or to meet a legitimate interest (this is similar to but weaker than the \"strictly necessary\" standard for cookies).\n* The user gave their consent.\n\nIn many cases, consent is the appropriate choice. This doesn't have to be part of your consent banners that primarily discuss cookies, though it can be. In case no consent has been given (yet), the embedded content might be replaced by a placeholder that asks for consent. Once consent is given, the placeholder is replaced by the actual content. I commonly see this for embedded Youtube videos, social media posts, or maps. This is a great way to ask for consent because the benefit is obvious to the user, and you can use the consent request to explain potential problems (e.g. cookies that the embed provider will set).\n\nVimeo is interesting because it might act either as a video content delivery network that is your data processor, or like a video sharing platform where embedding would likely require consent.\n\nLoading Stripe is probably necessary for the purpose of entering into a contract, but only on your checkout pages – not on other pages.",

But regarding the Stripe and Vimeo cookies: Let's assume that some of these cookies count as functional cookies and not \"strictly necessary\" ones.\n\nWhat should I do if a visitor clicks \"reject all\" on the cookie banner? I don't really have a say in how Vimeo and Stripe are integrated into my page – for these kinds of services, you typically include some existing Javascript code that is provided to you. \n\nFor example, allowing the users to pay without fraud prevention (as provided by the cookie) sounds insane. And I'm not sure I'd even be able to rewrite Vimeo's scripts to show videos without saving preferences as cookies, or rewrite Stripe's scripts so that users can go to payment-related pages without the fraud prevention cookie being added. **So would I be obliged to block large parts of the site for users who reject all cookies?**\n\nI'm also still confused about the \"strictly necessary\" concept. If a site contains different pages, some with only text, others with videos, and a cookie is strictly necessary for showing videos but not for displaying text, then would the video cookie actually be \"strictly necessary\"? Some users might visit the site without watching a single video. \n\nAs an aside, on Vimeo's site, it says:\n\n> For embedded videos, all ‘non-essential’ cookies have been removed from the Vimeo Player. Any remaining cookies are characterized as ‘essential’ for the operation of our streaming video player.\n\n> Because we cannot provide legal advice, it is your responsibility to determine if obtaining specific consent from your end users is necessary for the essential cookies deployed through an embedded player on your website",

Since their handling of data will happen, there isn’t much alternative: maybe just offer reaching you via email for finding other payment options? Low chances this will happen though;) Otherwise it looks like Stripe cookies are strictly necessary for you to deliver payment (part of your offering).\n\nVimeo seems extra, so ideally it would show up only to those, who accepted additional tracking. Typically cookie solutions (CMP) offer ways to integrate consumer’s consent with showing /not of a plugin. Maybe WP as well? \nBut if not, keep under strictly and have anyone saying there was no other technical way. \n\nAll above, you probably will cover in Privacy Policy.

In that case you need to write a balancing test. Something like why this stuff is good for your company and why is it bad for the customer, why are your companies rights better and how you minimize the damage the data processing causes. It is not that hard, but you need to find a few examples first to know how it should look like. Another ground that you have a contract with the customer and that fraud prevention cookie is required to fulfill the contract. In the case of webshops I think this latter is a lot more common because you have a contract before payment.",

They basically provide that either the ’user’ (the person using the ISS) or the subscriber (the person who has a contract with the internet service provider) must consent to the setting of cookies and similar technologies on the equipment (desktop computer, laptop, mobile device etc) being used. This is not quite the same as consenting to the processing of personal data in UK GDPR terms. **However, it remains the case that for consent to be valid the person providing it must understand what they are consenting to.** This means that you need to take proportionate measures, taking into account the risks inherent in technology being used, **to ensure that a child providing their own consent is competent to do so.** Further information on what this means in practice will be provided when our guidance on cookies is updated.\n\nIt has been argued that certain age verification schemes (like a check-box that says you're over a certain age) is not adequate for determining if someone is of the proper age.  So if you are confident with your age verification scheme then theoretically you can put the two together so long as its clear.  If the consent is for marketing, that option needs to turned off and based on what is happening with Meta, you are unlikely able to force targeted advertising (especially if it's children).",

In other words, is it still compliant even if you do not allow people to receive the lead magnet/download if they don’t click the button/checkbox for consent?\n\nTo clarify, the checkbox would not be pre checked, but checking the box would be a condition of receiving the lead magnet.",

It says that consent is required when:\n\n* accessing or storing information on the end user's device, unless that access/storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user, or when\n\n* using non-anonymized traffic data for purposes other than performing the transmission.\n\nNote that the purpose is decisive, not the data itself. For the access/storage case, it doesn't even matter if the information is personal data.\n\nThere is an old WP29 document from 2014 that argues that basically any use of JavaScript APIs in the browser can require consent, because use of such APIs implies access to information on the end user's device.\n\nSo if you need to access the user agent string or JavaScript APIs in order to display the site properly, that is going to be perfectly fine without consent. For example, if you want to serve a fallback site for Internet Explorer users, or to change the page layout when the window is less than 600px wide.\n\nBut if you access the same information for a different purpose that is not strictly necessary, then you're going to need consent. Analytics are not strictly necessary.\n\nSo under a strict reading of the ePD, the only way to run analytics without consent is to use anonymized traffic data, without client-side data collection. That traffic data may or may not involve using the user-agent HTTP header, though by itself the user agent string might not be quite anonymous.\n\nThe ePD is of course insane because it leaves no middle ground between “strictly necessary” and “consent”. Notably, it lacks a concept of “legitimate interest”. This has been lamented since about a decade, but the proposed ePrivacy Regulation still hasn't been passed (any year now…).",

Unfortunately the consent field defaults to \"false\" so in reality there's no way for us to know exactly who simply wasn't asked and who legitimately said no.\n\nSo what I'm asking is, can we use the data?

In short, data that has been properly anonymized is not subject to the GDPR - but you have to be careful that it has been properly anonymized, and not just pseudonymised (there's a section on this too). \n\n[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/#pd5](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/#pd5)\n\nBTW - just want to clarify something with the whole consent thing. When you say \"obviously asking for consent to process that data would be appropriate\" - this is the case if you're asking for special category data (ethnicity would count as this), as there's no other lawful basis or Article 9 exemption that you could rely on, but if you're only asking for normal personal data (name, email, address etc, and no special category data) then you could most probably rely on Article 6(1)(f) - legitimate interests. It's usually the case that market research/customer satisfaction surveys etc. with the purpose of helping to improve a business's services can fall under this legitimate interests basis. You therefore wouldn't need to ask for consent at all, but would obviously still need to provide a privacy policy setting out to the data subject exactly what you'll be doing with their personal data. It might be an easier way to do it (if you don't need special category data) - as the issue with asking for consent is that there is way more to GDPR consent than the normal notion of consent in every day life. It has to be specific, informed, unambiguous, opt-in, clear language, evidenced, freely given (the data subject can't suffer any detriment if they don't give it) and has to be able to be withdrawn as easily as it was given.

Fewer people know that it's actually the ePrivacy directive, that it is entirely technology-neutral, and that its rules on accessing and storing information on the end users device are much more relevant for mobile or desktop apps.\n\nWhen a mobile app developer thinks about consent, it's likely related to app permission system from the operating system, e.g. access to location/microphone/camera/contacts.\n\nPart of it is technical also. The web is an extraordinarily transparent platform. It is easy for users and regulators to see what a website is doing, and much more difficult to inspect an app.\n\nTo inspect an app, I need to sign up for some app store, and then decompile the app, or run it on a jailbroken device. Due to certificate pinning it might be impossible to inspect traffic flows – TLS only leaves the destination IP/domain visible. All of this is difficult.\n\nTo inspect a website, I just open the website and can use the browser's built-in features to see what it is doing (e.g. F12/devtools). I can easily log the exact requests and inspect the payloads, without having to circumvent certificate pinning. I can easily see what data has been stored by the website. There are tracking blockers that automate this traffic analysis and can alert the user.\n\nBtw the relative lack of mobile tracking blockers means that apps are much more valuable to ad-driven companies than their websites. For example, Reddit's mobile website is pretty awful, and clearly designed to push users to their app where they can show ads without interference. Were it not for this tracking (and for Apple's/Safari's opposition to support Progressive Web Apps), there would be little reason for most native apps to exist.",

This applies even if the cookie is anonymous, such as analytics.\n\nSession vs persistent has no bearing on the issue.\n\nIt’s worth remembering that this isn’t really a GDPR issue. In the UK, this is covered by the Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003 Regulations, as amended in 2019. These were enacted as a result of an EU directive and have not been repealed. Equivalent legislation has obviously been implemented in EU countries.\n\nThe reason it is a separate consideration is because it goes further than the GDPR. Rather than needing to gain consent to process personal data, what you are asking consent for is to store or access information (i.e. cookies) on a person’s device. The information might be anonymous. This makes no difference. \n\nIf the type of cookie is exempt from the regulations, you would THEN consider whether the GDPR applies. It only would if the cookies store or access personal data. Note that a person’s IP address is often deemed to be personal data. You would then have the option to consider using legal bases other than consent, such as legitimate interests.",

The ePD is implemented in each countries national laws, so there can be small differences. However, the ePD doesn't care about whether the cookies contain personal data. It's not even specific to cookies: any access to or storage of information on the end user's device requires consent, unless that access or storage is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user.\n\nAnalytics were not explicitly requested by the user. They are not strictly necessary for the website to work. Thus, even allegedly-anonymous first-party analytics cookies require consent.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the cookie consent issue was never the problem with Google Analytics. It is a data quality problem because you can't see users that didn't give consent, but it's not necessarily a compliance issue. GA cookies are also set as first-party cookies. That GA fails to be GDPR-compliant has much more to do with data transfers into the United States.\n\nBecause some users might not give consent to analytics, there is an interest in cookie-less analytics. Or more precisely, analytics that don't require consent under European rules. The most straightforward way to achieve this is to do server-side analytics that do not collect additional data beyond what is technically necessary. However, this strongly limits what you can see. Counting pageviews is easy, but estimating unique users is challenging without doing invasive fingerprinting that would raise GDPR concerns again.",

GDPR itself is the same everywhere, and the GDPR makes it very clear where and how your national laws could deviate.\n\nThe entire point of EU law such as Directives and Regulations is to create a Single Market where you only have to deal with a single set of rules (the ones in your home country), not 27+3 different rules depending on where customers/users are from.\n\nThe Dutch exemption on analytics cookies is potentially invalid, because the ePrivacy Directive does not afford member states any leeway to add further exceptions to the consent requirement. The ePrivacy cookie consent requirement is independent from the concept of GDPR legal basis, so the Dutch DPA's suggestion of a \"legitimate interest\" for analytical cookies looks objectively wrong to me. In any case, read the Dutch guidelines here: https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/onderwerpen/internet-telefoon-tv-en-post/cookies\n\nSimilarly, the German law providing a similar exemption was rather dubious since the relevant rules appeared in the ePrivacy directive, especially since GDPR clarified the definition of consent.

My understanding is that under the ePrivacy Directive, this still requires cookie consent, as it is data stored on the user's terminal device.\n\nSecond, the hashing inputs do not include hostname. This allows tracking users across different websites without a direct hand-off, something which is not possible with the first-party cookies used by Google Analytics. This is, in one particular respect, more invasive than regular tracking that relies on first-party cookies. I believe it may also put you at greater risk for CCPA. \n\nI also don't think there's a strong value proposition in preventing third-party providers from linking an identifier to a data subject. They're Processors/Service Providers. They are contractually and legally obligated not to attempt to identify data subjects except under the Controller's direction. What threat model is this protecting against? And, more to the point, why does that threat model *not include you*, another third-party service provider processing the same data?\n\nI have some concerns that this doesn't actually count as anonymization under GDPR and/or CCPA. You're over-focusing on the ability to tie the identifier back to the identity. But you're still building a profile on a user and tying those data points together, which can still be personal data if the profile is rich enough. The boundaries of that are still untested. \n\nFrom a pragmatic view, destroying the data every 24 hours means no data on repeat visitors or long-term engagement. That's going to kill a lot of use cases for Google Analytics. I'll be the first to tell you that 90% of the features don't get used by most people, but that's a big one that's widely considered one of the basic fundamentals.",

It also comforts us that being open and transparent can benefit both the community and us.\n\nVerifying claims and, more generally, trusting third-party services, if not dogmatic, is certainly a matter of communication, certification, transparency, and time. I can't argue this point.\n\nWe consider that the entropy provided by the /dev/urandom of AWS Lambda is not sufficient as far as the security of our customers is concerned and thus do prefer to rely on industrial-strength sources. \n\nWe claim publicly on our website that we forward to Google Analytics a \"cryptographically secure pseudorandom identifier (**generated from** a minimum of 384-bits of entropy)\". In other words, we are talking about the randomness of generated IDs (guaranteed by at least 384 bits of entropy) and not about their lengths. Also, we don't see any argument in favor of generating random IDs larger than 128bit.\n\nConcerning Kinesis, the MD5 hash used for the partition key is not about security but about partitioning and distributing data in the Kinesis shards for load balancing purposes. Furthermore, this hash's security is out of scope as **we store the actual data in Kinesis**.\n\nWe claim publicly on our website that \"anything at **rest** uses AES-256 GCM **encryption**\". It concerns data stored in Kinesis. In other words, the security of data in Kinesis is guaranteed by symmetric encryption and not by hash algorithms. Please be aware that we provide a multi-part data processing pipeline, and the security of the approach relies on multiple complementary aspects. It should not be reduced to simple hashing algorithms. \n\nConcerning Dynamodb, we use a keyed hashing algorithm with a 32 bytes key generated randomly from at least 384 bits of entropy. There is nothing even vaguely foreseeable with the current state of arts, including quantum computers, able to brute force this hash. Note however that the IDs stored in DynamoDB are also encrypted at rest using AES-256 GCM encryption.\n\nWhat is really interesting, though, is that we don't even count on the security of the hashes in DynamoDB to guarantee that forwarded IDs are secure and anonymous. We actually count on a well simpler mechanism. We destroy information. The id sent to Google Analytics is random and doesn't carry any bit of relevant information.\n\nConcerning the linkability, we also publicly claim that we map the IID to OID and destroy the mapping after 24h. This is how we maintain the fundamental building blocks of Google Analytics (e.g., sessions, visitors, etc.). The true anonymization will be achieved after 24h; thank you for pointing that out; this is the core feature we are providing. After 24h, and as long as the data exists in Google Analytics, individuals are completely anonymous. During 24h, they are pseudo-anonymous, and as per recital 26 of GDPR, there is no means reasonably likely to be used to identify the actual individual neither. \n\nNevertheless, you have discovered a bug regarding the \"real\" TTL of a mapping in the worst case, where data can potentially remain in Kinesis during the maximum amount of 24h due to a technical consumption problem downstream and therefore added to the 24h of DynamoDB. We have already provided a [patch](https://github.com/priveraio/privera/commit/597b539). I have also thanked you in the commit message for having reported this issue, even though this process could have been simpler if reported directly on GitHub.\n\nA quick note concerning the 15min in the 24h15min of TTL. Note that the mapping is effectively destroyed after 24h as we change the hash key exactly after 24h; the TTL only concerns a technical point of how we need to drain the database. As far as security is concerned, we cannot compute the same hash anymore after exactly 24h.\n\nOne more time. Thank you very much for having expressed your concerns.

                "body": "Thank you so much for your thoughtful feedback.\n\nLet's summarize some fundamental aspects of the project as I see some misunderstanding about what's happening under the hood.\n\nFirst, apart from the identification part (hold on), we do not store any data at all. For instance, when we receive let say the title and the URL of the page, this data is not stored by us and is forwarded to the downstream service provider. We do not create any kind of profile, etc.\n\nNow, let's talk identity. \n\nThe hash includes the IP, the UA, and the API key. This API key is, for now, the UA property ID that serves as a \"silo\" id to separate data of the same user across websites. We can push it further, but without going into deep details here, it is the data controller's responsibility to fix the limit of the \"range\" of the identity of its users, and for now, it is tied to the property ID.\n\nThen, you \"don't think there's a strong value proposition in preventing third-party providers from linking an identifier to a data subject\" (the anonymization process from the processor's point of view). But you also see only half of the value proposition. In effect, we also prevent the data controller from linking a data subject to its data (the anonymization process from the controller's point of view). \n\nTo explain in more detail the identification process, you must also understand that this is a one-way process. And that's where its strength resides. As I said earlier, we do not store any PII, which means we store neither the IP nor the UA. So how it works? We hash the (IP, UA, API KEY) cryptographically and store the result (for 24h, but hold on). So if I give you a dump of the database or throw it in public today, it is implausible you can extract anything meaningful and certainly not the IP or the UA. But we go even further because what may be true today may change tomorrow. So we map this strong id to a random one. This way, we are literally \"destroying\" the underlying data. So even in the future, if someone has access to your data in your GA account, he literally can't retrieve any PII. But wait, now we, the proxy, become the bottleneck. That's where the 24h comes in. To mitigate any risks of data-breach, nothing lasts for more than 24h in our infrastructure. \n\nThe 24h has another side effect. We cannot track the same user's identity across days. Even though I can understand that your position may be different, we consider this a feature for individuals. This is an ideological standpoint and, as such, can be open to interpretation. However, we firmly think that we have to balance respecting users' privacy and conducting business efficiently. The 24h limit, we think, is the right balance. \n\nTo really summarize (my pretty dense answer). \n\nWe do not store PII. We are compliant with GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, etc. Our sole value proposition (sorry for the minimalism) is to make individuals completely anonymous while not breaking your GA.",

This is a crucial distinction when it comes to proving that reidentification is impossible.\n\n\\- It is \"not possible\" to use GA without cookies. The loss of data quality you are talking about is in effect total. By removing the cookie, you are basically destroying the notion of visitor and thus destroying anything useful GA may be able to provide you.\n\n\\- If you run any fingerprinting process (active and browser-side or passive and server-side, you are swapping the cookie by another even stronger identity. And as long as you can retrieve this identity (by running your fingerprinting script at the next visit or by sending the id to GA) , then you fall in GDPR because you can reidentify a living individual. This is the most important feature we are providing. The anonymity of the user with regards to you, to GA, and even to us as we do not store anything that allows linking back to a living individual. \n\n\\- If a site operator considers self-hosting the CE, then you are doing well because you are providing the same kind of anonymization as us. The only difference is that in our CE the anonymization process does not rely on a strong entropy source while our saas version does. Using Matomo is different and complementary. We do not store or provide any statistics, we only provide anonymization. So you still need a service provider (GA, Matomo, etc). For now, we are launching with GA but we are also intending to add more providers in the future. You will be able to benefit from the wealth of functionalities of your provider of choice while ensuring anonymity and going out of the GDPR.\n\n\\- Your skepticism about the algorithm is understandable as I you're not yet :) used to its internals.

We are \"key\" hashing a tuple composed of IP (low entropy), User agent (let say medium entropy), API key (let say low entropy) with a key of a minimum of 384 bits of entropy (let say OK). By design, this doesn't allow anyone in the current living world to make a brute force (actually a rainbow table) attack on this hash. But let say that it is possible in a post-quantum world! To even mitigate this risk, we are swapping the hash by a minimum of 384 bits of entropy random id that we forward to GA. So in any world at any time now or in the future, no one would be even able to do anything with this id. It is random and doesn't encode any data. Hope you're no more skeptical.",

And as the GDPR is some kind of fuzzy about this subject, let's focus on the upcoming ePrivacy.\n\nThe ePrivacy Directive (EPD) eventual replacement, the ePrivacy Regulation (EPR), will build upon the EPD and expand its definition. The proposed regulation has some key changes of interest here:\n\n\\- Browser fingerprinting: The rules on cookies will also apply to “browser fingerprinting”, a process that seeks to uniquely identify users based on their browser configuration. (IP and user-agent being considered as \"passive\" browser fingerprinting)\n\n\\- Limited exception for analytics: There will be an exemption for website analytics, recognizing that this is not an intrusive activity. However, it will only apply to analytics carried out by the website provider. It is not clear if third-party analytic cookies, like Google Analytics, will benefit from this exemption.\n\nTakeaways: User-agent + IP is a kind of cookie.\n\nIn Opinion 01/2017, Article 29 Working party (“WP29”) clarified that cookies are exempted from the requirement of express and informed consent by considering \"first party analytics cookies are not likely to create a privacy risk when they are strictly limited to first-party aggregated statistical purposes and anonymized.\n\nTakeaways: User-agent + IP does not require consent if used for statistics and anonymized.\n\nYou may now wonder why using Privera. After all, as per the above explanations, and should the revision of the EPR be deemed appropriate, express and informed consent will not be required for first-party analytics?\n\nThe question is whether GA can be considered as an aggregated statistics and first-party analytics service? And it is all about anonymization.\n\nYou (the data controller) and GA (the data processor) are still able to \"identify\" individuals. A very concrete example is your capacity to single out users by some predicate and then use its cookie id (the \"cid\" that is available in clear in GA) to retarget the same user the next time he comes back to your website (as you also have the same cid as a first-party cookie on your website). Clearly, the user is not anonymous and you fall under the regulation (I'm not even talking about possibilities for Google to be able to reidentify users).\n\nNow with Privera, you are guaranteed to not be able to identify individuals as you don't have access to the way the hash of IP+ua is mapped to the \"cid\" you will find in your GA (and vice versa for GA). Moreover and as explained in another comment, we do not store any data neither and we cannot even rebuild the hash or find its mapping to the random cid as we destroy everything after 24h.\n\nThat is what we are all about here: providing anonymity. Getting rid of the cookie is the icing on the cake :).",

Personally, HSMs are overkill for this use case.\n\nIn the open source/CE edition, you're using a cryptographically secure RNG (e.g. /dev/urandom on Linux), so that is truly secure as far as I am concerned for the ID passed to GA. This OID uses 128 bits which is totally sufficient in this context, though quite far from the claimed 384 bits of security.\n\nIt is worth noting that various intermediate IDs are created for storage in various Amazon services, in particular DynamodDB and Kinesis. These IDs are substantially weaker (e.g. due to use of MD5 or non-cryptographic RNGs for deriving keys), and these IDs can be linked with the secure OID. As long as this linkability exists, it would be unwise to assume that the OID were actually anonymized. The IID–OID association has a TTL, so that true anonymization will be achieved after 24h 15min elapse since the Kinesis event is processed. The events may be pending in Kinesis for 24 hours, so that there might be up to 50 hours between the user's visit event and the onset of anonymization.",

While the resulting data in GA might still allow singling out in *some* cases using contextual information, your OID is an exceptionally strong form of anonymization. The 128 bits are more than enough.\n* My concerns about the IID generation do not impact the security of the overall scheme, under the assumption that the Proxy (and AWS) is trustworthy.\n* You provide clear arguments for the technical security of the scheme, though I don't necessarily agree with the details.\n\nI am somewhat confused though by the IID key, which you claim is inaccessible after 24 hours. In the dispatcher's Handle() method for the CE, I see the following code.\n\n\tseedh := sha256.New()\n\tio.WriteString(seedh, functionName)\n\tio.WriteString(seedh, time.Now().UTC().Format(\"2006-01-02\"))\n\thrand := mrand.New(mrand.NewSource(int64(binary.BigEndian.Uint64(seedh.Sum(nil)))))\n\tvar hkey [32]byte\n\t_, err := hrand.Read(hkey[:])\n\n* the `functionName` is known by the operator and is likely guessable\n* the YYYY-MM-DD date is predictable, and can be reconstructed at a later date (so the IID hash *can* be recomputed after 24 hours!)\n* `seedh.Sum(nil)` is a 256-bit hash\n* `int64(...)` extracts 64 bits from this\n* the 64-bit seed is used for a mathematical RNG, which is [remarkably poor and unusual](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21835) even for PRNGs of its class\n* 32 bytes (256 bits) are deterministically extracted from this RNG\n\nIt seems that the detour with mrand weakens the key to 64 bits, and this detour can be removed entirely. Also, the entropy is likely much lower than 64 bits as the function name + date are somewhat predictable. But again: this doesn't impact the security of this scheme. In principle, the whole IID concept could be removed entirely since you and your storage are trustworthy by definition – simply using `IID = sha256(IP + UA + YYYYMMDD)` as a lookup key for the current OID would have almost identical security properties to your current solution, and you might not even need a cryptographic hash function.\n\nI'm discussing that here instead of GH because I'm not sure about your security goals for the CE. While I can read the code, I cannot infer intention without some kind of documentation (code comments, architecture documentation, security whitepaper, …).\n\nAs another potential bug regarding IIDs, consider that the IID–OID mapping has a 24:15 hour TTL, but that the IID will change at UTC midnight. This will break GA sessions around UTC midnight. Considering traffic patterns, it is more likely that visitors from the middle east will keep their IDs for a full day, whereas the change would occur during high-traffic periods in the US. Rotating the IID key at 3AM local time for the geolocation derived from the IP could be a great feature for your EE.\n\nI also think that your use of DynamoDB has a race condition, though again it will not affect the security of this scheme, at most lead to a small data quality loss. **I would not fix this.** Assume a new visitor that generates multiple events over a short timeframe. Assume *two* lambda instances consuming Kinesis events, so that both instances each get an event involving the user. Both instances will generate their own random OID and will keep using it for all events of that user within the batch. Both will write the OID to DynamoDB, and it's not clear to me which write would win. Thus, there will be at most 20 (batchsize) events in GA with the wrong Client ID. The split could persist even across sequential lambda invocations due to DynamoDB's eventual consistency. In practice, this shouldn't matter unless the database is distributed across multiple AWS regions.",

I will try to address each of your new remarks even though it is indubitably out of any interest for a non-technical audience who may read this :)  IMHO discussing in GitHub would benefit a broader audience. Anyway.\n\nConcerning your confusion about our claim that the IID is inaccessible after 24 hours.  \nYour whole reasoning starts with \"the functionName is known by the operator and is likely guessable\". It is not true. We use the function name as a viable random component in CE because when you deploy the provided infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, then AWS append a random suffix to the function name.  \nThis provides the first component of the hash key that is **random** but **stable across function invocations**.  \nTo reset the hash key after 24h, now we need another component that deterministically changes after 24h. Nothing better than the current timestamp truncated to the day.  \nNext, you talk about the quality of the resulting key. As I've already overly discussed this subject, in CE, this is the best we can achieve given the aforementioned constraints and the absence of other entropy sources. Note that this whole key generation part is replaced by a random key generated daily by the HSM in the hosted version. Moreover, any CE contribution is more than welcome if you want to provide one that complies with the constraints.\n\nOur security goals about CE are nothing out of the ordinary.  It must be as secure as possible, and as I said previously, anyone can contribute to fixes, improvements, documentation, etc. It is an open-source project.\n\nConcerning the singling-out remark. When using Google Analytics as is, you collect a lot of contextual information about the user (e.g., screen size, plugin versions, etc.). So your risk of singling out an individual is more than a theoretical risk, to not say elevated. Moreover, outside this contextual info, your users' cookie id is available in clear in Google Analytics for days. You can single out and target a particular individual if needed.  \nIn Privera, we adopted a way more frugal approach. Thus, you roughly end up with random ids and page views. We estimate the absolute and relative risk of singling-out an individual to be ridiculously low. If you want to dig into this specific subject, I recommend this paper on the [formalization of the GDPR’s notion of singling out](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/15/8344) (also referenced publicly on our website).  \n\n\nConcerning your remarks about sessions breakage. We are aware of this current limitation, and we did it on purpose. This initial version is an MVP and couldn't reasonably come out fully featured. We will provide ASAP an option to associate a timezone to the GA property ID (as currently possible in GA) both in the hosted and in the CE version. This way, the data controller will have the expected session stability. That said, thank you for pointing this out.\n\nConcerning the possible race condition on DynamoDB. Your reasoning starts with \"assume two lambda instances consuming Kinesis events\". It is not possible. Do you remember the MD5 hash of the partition key? In short, the way Kinesis works and the way we distribute data into it strongly guarantees that any event coming from a particular touchpoint will be stored on a well-known shard and will be processed sequentially by a single and well-known instance of a Lambda. By construction, we get the best balance between parallel processing of different touchpoints and sequential processing of the same touchpoint. Moreover, when processing the incoming stream of events from a particular touchpoint, we use the \"qt\" (queue time) parameter provided by GA measurement protocol to ensure that GA ingests events in order.  \nI won't go into the details of a multi-region deployment as it is obviously out of scope here. But keep in mind that it can be achieved with DynamoDB global tables and streams.  \n\n\nI think that I've addressed your new concerns and hope to see you star the GitHub repo as you seem to be more than intrigued by the project. :)",

I like bashing Fathom a lot because they have lots of boisterous marketing material, but Fathom's claims are much harder to verify, and some are probably wrong (e.g. their claim that user hashes – which correspond to your IIDs – were already anonymous).\n\nI might find the time later this year to implement a similar tool, though with different security and deployment assumptions (e.g. I really want to get rid of daily keys, and would like to use more probabilistic approaches in order to provide formal security guarantees.

For ePrivacy, it doesn't matter whether the information is personal data – this is about device-level privacy.\n\nYes trying to use analytics without consent is a hassle currently.

Since cookies or LocalStorage are stored on the user's device, setting cookies generally requires consent. Analytics are not strictly necessary for displaying a website.\n\nIt is only access to information on a device that matters here, not whether such information is combined with other identifiers. Thus, cookie consent is still necessary when truncating the IP address.\n\nTwo of the three sites you link (nomadlist, actualbudget) don't even seem to have a privacy policy – though there might be an argument that they are not subject to GDPR and ePrivacy. Analytics compliance *is* a concern for GDPR & ePrivacy compliance, but it has comparatively low priority (also low priority for supervisory authorities). Improper cookie consent is very very common, including here on Reddit.\n\nSo what should you do?\n\n* Collecting data is a liability. Limit data collection to what is actually necessary. Some kinds of analytics (e.g. counting pageviews) are possible without using cookies or IP addresses.\n* Concentrate on GDPR compliance for your core business activities. In particular:\n  * think through basic compliance questions for your processing activities: what is the purpose of processing, what is the Art 6 legal basis for processing, and what is the minimal amount of data necessary to achieve the purpose?\n  * write a privacy policy (see Art 13, Art 15 GDPR)\n  * make sure subcontractors are bound as data processors as appropriate (Art 28 GDPR), including sorting out international transfers\n  * take appropriate steps to ensure security of processing, including general infosec best practices and making backups\n* If you have time, consider sorting out non-essential activities. E.g. chat widgets on a website are currently very popular, but sorting out compliance can be more effort than they are worth.\n\nAnalytics are tricky because some analytics are often business-essential, whereas large amounts of data collected by common analytics solutions are entirely superfluous. But I think GA can be configured appropriately with reasonable effort. For example, these steps might contribute:\n\n* enable IP anonymization\n* deactivate cookie storage unless you want to implement a consent solution\n  * how to do that depends on how you load GA, here's the guide for analytics.js: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookies-user-id#disabling_cookies\n  * gtag.js has similar functionality under the `client_storage` config key, but this is undocumented\n* implement an opt-out solution, potentially accessible through your privacy policy (it's fine to use cookies to remember an opt-out: strictly necessary)\n* sign the DPA and SCCs in the GA settings\n* DO NOT enable data sharing with Google, such as for demographic data\n* if you have time, consider implementing opt-in to cookies, taking into account the conditions for consent in Art 7 GDPR\n  * if you're a web developer, doing this yourself is likely better than using a third party provider, unless you also want to show ads on your website\n* document the use of analytics in your privacy policy, perhaps using legitimate interest or consent as the legal basis (depending on whether you actually collect consent)\n\nYou do not have to show a cookie banner as mere notification, but you might use banners with a yes/no button in order collect consent. If you do, consider a “layered approach” that shows essential information right there in the banner so that visitors can make an informed choice, but also link to your full privacy policy.",

From what I understood, it's not enough to just show a banner notifying the users that the site is using cookies with a \"Got it\" or \"Ok\" button and a link to the Cookie Policy - you apparently need ways for the user to accept or reject the non-essential cookies, such as analytics for example.

If not - would a banner such as the one that Twitter uses be sufficient?\n\n\nThen there is the whole thing about a Data Processing Agreement - I haven't reached that stage yet, will leave this for later (maybe I'll hire someone since this is a bit over my head - there is a lot of lawyer speak in most of the documents I've seen).\n\n\nI'm not a lawyer, and your help is much appreciated (really!).

                "body": "Twitter's cookie banner says “By using Twitter’s services you agree to our Cookies Use”. This stopped being compliant in 2018 when the definition of consent was updated. Under the GDPR definition, consent must be an unambiguous, affirmative action. Continuing to use a site is not unambiguous. Also, pre-ticked checkboxes aren't OK (see the Planet 49 case mentioned elsewhere). Finally, consent must be specific to a purpose, so a user should be able to consent or decline consent for analytics separately from ad personalization or whatever.\n\nSo unfortunately, if you want consent you will need to show a banner or other user interface element, and will have to provide an actual choice. Since this messes with your bounce rate and data quality, I'd suggest considering cookie-less analytics.\n\nYou're correct that the vast majority of sites has dubious to flat out illegal cookie consent practices, but as I mentioned this is not a priority for anyone. But this complacency is dangerous as it opens up liability.\n\nData processing agreements are not optional, but a very crucial compliance step when outsourcing data processing activities. Sometimes they are part of normal service contracts, often they require ticking a checkbox in an admin panel. If they don't offer a DPA they're probably trash anyway. If your startup wants to sell B2B services, offering a DPA to customers is just as important as having a VAT ID.\n\nFor your privacy policy, you may want to go through Art 13 and Art 15 of the GDPR, as they almost contain a checklist of required items. E.g. you should enumerate the data subject rights (access, erasure, portability, …) even if they don't apply. The UK's ICO also offers very good guides, even though they're no longer part of the EU.\n\nI'm not a lawyer but more of a dev as well, so I understand how overwhelming compliance can be. The good news is that GDPR compliance requires a one-time effort to write a privacy policy etc, but then has acceptably low cost going forward (e.g. starting to use a new subcontractor? Ok, sign the usual DPA with them and potentially update your privacy policy, done). In the end, this is just a part of doing business, like sales or taxes.",

An example of storage would be placing a cookie on the user's device. An example of access would be reading a cookie on the user's device, or using JavaScript APIs to read out the browser window size for analytics purposes (accessing the window size purely for layout purposes would be strictly necessary though). My opinion here is based on the guidance on fingerprinting published around 2014 by the WP29, the EDPB's predecessor.\n\nSince analytics are not strictly necessary and were not explicitly requested by the user, **that means you need consent**.\n\nThe ePrivacy requirements are extremely strict and pretty problematic, but that's the law we have to deal with now. Concurrently with the GDPR, there was an effort to reform ePrivacy, which would also have allowed basic first-party analytics without consent. The updated law still hasn't been passed. In the meantime, we learned that Google lobbied hard against the update, for some reason. Post-Brexit the UK would have been able to issue a corresponding update on their own, but hasn't done so either (as far as I'm aware).\n\nI wouldn't pay too much attention to what the BBC is doing.

OK, there's a disclaimer that the recent case by the Austrian PA might change all of this, but even without that I'm confused about the following:\n\n1. No matter how you configure GA, it still sets cookies. I would think this is in violation of the ePrivacy directive.\n2. GA always generates a unique user ID, stored in a cookie. I'm under the impression that user-ID's, used to connect all data collected on your website over multiple visits to a unique user, are considered personal data under GDPR, and therefore need explicit consent.\n\nIs there anyone who knows why my above assumptions are not correct for the Netherlands? That would help me understand the complete absence of analytics consent requests by Dutch websites.\n\nPS: You can find the manual in Dutch [here](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/sites/default/files/atoms/files/handleiding_privacyvriendelijk_instellen_google_analytics_april_22.pdf).",

This is part of the EU ePrivacy directive. In this context, it does not matter whether the cookies (or similar technologies) contain personal data, as confirmed by the CJEU in the *Planet 49* case.\n* If Dutch data protection law has an analytics cookie exemption, then this potentially violates the EU directive.\n* In any case, the exception in Art 11.7a(3)(b) of the Dutch *Telecommunicatiewet* can only apply if the service in question is based in the Netherlands. It does not provide permissions for services from other EU member states.\n* The Dutch guidelines for Google Analytics pretty much suggest a reasonable baseline configuration for Google's Universal Analytics product. GA4 offers additional options for configuring GA in a more privacy-respecting manner.\n* In particular, GA4 makes it easier to collect analytics without storing anything on the user's device. This was also possible with UA, using an undocumented option `'client_storage': 'none'`.\n* We are in total agreement that GA's Client ID is personal data, so that it falls under the GDPR. This doesn't mean that processing it is forbidden. You do not “need explicit consent” – GDPR merely requires that you have a legal basis. That might be consent, and it's traditionally consent for analytics since you need consent anyway for the cookies. In a footnote, the Dutch guidance suggests a legitimate interest instead.\n* The disclaimer at the top of the Dutch guidance correctly points out concerns by the Austrian DPA and others about the lawfulness of using GA. This is unrelated to cookie consent issues, and is entirely about Schrems-II / data transfer issues.\n* If you're setting up a new analytics solution, it might be sensible to use an approach that won't be ruled invalid in a few months anyway. Consider using an analytics product that *guarantees* where your data will be processed, or host your own. For example, Matomo is Open Source software that you can host on your own servers, and it offers cookie-based analytics that are roughly comparable to GA/UA. I don't want to recommend paid/SaaS solutions, but there are a couple of providers with no ties to the US or other inadequate countries. The primary reason why GA is so popular is that it's decently good and free (since it acts as a loss leader to pull you into the Google Ads ecosystem).",

The ePrivacy directive allows for no legitimate interest with respect to cookies or similar client-side storage: either that storage is strictly necessary for the service, or you'll have to ask for consent.\n\nOther ePrivacy implementations such as the German TTDSG or the UK PECR follow the directive's rules correctly and don't provide the Dutch exception.\n\nThus, your counsel's guidance seems spot on with respect to cookie-based analytics – though analytics without any persistent info might be defensible under a legitimate interest.\n\nIt is well known that this aspect of ePrivacy is bad, especially since GDPR went into force. The ePrivacy directive was last updated in 2009, when there was a much more relaxed definition of consent with significant overlap with legitimate interests. GDPR defined consent much more precisely, requiring other DPAs to update their cookie consent guidelines.\n\nAn EU-wide ePrivacy update has long been planned, and the draft ePrivacy Regulation does allow for cookies being set on a legitimate interest. However, the regulation has been stalled and I won't believe any further news about alleged progress until it's actually voted on.",

Can I use cookie-based analytics under a LI?\n2. Can I use cookie-less but client-side analytics under a LI?\n3. Can I use server-side analytics under a LI?\n\nThe **first question** is simple: No. EPrivacy requires consent, unless you can rely on the special Dutch law. There is no room for a LI argument here.\n\nIt is likely that your legal counsel gave their advice in the context of this first scenario, and it seems absolutely correct.\n\nThe **second question** is more tricky. With cookie-less analytics, you're no longer *storing* information on the user's device. But the analytics JavaScript running in the browser might still be *accessing* information on the user's device for analytics purposes.\n\nMy personal opinion based on a strict reading of ePrivacy is that cookie-less analytics typically still require consent: they collect data on the user's device, this access is not strictly necessary, and thus ePrivacy requires consent – regardless of whether any personal data is involved. I think that this position is supported by the [WP29 opinion on fingerprinting from 2014 (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp224_en.pdf), especially section 7.1 (page 9):\n\n> A number of online services have proposed device fingerprinting as an alternative to HTTP cookies for the purpose of providing analytics without the need for consent under [ePrivacy] Article 5(3). […] However, [previous opinions] also stated that currently there is no exemption to consent for cookies that are strictly limited to first party anonymised and aggregated statistical purposes. Therefore, first-party website analytics through device fingerprinting do not fall under the exemption […] and consent of the user is required.\n\nIn practice, no one cares and such information is routinely collected without consent.\n\nFinally, the **third scenario** is interesting. With server-side analytics, no extra data is collected on the user's device. The only data used is that to which the server has access anyway. This server-side information could be a HTTP log file, but also much more interesting information such as business-level events (e.g. user 123 purchased article XYZ, user Alice visited user Bob's profile, …).\n\nBecause no client-side information access occurs, we can ignore the ePrivacy consent requirement.\n\nInstead, we only have to think about a suitable GDPR legal basis for processing this personal data. The proper legal basis will depend a lot on the purpose for which we are using this info, and with “purpose” I mean something more specific than “improving our services”.\n\nI think there would be a fairly strong LI argument if the purpose is to collect aggregated measurements of system usage. I would be more sceptical if the purpose is profiling users, e.g. creating personalized interest profiles for marketing purposes.",

E.g a written statement of an insurance claim if attributable to a person is Personal Data but would not fall under a PII definition. This is critical.\n\nSecondly, consent is only one legal basis for processing personal data. In your article you say that to process personal data requires consent under article 6. In fact any and all of the legal bases in article six are equally valid.\n\nIf you are talking about data protection by design, these are two absolutely critical elements that you need to understand and explain the nuance off as without that, any model you introduce to automate the process (which I don't think is possible) will be extremely limited and not usable by any data protection professional as it only covers a fraction of the legal standard.",

I would argue that any work pertaining to the same domain will inevitably bear some resemblance. This is to be expected, as science has progressed by building on prior knowledge. \n\nSeveral points regarding why it is useful or interesting compared to other similar works are as follows:\n\n1. Certainly, this work is based on particular use-cases, namely smart cities and insurance. The use cases themselves are diverse and pose a different set of challenges on their own. With our work, we showed how we addressed those challenges, and this is generalisable. You should also note that these challenges are the real industrial challenges in practice, which most of the works do not address (or only partially compared to ours).  \n2. System design and implementation is a large topic in and of itself, posing a unique set of challenges that many industries and academics are still grappling with today. I am not going to get into it right now, but I would say that system design and implementation are just as critical as any other task. For example, what is the value of your modelling if it cannot be implemented in practice? Having said that, I do not minimise the importance of modelling.  Regarding what's new, I would say the approach and the implementation itself. For example, the use of Next Generation Access Control (NGAC [https://standards.incits.org/apps/group\\_public/project/details.php?project\\_id=2328](https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=2328)  )-based policy mechanisms (i.e., customised and enhanced) and other methodologies for secure implementations, such as deterministic layered-encryption techniques other than compliance checking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's getting a little long, so I'll just sum it up here. Our work provides a new approach and implementation to deal with the GDPR challenges in practice, taking best practices and tools from experts ranging from security, and semantics to law. In other words, it provides the best of both worlds: privacy and law.",

(Note that consent is not *necessarily* an obligation. GDPR on its own, without ePD, might allow website analytics to use Legitimate Interest as its Legal Basis, assuming you're not enabling the features that connect it to other data sources or using it for advertising.) This implementation has a higher chance than other approaches I've seen, but still not guaranteed.\n\nWhat data is sent to the first-party back-end? That's still processing that's happening, if data it collects is still identifiable when received by your servers, then GDPR applies to that processing regardless of what gets passed on to Google. \n\nAre you sending the page URL that the user visited?

Here's some examples in JSON that should be easy to work with: [https://github.com/ray-lothian/UserAgent-Switcher/tree/9932ea2761b77171e11edf47d1ea49a1d93d3705/extension/firefox/data/popup/browsers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-lothian/UserAgent-Switcher/9932ea2761b77171e11edf47d1ea49a1d93d3705/extension/firefox/data/popup/browsers/firefox-gentoo.json)\n\nThat being said, your geo-ip solution is definitely not anonymous. In dense areas, IP blocks down to /24 are often attributed to specific geographical areas, and will further allow you to identify the ISP and other data points that could lead to re-identification. If you really want the region, you should get a list of non-personal IPs per region, do the geo-ip lookup with reverse geocoding, and then replace the IP with a region one that has nothing to do with the user.\n\nConcerning the ePrivacy Directive and GDPR, you will still need opt-in consent for this activity, regardless of whether you anonymize the data or not. In your privacy policy you can be clear that the data used for statistical purposes is anonymized, which may mean that more people opt in to it, but you're still effectively processing the data for a secondary purpose of processing, so whatever consent you obtained for engaging with the site itself is insufficient for covering this. Some people try to shove this under legitimate interests as an alternative legal basis of processing, but it's up to you in this case whether you want to take the risk of invoking the ire of your DPA.",

You're probably storing them in a way that relates to particular accounts, or the original account could be found via a reverse image search.\n\n* Since it's personal data, you will need a legal basis per Art 6(1) GDPR.\n\n* Consent (Art 6(1)(a) GDPR) always works. But since you're not in contact with the data subjects, you can't ask for consent first.\n\n* Personal data can also be processed under a legitimate interest (Art 6(1)(f) GDPR), so on an opt-out basis. But this only works if your legitimate interest outweighs the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject. This requires conducting a balancing test. Recital 47 GDPR provides more guidance on conducting such a balancing test:\n\n  > Such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. \n\n  But here, there is no relevant relationship between the data subjects (accounts) and your platform. The data subjects cannot “reasonably expect” that you'll scrape this data. At most, such an argument could be done for very high profile accounts that are effectively public figures. So I think that a legitimate interest balancing test would generally fail.\n\nA non-GDPR aspect that should also be considered is the copyright in the profile pictures. Since you don't have a contract with the data subjects, you have not received a license to use those images. And European copyright laws generally don't have a broad “fair use” exception that could apply here. At most, the social media platforms you're scraping might provide you with a necessary license, but I'd doubt it.",

In a clinical setting, there might be issues if treatment would be withheld unless consent to participate in a study is given.\n\nBut the “no detriment” rule does not mean that consenting vs non-consenting data subjects must be treated exactly equally. In its [guidelines to consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en), the EDPB mentions in passing the concept of a “permissible incentive” for consent.

Such a voucher could even *help* ensuring a truly free choice, in the sense that the voucher also serves as compensation for the time spent on participating in the survey, balancing out the drawback for participating in the study.

Thus, many countries are going to have consumer protection laws that state you can't sneak anything surprising in there.\n\nThe GDPR concept of “consent” tries to avoid these problems. Consent is defined to be a “freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her” (Art 4(11) GDPR). And per Art 7(2), requests for consent must be clearly distinguishable from other matters – they cannot be hidden in a larger document.\n\nHere, the relevant aspect is that consent must be specific, informed, and unambiguous. If the data subject doesn't know what they consented to, then the consent wasn't sufficiently informed and is therefore *invalid*. If consent is sought for multiple distinct purposes, a “consent to all” button might also be too unspecific and too ambiguous for obtaining valid consent. The very first layer of a consent flow should directly summarize the purposes for which consent is sought.\n\nSo far, the theory.\n\nIn practice, consent management tools are not just used for cookie consent, but for a variety of processing purposes ranging from fairly harmless analytics cookies, to more invasive ad personalization, cross-site tracking, embedding third party content, and sometimes even international data transfers. These tools are so complex that there's almost certainly something hidden in there that user's wouldn't expect when clicking on “accept all”. So it's quite likely that a lot of sneaky things are being done here.\n\nFor further details on how GDPR consent is supposed to work, consider reading the [EDPB guidelines on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en). Section 3.3 of that document discusses when consent is sufficiently informed. If you're in the UK, the [ICO website includes guidelines on consent](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/what-is-valid-consent/).\n\nWhile cookies and similar technologies always require consent because the ePrivacy Directive (UK: PECR) says so, other processing activities might not need consent. For example, data processing is also legal if it is necessary for fulfilling a contract with the data subject. Notably, Facebook attempted the argument that per its terms of service (that Facebook had written itself), Facebook was contractually bound to deliver personalized ads to users. How convenient, since this avoided the need to ask users for consent. But this is not a good argument. As mentioned, terms of service cannot contain surprising terms. Immediately when the GDPR came into force, NOYB initiated complaints against this. Back in 2019, and presumably in reaction to the NOYB cases, the [EDPB published guidelines on the use of contractual necessity as a legal basis](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-22019-processing-personal-data-under-article-61b_en), pointing out that something doesn't just become necessary for providing a service just because a contract says so. But, according to a [NOYB update from 2021](https://noyb.eu/en/irish-dpc-greenlights-facebooks-gdpr-bypass), the Irish DPC doesn't feel like following the EDPB's guidelines :)",

To comply with the GDPR you need to have some internal documents and procedures however, for which companies tend to hire legal advisors. I guess this type of service starts at ~500€, but can easily exceed it. \n\nBut it's quite easy to do yourself. Read a few GDPR compliance guides and checklists and you should have a reasonable understanding of what's expected. You basically need to:\n- describe your goals and justify what personal data you're processing and why\n- do a privacy impact assessment\n- appoint a GDPR compliance officer\n- create internal data protection policies and ensure everybody with access understands internal and legal requirements \n- create procedures for requesting and exporting, updating and removal of your customers data and describe them in your privacy policy (these functions can be automated but you can also point them to an email address)\n- create procedures to notify authorities and subjects in case of a data breach\n- sign data processing agreements with 3rd parties if they process personal information or if you're processing their data\n\nIt might seem excessive but once you're used to the jargon it's fairly easy, and you can reuse 95% of it. Also don't forget to charge your customers for this, most SMBs only need to add a little info about their other/analog operations to all this to be compliant.\n\nAnd my final advice is to not go to deep or worry to much about it. Since you're a small player they won't audit you (I believe they only audit organizations with 50 or so employees or millions of revenue), and if they do they'll check if you're aware and have your documentation ready but probably won't scrutinize the actual implementation.

Advertising companies assign unique identifiers to publisher's website users via these cookies so they can create a user profile and display more relevant ads.\n\nNow, let's say that a website has no cookie banners (doesn't ask for consent) and still allows ad-related third party cookies to be installed in the end user's browser. The cookie is called 'ID', comes from an advertising company domain and contains a string of random lettes. Obviously this breaks the ePrivacy rule about consent to cookies that are not strictly necessary and it's easy to spot. But how can I tell if this string of random letters is my own identifier? It could very well mean nothing and just be random letters, how to prove that it actually goes against the GDPR?\n\nOne more thing.

If you don't already know, then it's a GDPR violation for insufficient transparency, regardless of what they're actually using it for.\n\nTo find out more, send a Data Subject Access Request (per Article 15) asking what data is associated with that identifier.

But the data subject can use a browser debugger (or network inspector or whatever) to find their GUID, and send an email saying \"here's my pseudonymous ID, what do you have on me?\" Even without that comment, GDPR *probably* says the Controller has to service that request (keeping in mind other issues like verifying identity, etc). But that line makes it a bit more clear and explicit that the Controller must consider the data subject to have been identified.",

Once they realise they may not get as much data as they wish, some insist I implement it, or install plugins to do this themselves. I am astonished at how many have no knowledge of data privacy nor care anything about it.\n\nMy understanding is that I am a processor and they are the controller, and as such the liability for non-compliance lies with them.\n\nI am considering formalising a process by using a form they must complete so that they have to explicitly acknowledge this. I will include links to the relevant sections on the ICO site. There are two reasons for doing this:\n\n1. so that they consider their choices and\n2. so that I have a record of their decisions, in case they go ahead and install plugins without my knowledge (and subsequently accuse me of implementing non-compliant code).\n\nMy DPA has the following clauses, which I think are relevant:\n\n>Each party shall comply with the Data Protection Laws with respect to the processing of the Controller Personal Data.  \n>  \n>The Controller warrants to the Processor that it has the legal right to disclose all Personal Data that it does in fact disclose to the Processor under or in connection with this Agreement.  \n>  \n>The Processor shall only process the Controller Personal Data on the documented instructions of the Controller (including with regard to transfers of the Controller Personal Data to any place outside the European Economic Area), as set out in this Agreement or any other document agreed by the parties in writing.  \n>  \n>The Processor shall promptly inform the Controller if, in the opinion of the Processor, an instruction of the Controller relating to the processing of the Controller Personal Data infringes the Data Protection Laws.\n\nI'd appreciate any insights as I'd really like to ensure I am doing the right things, and not exposing myself to legal risk.",

You could also consider adding a specific provision in your agreement relating to obtaining cookie consent, and also a liability provision shifting responsibility onto them if you somehow get into trouble because they failed to comply with law",

So with that in mind the answer to your question is a no.The question does spark further interesting questions.

I did have a quick search through Googles docs but found nothing specific - in Google's case I believe that to be by design.  Public interest has been mentioned as a candidate but I doubt it as well - they could maybe get away with it in some EU members states, but all of them?...\n\nReading some of the replies here however makes me think that some respondents need to go re-read the GDPR and start from scratch with the definition for 'personal data'\n\nAn address where someone lives, officially registered or not, is personal data.Personal data remains personal data whether it is data that directly identifies or can be used in combination with other data to identify a natural person.\n\nIn my opinion the satelite image / aerial photo itself is capturing 'location data' which is personal data so Google needs to have a legal basis,  provide proper information & provide a way to opt out & object as per the lawfulness, fairness & transparency obligation.  But the current situation is not that.  The legal basis is not clear, information is not given in a clear and transparent way (not to mention before/at the moment/as soon as possible after collection), you can have streetview images blurred by Google but I am not certain if that is the case for top down satelite / aerial photographs.",

Another entry is added with new data (pr, method, wd) If the procedure of cancellation is stopped by the user.\n\nnow my question is: when I run the procedure to delete his account I need to leave the entry in the table or can I delete it directly? \n\n(the website is going to be accessible only by our country and it's not the UK, and the cancellation of every data is the default procedure when you ask to terminate your account).\n\nThank you for your reading this.",

Usually, Art 6(1)(b) (necessity for performance of a contract) will be a more suitable legal basis for most services.\n2. The Art 17 right to erasure is not absolute. It has many conditions and exceptions. If you have a good reason to keep the data beyond account deletion, you can probably do that.\n3. When managing consent, a main consideration will be Art 7(2): “the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data”. This often requires keeping such records, and may require keeping such records for some specified period after consent was withdrawn, in case there's any legal dispute about this. But the GDPR doesn't provide any fixed retention periods, and the controller can choose whatever period they consider appropriate.\n4. The GDPR never expects agreement to a privacy policy. The GDPR does expect certain information to be provided, but that's just a notice to the data subjects. It doesn't need to be acknowledged by the user. Asking for explicit acceptance of a privacy notice could create the wrong impression that you're indeed relying on consent as a legal basis, which would greatly restrict how you can process the data.",

If the only way to get the discounts was to give consent, that could be a problem.\n\nBut this doesn't prevent all incentives to give consent. For example, consent to personalized ads might make it possible to provide personalized discounts, with non-personalized discounts being available without that consent. Note that with such scenarios, the burden of proof is on the data controller to show that consent was obtained in a compliant manner.\n\nFor a more authoritative discussion of these matters, read the [EDPB guidelines on consent (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en), in particular section 3.1.4 Detriment. The personalized discount example is presented in example 9 / paragraph 50.\n\nIf you're in the UK, also consider the [ICO's guidance on the “freely given” criterion of consent](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/what-is-valid-consent/#what2). On the matter of incentives, the ICO writes:\n\n> The ICO’s view is that it may still be possible to incentivise consent to some extent. There will usually be some benefit to consenting to processing. For example, if joining the retailer’s loyalty scheme comes with access to money-off vouchers, there is clearly some incentive to consent to marketing. The fact that this benefit is unavailable to those who don’t sign up does not amount to a detriment for refusal. However, you must be careful not to cross the line and unfairly penalise those who refuse consent.",

Consent also has to be informed and specific – you have to give enough information about the cookies used that they can make an informed decision, and they should be able to consent to one purpose but not another (e.g. analytics yes but marketing no).\n\nTo some degree, this is the fault of the EU. The requirement to ask for consent for all cookies is excessive. The ePrivacy Directive which introduced the cookie consent requirement was supposed to be updated together with the GDPR, but since about three years there hasn't been any progress.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you will have to use a cookie consent banner. But since a compliant banner will make it easy to decline consent, you will get somewhat useless data.

Clearly, ticking a checkbox is one possible way how a data subject can unambiguously indicate their wishes. This section says that browsers or other software can manage consent as well.\n\nBut this does not affect the conditions for consent, especially Art 7 GDPR. In particular: consent must be specific and informed. It is not possible to consent to “cookies”. Consent should relate to a particular *purpose* instead.   With common browsers, the only choice users have is “allow all cookies” vs “block third party cookies”. But there are no options to make choices like “allow cookies if they are strictly necessary, or if they are used solely for analytics purposes, or if they are set by twitter.com, but block any other cookies”.\n\nIn some cases, browsers do offer suitable consent management. E.g. if a website wants to access your camera, microphone, or location information, you'll get a consent popup from your browser. Similar features are integrated into mobile operating systems. Per the quoted PECR part, that is a potentially valid mechanism to manage consent.\n\nNevertheless, consent must be informed. These browser-supported consent mechanisms do not typically provide enough context to make an informed decision, so I don't think they are generally sufficient for valid consent by themselves.\n\nThe Web does not currently have suitable technologies through which websites can indicate for which purposes they use a cookie or other features, and have no way to provide information necessary for an informed decision. Well, other than the classic way of showing a cookie banner.\n\n> To my (uneducated) eyes, this reads that if a browser settings are configured to *accept* cookies (as is the default) that this is good enough for consent under PECR.\n\nNope, that does not look like it would fulfil the conditions for valid consent. A default setting can never constitute consent because there was no “clear affirmative action” by the data subject.",

                "body": "P.S.: Incidentally, this is why the Do Not Track standard sank. Browsers can indicate to websites whether the users wishes to be tracked. This setting has three states (yes/no/indeterminate). Next to no websites use this information because it isn't clear what “do not track” is supposed to mean, and since there is no legal obligation to honour it. But if this setting was present, it at least was an unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes. Then Internet Explorer 10 decided to activate DNT *by default*. This caused the tracking industry to essentially say: oh no, we don't know if the user *really* wanted to ~opt-out from tracking~ *get less relevant ads*, so we'll better ignore this setting. Thus, DNT became even less relevant.\n\nThe Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a more recent iteration on this idea with only two states (privacy signal/indeterminate). Unlike DNT, it received some legal backing: it is a valid *and binding* “do not sell my personal information” signal under the CCPA. But I have severe doubts whether this can have any effect in a GDPR context. The GPC draft spec (2021-12-16) says:\n\n> The GDPR requires that \"Natural persons should have control of their own personal data\" ([GDPR], Recital 7). The GPC signal is intended to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user's personal data to other data controllers ([GDPR] Articles 7 & 21). This request is expressed with every interaction that the user agent has with the server.\n>\n> Note that this request is not meant to withdraw a user's consent to local storage as per the ePrivacy Directive (\"cookie consent\") ([EPRIVACY-DIRECTIVE]) nor is it intended to object to direct marketing under legitimate interest ([GDPR]).\n\nSo essentially: it would be nice if this causes websites to do some privacy-positive things, but it's totally unclear what it's supposed to mean (except that it doesn't affect consent status).",

                "body": "You are in essence asking if illegally collected data can be used legally. I think this is a tricky question that also depends on what other lawful use is being proposed. In some cases, it may be possible to argue that the two processing activities are separate so that failing to obtain a valid legal basis for one activity doesn't affect the other. But in general, it will be difficult to argue that illegally acquired data can be used legally. Consent does not allow use for a different purpose, and failing to obtain required consent must not result in more rights to the controller. I also think that a legitimate interest balancing test would generally fail in such a context.\n\n## Breaking the law can't be better than adhering to it.\n\nFirst, lets consider what happens if valid consent had been obtained, as is legally required in the case of analytics cookies. Per the purpose limitation principle in GDPR Art 5(1)(b),\n\n> Personal data shall be […] collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes\n\nIf personal data is collected for purpose A we can only use it for purpose A, or a purpose B if B is compatible with A. Art 6(4) provides criteria to determine whether two purposes are compatible. But these criteria do not apply when the legal basis was consent. **Consent is always specific to a purpose**, so there cannot be a compatible purpose outside of consent (though I would argue that vital interests and legal obligations could override the consent purpose limitation).\n\nBreaking the law must not produce more beneficial outcomes than adhering to it. If consent is legally required, then failing to obtain consent cannot allow more uses of the data than if everything had been done by the book.\n\n## Separate legal bases for separate purposes.\n\nBut here the crux is that we must consider for what consent has been obtained. The ePrivacy directive (and national implementations like the PECR) require consent for accessing or storing information on the end user's device, where such access or storage is not strictly necessary to perform a service explicitly requested by the end user. In the context of analytics, we need consent to store a pseudonymous client ID on the end users device, for example by placing a cookie. We arguably also need consent to access JavaScript APIs for collecting analytics metrics, such as screen size or collecting data for fingerprinting.\n\nWhereas we need consent for placing cookies and collecting analytics data, we don't necessarily need that consent for subsequent processing of the data. It may be possible to argue that these are distinct processing activities that can be covered by separate legal bases. Then, a failure to obtain a valid legal basis for activity A might not affect the legality of activity B.\n\n## Deletion obligations when data has been processed unlawfully.\n\nAnother wrinkle in this matter is that unlawfully processed data should be deleted. To my surprise the GDPR doesn't say that if data has been collected illegally, then it must be deleted. Instead, data subjects can request erasure if their data has been processed unlawfully (Art 17(1)(d)), and supervisory authorities can order deletion (Art 58(2)).\n\n## Legitimate interest balancing test.\n\nWhen claiming a legitimate interest, it is necessary to perform a suitable balancing test that weighs the claimed legitimate interest against the rights and freedoms of the affected persons. Per Recital 47, criteria for this balancing test include “the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller”. If the data controller is performing a processing activity for which a data subject would reasonably expect a consent request first, it will be difficult to show that a legitimate interest exists.\n\n## Counterexamples\n\nThe GDPR has broad exemptions from the purpose limitation principle for “archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes”, subjects to safeguards per Art 89. Analytics tend to involve statistics so maybe there's an argument here, but at least Google Analytics allows way too fine-grained profiling for its reports to benefit from this exemption.\n\nI can also imagine scenarios (outside of the analytics context) where there is a strong legitimate interest to process unlawfully obtained data. For example, I'd argue that the HIBP data breach notification service is not prohibited by the GDPR from processing leaked and breached data. This is similar in that most data used by HIPB has become available by illegal means, but dissimilar in that the illegal and legal processing activities have been undertaken by different controllers.",

In the US, the FCC set up an 'abuse@fcc.gov' email address specifically for citizens to use when signing up for things where they did not consent to marketing communications, for example. If your employees are filling things out simply to satisfy form validation requirements and do not require ready access to the mail inbox, a similar approach could also be used here. Granted, since the GDPR has come along, most forms require a double opt-in, so this may have more limited utility these days.",

When I signed the contract, I opted not to tick the box for marketing emails/texts/etc. When GDPR hit, they never contacted me to get consent to marketing emails. As far as I recall, I've never been sent marketing emails from them directly.\n\nA few days ago, I got a text from the dealership asking me to trade in my car for a new car; they'd give me a great deal, etc etc. It was a number that didn't support replies and I couldn't opt-out of receiving more messages, so I ignored it. \n\nToday, I got an email (from the same salesman I bought my car off of in 2017) saying:\n\n>\"Hi (my name), Thank you for your interest in (car brand). I am delighted to attach a copy of your recent quotation along with my contact details. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\"\n\nAttached was an actual quotation that had all of my details and all the details of a brand new car with a repayments schedule, as if I had requested this in-store or over the phone. \n\nBecause it was from the same car salesman it didn't seem like spam, so I was worried that somehow my details were leaked and this was a fake quote or someone trying to impersonate me or something. I replied to say I've no interest in a new car and didn't ask for a quote. The salesman replied saying: \n\n>\"We’ve sent out a text earlier just to see would you have any interest in trading in your car, so just wanted to follow up with a few figures to see if you wanted to change.\"\n\nBased on his response, it seems like this is some kind of marketing tactic to get me to trade up? Now, I'm going to reply asking to be removed from whatever mailing list I'm on and hopefully that's the end of it. I'm just curious about the following:\n\n* Is this sort of thing allowed under GDPR? I never consented to getting marketing emails or texts from the dealership, can they add me to their mailing list without consent if I was an existing customer? Even if I didn't opt in at the time I signed the contract? \n* Raising a fake quotation and sending it to a customer as if they requested it seems very shady to me, but does it actually violate GDPR? Has anyone ever encountered something like this before?",

Instead, we must look at the ePrivacy Directive (ePD), which particularizes and complements the GDPR. As an EU directive, every EU member state has its own implementation, but the directive sets a common baseline.\n\nThe `gdpr.eu` page correctly says that you don't need consent for strictly necessary cookies. This mirrors Art 5 ePD, that says that you don't need consent for accessing or storing information on the user's device if this is strictly necessary for providing a service explicitly requested by the user. \n\nWhen the user explicitly selects a particular UI theme, then it seems strictly necessary to store that selection so that it persists across page loads. Then, no consent or cookie banner would be necessary. Without consent, there's nothing to document. It would still be sensible to disclose the use of these cookies e.g. as part of a privacy notice.",

That type of consent won’t be valid as it isn’t freely given.  Arguably by doing so the controller is basing all of their processing on consent, and so all of the processing would lack a legal basis \n\nConsent cannot legitimise processing that would otherwise be unlawful, ie it’s not ok to process personal data in violation of the GDPR because the data subject has given consent, the processing would still be unlawful even though the data subject agreed to it.  Consent is just one of a number of legal bases in that is available, and the processing must still be fair and lawful (and comply with the other DP principles) when consent is the legal basis.\n\nRegarding sharing personal data, that is a form of processing like any other, so a legal basis is required to do it.  The question is, is there a legitimate interest in the sharing that outweighs any negative impact of the processing in data subjects?  Data subject expectations, how the data will be used, and the purpose of the sharing will be key here.  If not, then the only real option to share the data would be to obtain consent",

It is my understanding that this provision became obsolete when the GDPR entered into force and ended the practice of “implied consent”.

I'm skeptical about their GDPR claims. Additionally, their statements about the functionality of GA have some factual errors.\n\n[ICO's cookie guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies/#cookies5) would imply that IP address (\"data exposed by the use of particular network protocols\") is covered by PECR and falls under the same regulation. You don't need consent to use IP address to serve a webpage because using the IP is \"strictly necessary\" for that service. However [analytics is explicitly called out](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-the-rules-on-cookies-and-similar-technologies/#rules10) as not meeting \"strictly necessary.\" Combined, these would indicate that Matomo is not exempt in ICO's opinion.\n\nOther regulators have more-or-less said that GA is OK. The Dutch regulator even has a guide on how to make GA compliant, which doesn't require too much beyond the out-of-the-box configuration (it's more focused on things *not* to do).\n\nRegarding specific claims:\n\n> the data is not used for any other purpose than analytics (compared to GA which uses it for other purposes and therefore always requires consent)\n\nFirst, analytics purposes requires consent according to some regulators. Second, GA can be used for analytics alone. I don't believe that the consent will depend on whether it *could* be used for other purposes, but whether it *actually is* used for other purposes. \n\n> visitors aren’t tracked across websites (compared to GA which does track visitors across many websites)\n\nBy default GA does not track across websites. There are configuration options that enable this, but again there's a difference between the *capability* and the *actual usage*.\n\nI'm also having trouble seeing why they believe you need to mention Matomo in your privacy policy, but claim that the data it processes doesn't count as personal data. That seems contradictory. If it's not personal data, then GDPR doesn't have any requirements to put it in your privacy policy; if it's in your privacy policy, it's because you believe it's personal data.\n\nUltimately if you have concerns I would run them by your *own* counsel rather than relying on Matomo's marketing material.",

The issue I have with Matomo's suggestion is that a daily changing fingerprint is still an identifier for that day, so that the GDPR's concept of anonymization is probably not fulfilled.\n\nWhether accessing device details with JavaScript to create a high-fidelity fingerprint is cookie-like is subject to debate, but the consensus seems to be that such fingerprints are equivalent to cookies when considering ePrivacy. I hope that a court would take a more nuanced approach, e.g. by making a distinction between technical data such as the screen resolution and invasive fingerprinting such as canvas fingerprinting, or extracting the list of installed fonts.\n\nI don't think that the use of JavaScript is a problem in itself.

This setup is slightly more privacy-preserving than Matomo's fingerprint based solution, which allows sessions to be tracked during one day.\n\nI believe that disabling Client ID storage and enabling the anonymize-IP option is sufficient to run analytics without asking for consent: there is no access to information on terminal equipment so ePrivacy Art 5(3) doesn't apply, and traffic data such as IP addresses is anonymized in order to satisfy ePrivacy Art 6(1). As far as GDPR is concerned, I rely on *legitimate interest* as a legal basis. I support opt out via the Do Not Track header.

        "selftext": "Hi, hoping you guys can help. My issue seems a little nuanced so a second opinion would be great - though it might require some familiarity with  web dev. soooo....\n\nI am building a web-app. Users keep their anonymity - though are assigned an ID on registration (simply a 'BEGIN' button). They are asked a series of questions as they progress through the app, similar to a survey, with feedback given after each set of questions. \n\nThe questions relate to user experiences, though no combination of data points can be used to re-identify them. Answers are stored and attributed to a user ID. This allows us to recall answers later and give feedback. It will also allow us to give the user a password so they can recall their session at a later date. \n\nWe maintain that this data does not pertain to a users actual identity and we *only retain data that is necessary for our app to work*. Some of the collected answers are used for research, which is stated clearly in our Privacy Notice. The 'research' part is simply some automated graphs etc showing aggregate trends across answers. \n\nReferencing cookie law, our cookie banner offers users a choice to \n\n\t*i) Persist their login details locally so they can quickly resume there session easily on this device*\n\n\t*ii) opt in to Google Analytics*\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. The data we need for the app to work (arguably 'strictly necessary') is also used for internal research/reporting - two purposes, though we are fully transparent with our intentions. We highlight this both on the registration page and in our Privacy Notice. Both purposes are essential for the app to run, and \"opt-out\" is not really possible in this case. Does GDPR prevent us from generating reports from the data we collect? What is the correct way for us to ask them to agree to this on registration?\n2. By default no data is stored on the users computer, though a user ID is generated on registration and subsequent answers are sent to our server. I would like to persist the ID in localstorage so that the users session can be recalled when they return. Do I need the user to opt in to do this (i.e an option to consent within our cookie banner - above)? Can an \"accept all\" option be used? it is unlikely they will opt in at all if they have to configure each cookie individually with our cookie manager. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. This is a tricky area indeed x",

This Jackal08 fellow seems to be taking your concerns seriously, which is good, and he's correct that the data in isolation can't identify an individual, but that's not necessarily how GDPR works.\n\nFirst and foremost, they need to look at the ePrivacy Directive. People call it the \"cookie law\" but the text covers reading any data from a device. A MAC address is not a cookie, but it's covered by ePD. \n\nFurthermore, the fact that data is identifying when combined with other data, would raise a flag to me that the data is actually personal data. Like, I can get my own MAC address and then email them and ask \"what data do you have about me?\" and it's technically feasible to answer that. In my opinion (and this is only an opinion), that's a significant step towards the data being personal data.\n\nThe linked GDPR notice is not a privacy policy. The linked privacy policy is not GDPR-compliant. A light skim indicates several critical components which are missing, most notably the legal bases of processing activities. Also \"industry standard for SaaS products\" is not necessarily compliant.",

The ICO website is the only website I know that does this well, since consent controls are always available in the lower left corner. Phones also make it easy to revoke device permissions from apps. If the data controller doesn't offer a way to revoke consent with a couple of clicks, this would clearly heighten the need to occasionally check in with the data subject to ensure that consent is still valid.\n\nIf anything changes about the basis on which consent was given – e.g. if data collected under consent shall be used for additional purposes – then new consent would be mandatory.",

We have never directly held the record of consent, instead making a series of monthly spot checks with the client where we take a sample from the data supplied and ask them to check and confirm they have a record of consent.\n\nIn light of the SAR I asked them to supply me with the actual record of consent instead of just confirming that they had it and the response I got, from our client, was :\n\n\"We have the following wording on our petitions that maybe they missed :\n\n'If you choose to leave your contat details we will use them to contact you for further campains and/or donations.

In most cases upon initial download of an app, the merchant (bike retailer in this case) would ask for consent to send push notifications to the users device. This would prompt the ‘allow’ ‘don’t allow’ screen we are all familiar with. \n\nMy question is, at what point- if ever in this process is marketing consent gained. If it is not, when can it? Let’s say I want to make my app customers aware of an upcoming sale, I want to send a push notification to do this. \n\nI’ve seen that some apps prompt the user to accept a cookie policy/privacy policy. Would this suffice?\n\nGrateful for any responses, citing legislation would be extremely helpful as I am in the hypothetical process of app development. Many thanks.",

                "body": "The first question to answer is whether you need marketing consent for push notifications at all.  The ePrivacy Directive is the relevant EU law that imposes the consent requirement, but that law has no direct effect itself, and is instead implemented by member state law at the national level.  Consequently, while there is a degree of consistency across the EU, the law differs in each country.  Also keep in mind that in most cases the law probably won’t specifically address push notifications, and the question will largely depend on whether member state regulators (through guidance they publish) interpret the law as covering them.  In the U.K., for example, the regulator considers communications to fall within scope if they are stored and retrievable by the user at a later date…so an email would fall within scope but regular internet ads would not.\n\nIf you do get consent, it needs to be freely given, specific and given by a clear affirmative action, among other things.  I recommend reading the ico direct marketing [code of practice](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2021/2619043/direct-marketing-code-draft-guidance-122020.pdf) for a summary of what those requirements entail and what you need to do to obtain valid consent.  Accepting a privacy notice wouldn’t be sufficient, as that agreement isn’t specific to receiving direct marketing, and also likely isn’t considered freely given.",

If they wish to continue, then you can pop up the OS dialog requesting permission (but be aware, they can still say no by declining the OS notification).   You can demonstrate that you have  \n\\* Given context to the user about how the information will be used  \n\\* What benefits they will be getting in return  \n\\* other uses that you may have for the information\n\nIf the OS indicator says they agreed, then you can push information to them (they can still bail out at this point).  \n\n\nYou will also need to provide a way for the user to turn off receiving these notifications.  If you're allowing them to turn it on within the app, you need to have them turn it off in the app (and it must be as easy to locate the option as it was turning the feature on).  \n\n\nAs others have stated, the ePrivacy directive handles this but it's a bit of a mess depending on the geography and whether you can or cannot send marketing messages unsolicited.  If you do it in the above manner, I believe you would have a defensible position regardless of the country has you can demonstrate that your app has provided enough information for the consent to be valid.

My question isn’t so much about the data collected, but more about the legal basis for the purpose of making an assessment of the support they require. The only viable option it seems for the special category data is explicit consent. None of the other 9 article 9 conditions would work. But in terms of the basic article 6 condition I am torn between ‘legitimate interests’ or ‘consent’. Providing support of this kind is the very essence of why the charity exists which suggests legitimate interest. Question 1 - Consent wouldn’t necessarily be needed to make an assessment of their data would it? (Apart from explicit consent for the special category data)\n\nI see any processing after the assessment purpose as different purposes as they are too wide ranging to come under a ‘single purpose of support’ e.g counselling support, financial support, payment toward a holiday, help with housing, etc. Question 2 - Do you think this is the right way of looking at it? I.e looking at the subsequent support after the assessment as different discrete purposes which need their own legal basis?",

Of course, as you explain, that legitimate interest is rather slim since newer browser privacy features limit the performance benefits of using shared CDNs.\n\nBack when GDPR came into force I removed most CDNs from my website, and doing it for fonts was fairly simple: download the files from Google Fonts and upload it on your website, while making sure to comply with the font licenses.

Captchas definitely reduce spam, though the user experience is pretty horrible. The important point from the GDPR perspective is that the captcha must have a purpose, legal basis, and that the captcha is an appropriate means of achieving the purpose. Challenges are not DIY territory so it makes sense to use an existing service, though I might point out that there's more than one provider. E.g. [Cloudflare stopped using ReCaptcha](https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-from-recaptcha-to-hcaptcha/) a year ago.",

For each client, there are probably 15 individuals who receive the publications by email. It is effectively an email distribution list like marketers would use, BUT we are given that information by the employers of the individuals who hold those institutional email addresses. Does that qualify as consent under GDPR, or do we need to go to each individual and say something like \"Hey your employer has subscribed you to this service.
