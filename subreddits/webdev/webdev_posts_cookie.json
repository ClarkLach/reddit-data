Am I the only one who thinks that the web has mostly just turned to shit?\n\nIt seems like every time you visit a new web site, you are faced with one of several atrocities:\n\n1. cookie warnings that are coercive rather than welcoming.\n2. sign up for our newsletter! PLEASE!\n3. intrusive geocoding demands\n4. requests to send notifications\n5. videos that pop up\n6. login banners that want to track you by some other ID\n7. carousels that are the modern equivalent of the <marquee> tag\n8. the 29th media request that hit a 404\n9. pages that take 3 seconds to load\n\nThe thing that I keep coming back to is that developers have forgotten that there is a human on the other end of the http connection. As a result, I find very few websites that I want to bookmark or go back to. The web started with egalitarian information-centric motivation, but has devolved into a morass of dark patterns. This is not a healthy trend, and it makes me wonder if there is any hope for the emergence of small sites with an interesting message.\n\nWe now return you to your search for the latest cool javascript framework. Don't abuse your readers in the process.",

Learned how to use hosting providers in the early 2000s.\n\nI remember, in the mid 1990s, one of the things we early folks said to one another was that we have to delay the \"real world\"--with all of its centralization, laws/rules, and limitations--from coming online as long as we could. That one day it would catch up and overtake this amazing new medium, especially once businesses got involved, if safeguards weren't taken. That point was passed long ago of course (I would pinpoint the IE6 monopoly years as a turning point), and if anything it's actually a bit worse than we predicted, with centralization even greater than anticipated and the dark patterns almost endless.\n\nI don't hate everything about the modern web/internet--I think it's cool we can do full apps on the web, which is what I do every day--but I do miss the spirit of those admittedly naive and even utopian early years.",

Number of notifications (and emails) sent is another useless people's favorite metric. Does it mean anything? Hell if anyone knows.\n\nVideos that pop up are totally what kids want these days. Bonus points if they are cringe as fuck stock videos hastily customized for your company (like every other marketing campaign your sorry marketing team has pooped out of their asses). It's just like TikTok!\n\nTracking we have to do, sorry. How else are we going to make up metrics to justify spending developers' time on useless features and vanity change requests? I can't inflate the metrics that don't exist, can I? Sadly, asking for consent is mandated by laws and regulations. You bet we'd skip that if we could.\n\nCarousels are the thing, too. It's one of the few UX terms I know so why not throw it around? See a nice, streamlined web page that delivers the information the user needs in a way that's pleasant to the eye? \"We need a carousel here. At the top. No, not like that! Larger! At least 75% of the viewport height.\" Man, I'm so good at those UX terms. Oh, we need space for that actually informative text? Make it expandable with a carrot icon.\n\n404s are fine. I'm checking if something exists, and 404 is the response. It's a perfectly fine response and not an error. Clean up non-existing URLs? Ain't no one got time for that. Gotta finish the latest useless feature.\n\nMore than 3 seconds to load? Yeah, man, I totally get you, it's not optimal, but we have to show that 2-second slash loader when the user enters our website. It's for our brand awareness. You wouldn't get it.",

The web is a global platform used by billions, as opposed to something like your local chess club newsletter or local-town weekly newspaper. When something gets that large, too, governments start weighing in on filtering/access/firewalling due to their own agendas.\n\nA lot of the issues arise because the initial platform starts out as just a technical protocol - there's nothing in the RFCs which look forward to potential global adoption and everyday use by the general public, and frame the technical specs in a way which will make it incredibly difficult for the digital polluters to spam their messages (or even for them to be able to be easily and quickly acted against, in ways where governments can't use those same methods to shut down people and groups who are politically inconvenient). Filtering needs to be available, but it needs to be ultimately controlled by the individual user, in such a way so that non-technical members of the public won't be overwhelmed by the administrative requirements. The protocol also needs to be able to inherently route around damage (including censoring and firewalls), but without being able to be firewalled itself just by blocking ports at borders, ISPs, or even in widespread OSes - if the US government tells Microsoft to send out updates to block X or Y port in all currently supported versions of Windows, for example, the platform/protocol needs to be able to render that moot.\n\nIt also can't be a privately-owned platform like Reddit; that's a shortcut to censorship both at the corporate level (for public image or in order to get paid by advertisers) and at the government level.\n\nOn top of THAT, you need to think about how you'd bypass potential government rulings (not just in your own country, but others) along the lines of \"All programs which use the HaHaCantCatchMe protocol/platform/encryption/whatever are illegal to own, operate, use, propagate, or create.\" And you need to think about how to handle fake end-clients which do use it, but also have backdoors for the manufacturers (or anyone else).\n\n---\n\nIt's one of those rabbit-hole things.

I know that sites need to do that to retain their traffic (or even increase it) and make money. But as a user I find it a poor experience if I am trying to read an article and I get some popup for even 2 seconds. Ruins the experience a lil bit.   \n2. Some sites where sign-in is mandatory. I just hate it. Mostly the education sites I have experienced do this. Why tf would I sign in before using your site. Atleast have the login/sign-in form after the content so that if the user feels, he does.\n\nAlso a personal take but I like simplistic and minimalistic sites.

The ads that were there could also be atrocious sometimes but it was just so the guy that hosted his own forum wouldn't sit on the cost. Websites with the goal to be a profitable business weren't many at that time. I mean sure, Myspace, yahoo, Google, forum hosting services and whatnot also existed, but when googling you still found a lot of those small blogs, instead of SEOd to death boring shit.",

The odds of getting one might be low, but some large businesses and some small business have been fined, and the fines are big.

This kind of thing already happens with certain copyright images, certain accessibility issues, etc.  So IMO it is worth the effort of shielding yourself by following the law.\n\n\n  \n\nIf you actually do it right, any relevant cookies should not have \"already loaded\".  You wait until they accept, and then if they do you run whatever tracking or analytics they opted into.  If you are tracking before they accept then you are obviously in violation of GDPR.\n\nYou can set *some* cookies without them accepting.  For example, a cookie that stores the status of if they accepted or denied the opt-in.  Or a session cookie that stores your auth token so you can log in or access whatever relevant data is behind your login.\n\n\n\nTracking cookies like you mention in your comments (GA, posthog, etc) are NOT necessary cookies and will put you in violation.  And no, you can't just declare them necessary, you will 100% lose big in court if you take that argument.

Yes, some people will not opt in and you will have less data. It's not the end of the world to not track every single user; you will get enough data from a representative sample that captures the trends.  \n\nThe banners are usually designed to pop up in a bit of an annoying way so people just quickly hit the accept button and you get some tracking data.\n\n\n\nSome sites do it wrong or not at all, and they are exposing themselves to some level of risk.

                "body": "When it comes to GDPR and similar privacy laws, clicking ‚ÄúDeny‚Äù is not just for show, it should have a real workflow behind it. If a user clicks ‚ÄúDeny,‚Äù your website must genuinely block non-essential cookies and tracking scripts (like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Posthog, or any third-party trackers) from being activated without explicit consent.\n\nIn practice, this means: \n\n1.  The consent process must be clear and detailed. Users should be able to opt in or out of specific cookie categories. A ‚ÄúDeny‚Äù click should immediately prevent those tracking functions from being executed.  \n2. It‚Äôs not enough to simply show a cookie banner with a ‚ÄúDeny‚Äù button. You need to ensure, technically, that non-essential cookies or trackers aren‚Äôt loaded as soon as the page fires up.  \n3. Storing the user‚Äôs decision (for instance, via a dedicated cookie) to remember that they said ‚Äúno‚Äù is acceptable. but only if it truly stops any unwanted tracking. \n4. Most importantly, it‚Äôs about respecting your users. If someone tells your site ‚ÄúNo thanks,‚Äù you honor that choice immediately. Otherwise, it‚Äôs not only poor practice, but it might also land you in trouble with regulators.\n\nJust think of it this way: the ‚ÄúDeny‚Äù button isn‚Äôt just there to make your legal department feel warm and fuzzy. it has to work as advertised. Otherwise, your site might end up being the digital equivalent of a restaurant that pretends to offer gluten-free options but secretly serves bread with gluten anyway. Not cool, and definitely not compliant. Germany is about to pass a law requiring a reject / deny button [link](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Administrative-court-Cookie-banner-must-contain-Reject-all-button-10390520.html). \n\nTL;DR: When a user clicks ‚ÄúDeny,‚Äù make sure your site genuinely stops non-essential cookies and tracking from running, because fancy banners without proper controls won‚Äôt keep the regulators off your back (or your users happy). \n\nFYI, I‚Äôm the creator of [c15t.com](http://c15t.com),",

Honestly I think it doesn't go nearly far enough and that we should have baked privacy concerns into the actual architecture of the web from the get go. But hindsight is 20/20 and security is very hard to do well as a result.\n\nThere are two reasons to think a company might be in compliance with GDPR:\n\n - They are the kind of company that is probably subject to pretty intense external security audits. Like financial institutions, gaming companies - basically anyone where if they lose their data or their IP then their entire business fails. \n\n - They are the kind of company that is either large enough to be a natural target for people enforcing the law at a national level, or they are a company with a lot of EU clients who match the description of the first type of company. \n\nExample: I was in charge of GDPR compliance when it first went into effect. I was told to punt completion on the work in favor of some bullshit marketing thing against my objections. We got a phone call from our largest EU client the next morning (Bosch) who ripped our security team a new asshole for not being in compliance. This did not in any way advance any part of my career.

GDPR is more meant to moderate the big corporate entities from owing you and your data.\n\nI work at an international media company, and GDPR compliance is a huge deal, so much so that the legal department needs to be involved when it comes to where and how we even store user data for our applications. Legal doesn't even want us saving user ui config settings (think: dark mode) in the US for EU users. There are a lot of cases where we build features, for US market only because of this. \n\nMany times we feel legal is overreacting, but to be fair on their part, being non-compliant could mean millions of dollars, so the play is always to be more cautious than not, even if it  impacts new features, and quality of life. And rollouts can happen slowly, esp if there is a noticeable improvement in revenue",

We design a website trying to make is as appealing and user friendly as possible and then we put that garbage on top we might as well draw doodly genitals on the Mona Lisa and force people to stare at it 5 times a day if they _don't_ want their data stolen.\n\nI don't know who makes up internet rules but whoever thought that 'just' having these popovers all over the place m and not declaring further explicite  requirements to maintain a positive experience would be a fine solution mustve been freaking high.\n\nEdit: I was just kind of venting, not expecting this to blew up lol. Still glad to see you people share this opinion. To those who state installing a work around, such as a plug in - you didn't really get my point. Yes, it may fix it for some or even most websites, but _having to_ install such workarounds can _also_ be considered a negative user experience. Same goes for \"immediately leaving the website\" - why have to open it to just close it to begin with. The problem is less about a \"specific\" website not being user friendly, but rather the general standards on the web.\nAnyway, tons of comments showing that it's not just about cookies but also registrations, newsletters, ads, etc. Even Google in incognito mode asks for cookies... Like... You want to read all that stuff about me but cannot realize that I'm incognito so there is no data for you to begin with... Why ask?",

Because as far as I know your users need to opt-in to *any* service that for example discloses their IP to a third party and provide a link to the privacy conditions of that third party so your users could at least potentially check out  what that third party would do with your IP (Do they store it? Do they sell the information that your IP just visited [hotkinkygrannies.com](https://hotkinkygrannies.com)?). \n\nAt the same time your users need to be able to opt-in and out of specific services: So they need to be able to accept getting their IP logged by youtube.com but not by [weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannyporn.com](https://weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannies.com) \n\nIf consenting was a browser setting, then your browser would need to create a list of all services you come across and save your preference for that particular service ‚Äì so effectively you'd only be asked *once* when you first encounter that service. Now the huge-ass list resulting from that wouldn't be such a big problem. But what could be a problem is this: Since most users only need to deny your third party service once and for all it will practically be burnt and useless soon. So I as a (hypothetical) third party service would then probably just move my service to a new domain so it registers as a new service with my browser every month or so (because we only can identify a service by the domain it's called from, can't we?). So maybe my code snippet that devs use to integrate my service would do something like getting the current MM-YY-date and call my service from my already setup domain [weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannyporn-06-22.com](https://weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannyporn.com) in June of 2022 and call the service again from [weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannyporn-07-22.com](https://weletpeopleknowwhomasturbatestogrannyporn-06-22.com) in the month after that and so on.\n\nDepending on my ROI I might even be able to secure a domain per day and then users would have to deny my service once every day. Of course this isn't as bad as having to deny or accept services on a per-website-basis but I guess people who are smarter than me could figure out a way, to make this appear on every website we visit, bringing us back to square one.",

And you can **only** store the cookies, AFTER it was accepted.\n\n/edit: These days the cookie-notice is just part of the gpdr-modal, if a gpdr modal is needed because of other data privacy related functions of your website.\n\ngpdr:\n\nWhenever you collect, aggregate or store \"private data\", or your Website use external services (via javascript or even include an image from an external service) you need the approve of the user. because the ip address is considered \"private data\" this is almost anytime needed. \n\nSome of the \"private data\" of the user can be flagged by yourself as \"needed\" or \"required\". This can be opt-in without the option to opt-out. Like a session-cookie or the ip-adress in serverlogs. When only those two options are the case, you don't need to \"shove it in the users face\" with a big modal. But a dark-pattern hidden icon or simple link to that information is not enough. More like a prominent Icon which opens the modal is enough. To be safe you can still require the modal to be accepted.\n\n----------\n\nLets assume:\n\n* You don't store ip adresses in logs or any type of watchdog or database-entry. There is no court ruling for pseudo-anonymised ip-adresses (like XXX.YYY.0.0 for the last two octetes), so its not legally safe. But somehow it is safe. Its a grey area.\n* You don't set cookies or anything else in the users browser.\n* You don't include any asset from another website. E.g. YT, fonts, javascripts from a CDN.\n* You don't have a contact form which sends emails to you.\n\nthen you don't need a cookie-banner or a gpdr banner. You just need to state in your \"data privacy\"-page that you don't do this.\n\n-----------\n\nBut, lets look at the lowest level most websites will have:\n\n* You have an serverlog with ip-adresses. If you don't know, ask your provider.\n* You set a cookie without any personal-data. Let's say a php-session-id. Even if you don't do anything with it.\n\nThen you need a gpdr-approve screen with one option:\n\n* \"Needed/Required\".  This can be default opt-in with no way to opt-out. And a text that states, that you set a cookie and store user-data (like ip-adress)\n\nAdditionally you must state in your \"data privacy\"-page that you store in your webserver-logs things like ip-adress with date, url, status-code. And how long you store this data and whom to contact to get it deleted. Also you must state that you set a cookie.\n\nIf you have no cookie, but the serverlogs you still need that section.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's mostly it. There is only ONE way for a Website to avoid that popup. And its not storing or aggregate ip-adresses anywhere and don't change any possible persistent data on the client (cookies, sql in browser).",

Or you have a UUID+ip-adress without session-cookie, but then you aggregate or compute \"private data\" and need the gpdr modal.\n\n> Can you track analytics that way for things like button clicks without a banner?\n\nThis is a really grey area. The law is so loosy written that \"private-data\" can be \"aggregated\" or \"computed\" without the need to opt-in or possibility to opt-out.\n\nYou can not (without consent) send the data to google analytics or similar services. Any data going to third-party must be approved. Even if you include an image from anywhere. then the users ip-adress will be logged on the server where you include the image from.\n\nBut you can declare \"server-logs with ip-adresses\" as \"needed/required\" to monitor your service. THEN you can declare, that you monitor your services with an self-hosted matomo (Not the cloud-version). Or any other self-hosted plattform. And because not needed you will anonymize the ip-adress in matomo and disable the matomo-session-cookie. (Rule to minimize all unneeded data as mandatory by gpdr).\n\nIn this set:\n\n* ip-adress in log\n* an self-hosted analyze-tool without cookies and anonimzed private-data (ip-adress)\n\nYou can have the \"not shoved in your face\" gpdr-modal.\n\nI know some organizations, that just import the webserver logs in their self-hosted matomo. No javascript tracking. So they know the clicked sites and some sort of user-tour, but its not THAT reliable. They need to state in the \"privacy\"-page that they aggregate that data, but that is all. No gpdr modal.\n\nSome organizations do it with javascript tracking on self-hosted matomo too without gpdr consent. But.... Maybe its not okay. Without a court-ruling in this case nobody knows if its okay.",

They make just as many client-side tags as a standard client-side tracking solution and instead point the data at their first-party endpoint.\n\ne.g. a whole bunch of GA4 Event tags that send data about individually tracked events to [metrics.example.com](http://metrics.example.com) instead of letting GA4 send data where it wants (region1.google-analytics.com and suchlike).",

The one thing that would be beneficial is a single first party cookie that stores a uuid.\n\nA pure server-side analytics solution, or a fully hosted solution that doesn't use a 3P provider's server, can have the benefit of better page load speed and fewer cookies (as well as smaller http requests).

But the bigger you are, the larger the risk of a thorough audit by a data protection agency. \n\nThe IP address issue is based on famous rulings where agencies and courts in Austria, Germany, France, and other EU countries found Google Analytics to be non-GDPR compliant because GA stored and transferred to overseas personally identifiable information, such as non-anonymized IP addresses. (Google Analytics has [solved this problem](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12017362?hl=en) on their part ever since.):\n\n> Austrian regulator ruled that in providing the Google Analytics service, the company collects and transfers personal data to the U.S. while failing to protect it from U.S. government surveillance. The DPA determined configuration abilities for customers, including truncating IP addresses, are insufficient to prevent re-identification, potentially by Google or the U.S. government. The decision also determined that supplementary measures implemented by Google, including government access transparency reports and encryption of data, were insufficient.\n\nhttps://dataprotectionprivacy.eu/en/google-analytics-found-to-be-non-compliant-with-the-gdpr/\n\nhttps://wideangle.co/blog/is-google-analytics-illegal-under-gdpr\n\nSome companies [even got fined](https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/swedish-watchdog-fines-tele2-for-gdpr-breaches/) for using the older version of GA which didn't have the EU specific measures:\n\n> The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) fined Tele2 SEK12 million ($1.1 million) for breaching GDPR rules, following an audit of how the operator used Google Analytics services. [...] The audit concerned a version of Google Analytics from 2020, when the initial complaint was filed. [...] The authority noted Tele2 recently stopped using Google Analytics, through which it transmitted personal data including IP addresses and cookies from web browsers to the US.\n\nWhat the auditors were looking at is when a US-based service or website sends their visitor's data to servers located in the US. In these situations that data is no longer protected from the US intelligence agencies:\n\n> The Schrems II ruling established that the personal data of EU residents cannot be transferred to foreign countries unless those countries have data privacy laws considered equivalent to the protections offered by the GDPR.\n\n> Google Analytics collects a number of granular data points that are specific to individuals; for example, what search terms they might have used to reach the webpage or what series of pages they clicked on while visiting. However, the Google Analytics panel is not supposed to tell the site administrator anything that identifies those users (beyond an extremely general location). Thus, use of it was widely considered to not be a risk for a GDPR violation.\n\n> However, the Austrian DPA found that the IP addresses and identifiers in cookie data were sufficiently personal to constitute a GDPR violation. The IP addresses can be anonymized, but this must be proactively requested by the Google Analytics user. The Austrian DPA said that the website it was examining, a health site based in Austria called netdoktor.at, had apparently attempted to enable anonymization but did not configure it correctly.\n\nhttps://www.cpomagazine.com/data-protection/austrian-dpa-finds-use-of-google-analytics-outside-of-eu-constitutes-a-gdpr-violation/\n\n> The Austrian DPA found that Google Analytics cookies used by an Austrian website allowed the collection and transfer of personal data to Google in the U.S., including user ID numbers, IP addresses, and browser settings. Moreover, the Austrian DPA found that the SCCs executed by the website operator and Google did not provide an adequate level of protection under the GDPR, as Google's proffered supplemental safeguards did not overcome the risk of U.S. surveillance activities identified in the CJEU's Schrems II ruling.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/data-collection-eu-troubled-waters-us-companies-2022-02-25/\n\nNow, based on all this, IP addresses are indubitably considered personal data so you at the very least need consent to store them, and you cannot transfer them to servers outside the EU where they are more vulnerable.",

The user must actively perform some kind of positive indication of informed consent, and just ignoring a chunk of text is not that.\n\nThis means, then, that a small banner simply won't do the trick: users will just ignore it and keep browsing around it, and you still can't track them because they have not agreed. And you can't deny them access either, because (see above) that's not allowed. Likewise, a dismissable banner is worthless, because dismissing does not imply consent, even if (see above) the banner has text in it saying \"by continuing, you agree...\". So if you're set on getting people to allow tracking, you have to be rather obnoxious about it - as obnoxious as you can be without stepping into outright illegality. Blocking access entirely is not allowed, but a large banner that covers all the interesting stuff and has a nice inviting green \"accept all\" button, and a pale transparent \"customize\" button that takes you to a large complex page with lots of frightful semi-legalese explanations and sixty switches that you need to turn off one by one as you scroll down 12 screenfuls of dread, that's borderline acceptable, and seems to be considered the current sweet spot.",

        "id": "15fgwq5",
        "selftext": "For years I have been doing embedded development and have always had an interest in learning more about the web. So recently I took to learning (and building) a modern web architecture - including the backend elements. Everything I have learned broadly makes sense to me - except *authentication*.\n\nWhat I've found is that common architectures use API *tokens* post-auth. So users authenticate with the backend and are given what is commonly referred to as *access* tokens (and possibly *refresh* tokens alongside it). The *access* token is then expected to be present in all future web requests often in a header like so:\n\n`Authorization: Bearer <token>`\n\nBut *why*? Why make your frontends more complex by requiring them to manage token persistence? Not requiring the user to login on each visit is the expected UX these days. But you get that ***implicitly*** with cookies, so I don't understand the need for API tokens at all.\n\n*\\*\\* And if the API is expected to be used with something other than a browser (e.g. some python code or whatnot) the semantics do not really change all that much. Perhaps even in this scenario the \\`Authorization\\` header makes sense .. but supporting this in the backend is trivial. My argument is mostly about the added complexity to a frontend.*\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The scenarios are:\n\n**For token-based auth:**\n\n1. User visits webpage\n2. Frontend queries localStorage for tokens to determine is user is authenticated\n3. In frontend: if authenticated goto 7 else render login form\n4. User authenticates with backend\n5. Backend sends API token in body of response\n6. Frontend stores token in e.g. localStorage (step 2 now will succeed and skip re-auth)\n7. Frontend renders authenticated pages\n8. For each subsequent request frontend explicitly sets \\`Authorization\\` header with token\n\n**For cookie-based auth:**\n\n1. User visits webpage\n2. Frontend queries e.g. /api/users/whoami on first render (browser sends any cookies present)\n3. Backend reads/validates cookies and responds with some body content indicating auth (or not)\n4. In frontend: if authenticated goto 8 else render login form\n5. User authenticates with backend\n6. Backend sets auth cookie and responds with success message\n7. Browser implicitly retains cookie  (step 2 now will succeed and skip re-auth)\n8. Frontend renders authenticated pages\n9. For each subsequent request frontend does nothing (cookies are implicitly sent by browser)\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# How I see their securities stack up:\n\n**Token-based:**\n\n* XSS can read localStorage and exfiltrate the token (there are ways to mitigate this)\n* XSS can just use its execution to make authenticated API requests\n* No cookies, no CSRF\n\n**Cookie-based**\n\n* XSS can just use its execution to make authenticated API requests\n* Has cookies, but (should be) using \\`HttpOnly\\`/\\`Samesite\\`/\\`Secure\\` mitigates CRSF\n\nNot to mention with cookie-based auth your frontend can be simpler by offloading auth management to the backend, effectively; the \"on first render\" request instructs the frontend on if it should attempt to render authenticate pages or just redirect to the login page (due to bad/corrupted/expired credentials). Whereas with the token-based approach you have added XSS attack surface *and* are necessarily adding more complexity to your frontend.\n\nIf you opt to use something like request interceptors, or web workers to isolate access to your token by retaining it in-memory (and so XSS cannot explicitly *read* it out for exfiltration) then the token-based approach improves to be roughy equivalent with the cookie-based auth anyway (i.e. the first bullet does not apply).\n\n**The** ***only*** **downside I see to cookie-based auth as described above is that your frontend is required to make a web request on first render** to e.g. /api/users/whoami in order to determine its user data and whether or not the backend has validated the authenticated session. It is conceivable that at-scale these extra web requests may be undesirable.\n\nAgain, I am quite new to web development but this is something that stuck out to me during my studies. I have no issue being wrong here - but I simply do to understand the benefit of token-based authentication. Before \\`HttpOnly\\` and \\`SameSite\\` were a thing, and use of cookies was very insecure, I do understand the motivation. But given modern mitigations I just don't quite see the intent.",

This server client direct relationship isn't always the case In bigger more complex enterprise architecture.\n\nJWT authentication can be more flexible and is good in situations where you have multiple APIs, multiple different pages or mobile apps using the same APIs.\n\nFor example. A large company might have 8 different APIs maintained by different teams written in different languages. A company like this will roll one authentication server that deals with all the Auth and dishes out all the tokens. That means once you have a token you have a common interface to communicate with all the APIs securely. \n\nThere are patterns that involve an API gateway that acts as the front door to all of your APIs. Cookie based is very limiting in what you can achieve. JWT means that pretty much anything can call your APIs securely not just browsers.\n\nCookies don't work in Native apps too. The process you are used to with the apps on your phone keeping you logged in is a JWT refresh Oauth flow. It would mean maintaining an Auth server on top of a cookie based Auth flow for your webpage. Which doesn't make sense so you just use JWT and either Oauth/OpenID etc for everything. \n\nTo summarize cookies great, secure easy. Token based is way more flexible/interoperable but probably worse in every other aspect.",

I use API tokens for backend to backend communication, but I think in most cases frontend to backend is better handled with cookies and a simple text token (not a JWT).\n\nedit : one valid usecase is if you build a mobile app that will consume the same api as your website, since your mobile app most likely can't use cookies.",

HTTP-only cookies are one way to handle authentication and have certain advantages. They are relatively simple to implement and automatically included with every HTTP request made from the client to the server. They also provide some protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks since they can‚Äôt be accessed via JavaScript.\n\nHowever, token-based authentication (JWT for instance) is also popular and has its own advantages. It is often used in RESTful APIs due to its statelessness and scalability. It can be used across different domains, and it‚Äôs flexible to work with mobile, web, or other third-party applications. Token auth is also more suitable for single-page applications (SPAs), where the server doesn‚Äôt need to keep track of sessions, making it more efficient and scalable.\n\nIn the end, whether to use token-based authentication or cookie-based authentication often depends on the specific needs and context of your application.‚Äù",

Cookies are a part of that, but in reality, cookies are only mentioned 3 times in the whole GDPR. There are other ways to track users, such as fingerprinting, and this also goes against the GDPR if there is not informed consent.\n\nWhat it does say can be boiled down to a few simple points though:\n\n* Tracking should be an informed opt-in. This would mean that without action, tracking users is not enabled. Cookies are obviously the main way to be tracked, but that doesn't mean that all cookies are being used for that. Just show the option to opt-in to those tracking cookies that are used, anything that the site relies on for functionality are fine.\n* Opting out should be as easy as opting in. So, if you have some kind of 'accept all' button, you need a similar 'reject all' button as well.\n\nBeyond that, there are a lot of ways to approach these things with good UX in mind. Also, good UX will have a lot of overlap with decent accessibility as well. I wrote an article about this earlier in the year, but I don't think the rules allow me to post the link. Basically, follow these points:\n\n* Try to make it an inline thing or a banner, rather than a popup modal. Modals are not great for accessibility, and if you followed the GDPR requirements, the user should not be forced to accept/reject being tracked anyway, as it's opt-in by action as the default.\n* Don't disguise the buttons as tiny links.\n* Don't force the user to have to click through a hundred individual radio buttons/toggles to change their preferences.\n* Legitimate interest is greatly abused and misused by advertisers, just avoid it.\n* Changing preferences should be as easy to opt out as to opt in.\n* For accessibility purposes, make sure that any of the interactive parts are keyboard accessible, have the right accessible labels (added via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`), and have the right accessible roles (best to use the correct existing HTML elements where possible, otherwise you can use `role` to fill in the gaps)\n* A final point on the accessibility, try to avoid only colours to indicate meaning. The biggest offenders I see for this are cookie banners with toggles where the toggle just changes colour when switching between on/off modes. Depending on different types of colour blindness, that toggle change might be effectively invisible.",

This means the user has requested to store the cookie to stay logged in for a longer time.\n\nIf the user doesn‚Äôt click the \"Remember Me\" checkbox, then they can only stay logged in until they close the browser or remain inactive for some time. After that, it will ask them to reauthenticate again because no cookie was saved, and the session has expired.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs say the user deletes that cookie ID from their browser. In that case, the user only loses the extended login time (the \"Remember Me\" plan). They will still stay logged in until the session expires.\n\nPersonally, I think the original asker should consider this: if their program didn‚Äôt receive a cookie in its HTTP request, the user might have logged in from a public internet connection and chose not to save the cookie by not checking the \"Remember Me\" checkbox. Or, if the user is familiar with the browser‚Äôs developer tools, they might have accidentally checked the \"Remember Me\" option but later deleted the cookie ID to stay safe.\n\nAnyway, cookies and sessions are very different. A cookie is just a key stored on the user‚Äôs device, which we use to identify them. A session is similar to a cookie but is only active until the browser or device is closed or not used for a certain period.\n\nOn each request, my program checks if a session is found. If not, it checks if a cookie is found. If a cookie is found, it re-creates the session and lets the user stay logged in again.

Technically not all are cookies some are session IDs like **PHPSESSID**.\n\nFor example if the website is built in PHP most of the time there is a cookie stored in the user device with the name **PHPSESSID**.  \n  \nI assume you know that **HTTP** is stateless, which means the browser & server not knowing each other after they make request and response each other.\n\nSo that's way the server has to store something in the user's device to track the user across pages, and that is the **PHPSESSID** cookie when its comes to PHP website. If you deleted that ID, then yes you will be logged out, you basically deleted your given session ID. If you deleted the another cookie ID that let you stay logged in the system then you will be logged out immediately.\n\nSo Yes this **PHPSESSID** is a cookie in the user device while it is used as a session ID on the Server side. As by default is expired like session.\n\n**PHPSESSID** is created when we use `session_start()` function.  \nHowever, when we want to use an actual cookies to let the user stay logged in for longer period of time, we have to create real cookie with set of longer expiration time using `setcookie()` function.   \nAnd that is considered an actual cookie.",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around a situation where we have the below flow, and feel like i'm missing something. What happens if a refresh token is stolen, and the real user does not attempt to use their original refresh token until after it is expired? This is in the situation where a user can log in on multiple devices / browsers, so multiple Refresh Token chains could exist.\n\n`Real Actor := RA, Malicious Actor := MA, Refresh Token (1day) := RT, Access Token (15min) := AT.`\n\n1. RA logs in, and receives AT1 and RT1 stored in secure, HTTP cookies. RT1 is written to database for revocation/reuse detection purposes.\n2. MA steals RT1 and uses this to refresh the access token. MA receives AT2 and RT2. RT2 is written to database, and RT1 is marked as revoked.\n3. MA continues to act maliciously,.. MA receives AT7 and RT7. RT7 is written to database, and RT2-RT6 are marked as revoked.\n4. RA does not perform any activity until after their RT1 has expired.\n\nI understand that if RA used their RT1 prior to it expiring, then we would detect that they are using a revoked RT and then proceed with revoking all RTs, nullifying the impact of the malicious actor. However if RA does not use their RT until after the cookie expires, then when they go to use it they'll be forced to sign in again, and receive a new RT and start a new RT chain, but the existing RT chain that the malicious actor has will remain valid...\n\nWhat am I missing here?\n\n**Edit:**\n\n* Is the answer not having the cookie that stores the refresh token (a JWT) expire? If this is the case, do we then just not worry about the JWT having expired (ie jwt.decode not jwt.verify when getting the JTI to look up in the database) when checking if it is a re-use?\n* A secondary question, if the real actor never interacts back with the server, or does so on a totally new device (and therefor new refresh token chain), is there anyway to stop the malicious actor from continuing to act, or is it only if the real actor hits a 'log-out of all devices' button?",

DPoP is a bit easier to implement, while mTLS is a bit stronger. Both provide techniques to \"pin\" tokens to a specific device. Neither is 100% bulletproof but both complicate the token-theft pathway so much that to my knowledge, there are no documented cases of either system being compromised in a production app. (But don't take my word for it of course, confirm this.)",

However, users must still be informed about their use in a cookie policy or privacy policy.\n2. **Analytics Without Cookies**: If you gather analytics server-side without setting additional cookies, this avoids the need for consent typically associated with analytics cookies. However, GDPR still requires you to:\n   * Be transparent about data collection (e.g., in your privacy policy).\n   * Justify the data processing under a lawful basis such as **legitimate interest**.\n   * Minimize data collection to what is necessary for your stated purpose.\n3. **A/B Testing**: Tracking A/B testing versions via session cookies can qualify as strictly necessary if it is essential for delivering the service users expect (e.g., ensuring they see a consistent version of your site during a visit).\n\n# CCPA Considerations\n\n1. **Session Cookies and Analytics**: Under CCPA, session cookies used for functionality or analytics collected directly by you (not involving third-party tools) are typically not considered a sale of data. However, you must:\n   * Disclose that you collect analytics data in your privacy policy.\n   * Provide a mechanism for users to opt out of data collection if the data is considered personal information.\n2. **A/B Testing**: Similar to GDPR, if the data collected is necessary for providing the service (e.g., ensuring users experience the same A/B testing variant), it is unlikely to trigger additional obligations. Still, you should disclose it transparently.\n\n# Do You Need a Cookie Banner?\n\n* **No Cookie Banner Required**: If the cookies used are strictly necessary, and no analytics or tracking cookies are set, a cookie banner is not required under GDPR.\n* **Transparency Required**: Both GDPR and CCPA require you to explain in your privacy policy:\n   * The types of data collected (e.g., analytics data, session tracking).\n   * The purposes for which the data is processed.\n   * Users' rights (e.g., access, deletion, or opting out under CCPA).\n\n# Key Steps to Ensure Compliance\n\n1. **Privacy Policy**: Clearly state:\n   * What data is collected (e.g., session cookies, analytics data).\n   * Why it is collected and how it is used (e.g., A/B testing, site functionality).\n   * User rights (opt-out under CCPA, access, or deletion).\n2. **Avoid Non-Essential Cookies**: If you don‚Äôt use cookies for analytics or third-party tracking, this simplifies compliance significantly.\n3. **Lawful Basis**: For GDPR, rely on a lawful basis like legitimate interest for server-side analytics and strictly necessary cookies.\n\nBy sticking to these practices, you avoid the need for a cookie banner while still meeting the transparency and accountability obligations under GDPR and CCPA.",

Hope I can shine a little more light here. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything further.\n\n>Essential Cookies: Cookies used solely to maintain sessions and ensure functionality (like tracking A/B testing variations)I believe ChatGPT is giving you an incorrect definition of essential cookies here. \n\nUnless I'm misunderstanding your product, if you turn off tracking A/B testing, ***the site will still work and the user experience during that session wouldn't be impinged.*** If so, these are not essential cookies; they would rather fall under persistent cookies (aka tracking cookies). These absolutely do require informed consent, and you would need a cookie banner for this. \n\nIn general, essential cookies tend to do things like keeping someone signed in during the session or retaining their language choices. The two rules of thumb I follow are:\n\n* if the cookie doesn't expire at the end of the session, i.e. there is data left over after a person finishes a session, it's likely not essential to the session. You'll need consent.\n* If the cookie is not there to enable the user to use your site, it's not essential to the user, it's just important to you. You'll need consent.\n\n>I also don't understand the consequences of not following those laws if I'm not in California or Europe, so I'd like to understand this and make sure I am compliant without doing needless feature work.\n\nSo, it's actually not about where you are; the laws aren't protecting you, they're protecting the citizens of their region.\n\n* If you collect personal data from a citizen of the EU, you'll need to follow the rules set by the GDPR.\n* If you collect personal data from US citizens in California, you'll need to follow the CCPA / CPRA.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcing fines, that's when things become a little more technical and you'll have to do your own reading. But your service could absolutely be banned in the EU, and in my opinion that risk isn't worthwhile when compliance softwares tend to be barely a few dollars a month and, in some cases, offer lifetime licenses. \n\n>It is also my understanding that sites that prompt those annoying cookie banners aren't really complying with the law.\n\nNot exactly - if you see a site with a cookie banner, it just means they're using non-essential cookies and requesting your consent to use them. By having the banner - assuming the banner is actually compliant and blocks scripts automatically - they are simply doing their best to comply with the law.\n\nEnd of the day, your product is a tracking software and your service is now highly regulated. But it's still incredibly useful, and you'll find more than 50% of people still consent to cookies anyway. As a marketer by trade, your product looks to be in the best interest of the internet and user experience - keep at it, just don't ignore compliance(!\n\nHope this helps :)\n\nAlistair",

It may be that the browser you were testing with doesn't remove the cookies immediately, but upon the closing of the tab/window. It might not be very efficient to constantly monitor cookie expiry times and be ready to remove them, so moving that kind of cleanup to a one off would make more sense.\n\nNow, there are some cookies that you can't remove from the client side, specifically cookies marked as HTTP only. For cookies like these, they can only be removed on the server (as ChatGPT indicated). However, they can't just be removed by _any_ server, they can only be removed by the domain they belong to. So, if you have 3rd party cookies, you would have no control over being able to delete them yourself.\n\nWhat you _should_ do, is get the users consent _before_ you start running any 3rd party code that tracking the user (this covers tracking by cookies and other means, like fingerprinting, etc).\n\nOnly if the user consents should you enable these tracking tools. But, if the user ever removes that consent again, you must also remove those tracking tools again.",

                "body": "JWTs are great. They solve some very specific problems in a really clever way. What they aren‚Äôt, is easy to deal with.\n\nSo if you don‚Äôt have those problems and are not likely to ever have those problems, you don‚Äôt need JWTs.\n\nThese are the problems:\n\nImagine you are building a complicated application, for example a video streaming service like Netflix. You don‚Äôt build it as a monolith, instead you have a load of smaller services.\n\nYou have an authentication server. You have a server which handles account settings and billing. You have a recommendation service that gives personalised recommendations, and you have a DRM service that grants keys. And you don‚Äôt use JWTs.\n\nWhat happens when a user logs in to watch a video?\n\nFred Bloggs logs in so the app makes a request to the auth server with his username and password.\n\nThe auth server checks the username and password. So creates a row in a table with Fred's user ID and a session token.\n\nThe token is a GUID, it has no meaning, but it is the identifier for the logged in session.\n\nThe app gets the session token and then makes a request to the billing server to ensure that Fred is still paid up.\n\nThe server gets the token, it then makes a request to the auth server to find out who that is. The auth server looks up the session in the database and responds that it is Fred. The billing server then checks its own database for Fred‚Äôs account and confirms to the app that Fred is signed up\n\nThe app then hits the recommendation service with the token to get a list of recommended shows/most recently watched so that it can render the menu. The recommendation service takes the token and makes a request to auth to see who that belongs to. Once it knows it is Fred, it generates the appropriate response for him.\n\nFred chooses a particular video. The app makes a request to the DRM service which hits auth to find out who owns that token, once it knows it is Fred, it makes a request to the billing service to verify that Fred has a valid subscription for that video, once it has confirmed this, it generates the appropriate keys to return to the app.\n\nFred now watches his video.\n\nYou‚Äôll notice that there was an awful lot of one service making requests to other services. The auth service spent more time responding to request asking ‚Äúwho is this person‚Äù than it did actually authenticating.\n\nThis is what JWT solves. Instead of responding with a meaningless token, the auth server responds with a bit of information that says ‚Äúthis is Fred Bloggs, He is user ID 987654321. He has a subscription to the all-access plan valid until 31st January 2025‚Äù and then digitally signs that so that whoever gets the token can simply verify the signature and immediately have that information and know it is correct.\n\nThat saves much of the communication between servers, and indeed, if the Auth server goes offline after Fred has logged in, it doesn‚Äôt matter, as he can still use his current token until it expires.\n\nNow if you don‚Äôt have multiple services, then JWT doesn‚Äôt solve any problems for you - you don‚Äôt need it.\n\nMany (arguably most) web applications happily run on a single server and often the database is on the same server, so latency for database lookups is tiny. In these cases using a simple session system that most web frameworks provide is quite sufficient\n\nTLDR: You probably don't need JWT, just use your frameworks session/token system instead.",

More complex mechanism on client, and also it's less secure since the data put on client instead of staying in server.  \n  \nuse JWT if you want your client able to present user data to other server not connected to your database (could be your other service or third party).

Cookie is simply a mechanism for storing tokens in the browser, and local storage is another way browsers store information.\n\nAt their core, both JWT and session provide users with a credential for identity verification.  \nThe difference is that session records this credential and its corresponding user relationship on the server. So if you want to invalidate the credential, you can simply delete the corresponding relationship.\n\nJWT uses a secret key to sign the credential, and only the server possesses this key. This ensures users cannot modify the credential, eliminating the need for the server to store the credential-user relationship and thus reducing server workload.  \nHowever, the drawback is that the credential cannot be invalidated at will.\n\nAnother characteristic of JWT is that, although it appears random, anyone can decode and view the content recorded in the JWT‚Äîbut they cannot modify it.\n\nYou can encode and decode JWTs on the following website:  \n[https://jwtdecode.pro/](https://jwtdecode.pro/)  \nYou'll notice that decoding a JWT doesn‚Äôt require a secret key, but encoding does.  \nThis means everyone can see the information inside a JWT.\n\nIn contrast, session-stored information can be encrypted. The server then decrypts it when retrieving session data via cookies.  \nHowever, in most cases, a session simply stores a meaningless random string, and the server can query the corresponding user from a lookup table.\n\nIn practice, many sessions also adopt JWT's signing mechanism.

This is the easiest to implement, but sharing the secret widely is a security risk.\n\nAsymmetric (or public key) is much better, and generally used in larger orgs. There are two keys in this, a private key (held only on the auth server) which is used to sign it, and a public key which is held on all other services, and it doesn't matter if it is leaked, since you can't do anything harmful with it. It is a little harder to set up, but only marginally.\n\nFor revocation you would generally use a system where the token is not terribly long lived - maybe 10 minutes, and you have a renewal mechanism whereby a client with an expired token can exchange it for a new one with the auth server. That is where revocation can be checked and the auth server can refuse to issue a new token, forcing the user to re-log in. So, you've now got additional calls, but in the scenario I mentioned 10 minutes is probably long enough to complete all actions (well depending on how decisive Fred is - I can spend half an hour scrolling through Netflix for something to watch so I'd probably have to renew tokens twice).",

As well as api keys are used for identification, not authorization.\n- Telling them to remove important keys or public data which does not need keys in the first place\n- The session id cookie attribute like HttpOnly is managed by the backend, a frontend dev does not try to touch that. If it is readible from the console, then it is the backend job to make it encrypt/sign it or setting it as httponly, secure, samesite=strict?\n- Telling the devops to build me a Proxy backend if he still doesn't want users to see the real backend api links\n\n\nI also want to clarify that I am an intern, my framework is already chosen and printed on my school paper, I chose React so changing to NextJs might not be possible. Also comments related to env files, you are missing the point, my devops wants me to hide the API Link in the sources tab too.\n\nIf this doesn't work out i might as well send him this reddit post.\n\n===================================================\n\nFinal update: I explained to my manager and he got the gist. I will remove the cookie and make a basic nodeJS proxy backend for my frontend. Thank you everyone for the help!",

There has to be _some_ backend that your landing page can hit, and obscuring it is not the same as securing it.\n\nAs an alternative solution, I figure your landing page is being served from _somewhere_ and there must be something running server side to fetch the landing page. If they won't give you a backend, I'd investigate what this is and see if you can potentially do the API call there, and inject the response into the HTML that is returned.\n\nFor example, if there's a PHP / Node server that's running and serving the code, you can add the API call to that before the page is returned to the user, and set the response in a window variable: [gist](https://gist.github.com/jacretney/9a9d585ab40ee02efbae55853aec5b2d)\n\nHowever, this only works \"if\" there is a backend already in place which is serving the site. If there isn't, and there's just an nginx proxy (or equivalent) then you're back to square one. \n\nTo do what they're asking (from the sound of it) you need a backend to do the internal API call for you. In which case, you'd need to discuss with them setting up a small backend you can call from the frontend, or setting up a backend which serves the content and does what I've described as above.\n\nHope this helps!",

If the browser is making a request, the URL, session ID, headers, etc. will be visible in the Network tab. There‚Äôs no real way around that.\n\nThere is a lot of unclear needs and unspoken assumptions behind this... It feels a bit like and \"X/Y problem\" and they have a hard time expressing \"why and what problem are we trying to solve?\".\n\nIf your DevOps engineer wants you to \"hide the session ID\", what they probably mean is: \"Don't expose it to the frontend at all.\"\n\nIn that case, it should be stored in a secure, HttpOnly cookie - that way it's sent with requests automatically, but isn't accessible via JavaScript and doesn't show up in window, localStorage, or your app code. It is of course possible to get at it if a malicious process gains access to the memory on the device - but then someone is already screwed. Unless they are talking about 3rd party API keys, because then it becomes trickier.\n\n3rd party API keys and internal secrets should live only on the server-side. If the user interface/app needs to talk to a 3rd party API it should either go through your own server-side backend/proxy/gateway, which attaches the secret and forwards the request - or there should be some kind of scoped token (or similar) that temporarily gives that user (or device) limited access to the 3rd party API. The second option is often solved through SSO or similar with oauth or OIDC.\n\nIf you're not sure what kind of auth flow is intended, I think that you should ask some clarifying questions that can help move the conversation forward:\n\n* \"Do we want users to be logged in to our system and scoped via a JWT?\"\n* \"Should we store sessions or tokens in HttpOnly cookies so they aren't exposed in the frontend?\"\n* \"Can we proxy this API through the server-side to avoid putting internal secrets in the frontend?\"\n* \"Do we want to give the user interface/app access to a 3rd party API, or are we only talking about access to our APIs?\"",

Even if user extract it, it is his personal one so no harm done.

Either way, you're sending some sort of session key. \n\nKeep pushing them until you understand exactly what they're using. You're an intern, not a senior dev. Its expected for you to not know things. \n\nAre there other apps you can look at to see how it's being done? If this is the first, you want to use oauth2 and talk with them about what is needed to do that.",

If you know your going to have hundreds of thousands of requests per hour, then maybe a dedicated VPS/Be would be cheaper. But that down to you DevOps guy.

This bypasses the same-origin policy restrictions.\n\nAnother approach is to use local subdomains. You can modify your `hosts` file to map subdomains like `portal1.local` or `portal2.local` to `localhost`.

        "selftext": "I'm a digital nomad, all my sites are offshore and my business model isn't based in the US, UK, EU or other jurisdiction that implemented these draconian cookie popup consent laws that have killed the UI experience of the Internet since 2018. \n\nI personally hate the GDPR popups. They detract from my user experience, and I'm sure I'm not the only one that finds them annoying.\n\nIn order to give a more positive user experience with less distractions to my users, I'm thinking of not placing any cookie notification popups anywhere on my sites. What's the worse that could happen considering my sites aren't based within any jurisdiction that introduced these draconian laws? Will I be whisked away in a black jet to a private detention center?\n\nSerious insights appreciated as opposed to whether or not implementing these cookie popups is \"moral\" or not, thanks.\n\nUpdate: I just want to clarify I am vehemently against 3rd party cross-site tracking for data harvesting and advertising purposes without consent. I'm also against popups of all forms as I find them intrusive and don't wish to subjugate my users to them either. I personally don't use cookies to track my users any further than is needed for the functionality of the website they're on, and hence why I don't wish to display any annoying cookie notices. Personally I use adblockers and cookie blockers and only opt-in to cookies that I desire by myself through these extensions. When a website bothers me with additional cookie popups, it impacts my user experience negatively.\n\nUpdate 2: These cookie popups destroy the UI experience without doing anything positive because if users didn't want to give consent for cookies, they could just install an adblocker, like I do. If they want a site to use cookies, they can turn the adblocker off for that site. This is a simple solution that doesn't destroy the UI experience of the Internet. I stand by what I said: Requiring cookie consent confirmation is a terrible concoction by politicians with little thought as to how this extra action on *every single website you visit* (which often doesn't remember your selection) affects user experience.

It's been known as the \"cookie-law\" since that's what everyone seemingly latched on to. But really, all of this only really applies what websites can do without special consent.

The GDPR is rendered useless if the consent process is ineffective. \n\nI think the GDPR should have focused on getting browser and OS vendors to properly implement system-wide privacy settings that can be transmitted in the form of HTTP request headers (such as the DNT/GPC headers), parameters in OAuth handshakes and JWT auths, etc. that would allow for a completely unobtrusive privacy setting that can be transmitted under the hood once it has been clearly set by the user in their browser settings (or in the case of apps, their OS). Things like DNT headers already had definition, and some browsers already had settings for them. The problem is no one respected the setting. The GDPR should have required that they be honored, and expanded on the proposed DNT header standard with something like the GPC. The GPC is relatively new and is aimed at *trying* to be GDPR compliant. That type of standard should have been defined, documented, and made mandatory from the start. It wasn't mandatory because it didn't exist. It's like trying to put the cart before the horse. This is what happens when bureaucrats talk law before talking implementation. And now we have a clusterphuck. A. Total. Clusterphuck.",

I also think Its hilarious to read the shit that law firms post on the topic, because naturally all of the American law firms just want everyone to lick the EU's ass crack to sip the chocolate bullshit leaking out of it. They totally forget about the fact it's not exactly easy for foreign countries to enforce asinine policies on other sovereign countries.

If the site requires a user/pass login, then a cookie may be stored for persistence so the user doesn't need to login continuously. All other stored data is only what they've entered on the site itself. That's it. From a moral standpoint I think that's fine and was fine pre-2018.

Let me try with an extreme example.\n\nLets say you run a site called GeminiiNews.com. It's fairly successful, you break even after salaries and expenses and your income comes from advertising like a vast majority of online news sites. Your ad blocker rate is around 20% (the rough average though it varies by industry) but you make enough to get by. Lets hypothetically say Chrome has a built in ad blocker now that's on by default; Google would never but this is to demonstrate the point. Your income would obviously drop off a cliff. You see your competitors, other news sites, are also dropping off in ad revenue. After all, what advertiser would want to be on your site if the ads aren't ever going to show?\n\nSo now your main source of revenue is out. Now every visitor is no longer a chance at revenue (roughly 80% chance before) but is now almost certainly just an expense in bandwidth and server resources. \n\nSo you only allow people without the ad blocker on you use your site, and this might work if all of the other sites do this too. But the other option is now everything is behind a paywall. Now there is virtually no free news other than sites specifically for propaganda (they are just there for misinformation and not revenue anyhow), and only those who have money can get access to news.\n\nNow those would be the business choices of the owner that you would be okay with, but eventually the common denominator keeps dropping until that's the only way expenses can be paid: behind a paywall or overturn the ad blocking movement. Then it's not a matter of just going somewhere else, society's information has now been pay-walled and the internet is now a place for those who can afford it, and have access to internet, and can also afford the access; it was bad enough when the problem was just the last two.\n\nMy larger point is that advertising, and the understanding of \"You show me ads, I get your content/service\" is what made the modern internet possible today by giving everyone a way to get access without having to shell out cash. And this goes beyond just internet services. There have been huge ups and downs with virus attack vectors and such, but a lot of that (at least for now) is a minimal concern with modern browsers and operating systems. The ad blocker movement, from where I sit, if it keeps growing has the only inevitable conclusion that not only will ISPs charge, but they also content providers, making the disenfranchised even more so.",

The other benefit is that it gets updates more often compared to uBO.\n\nNano Defender is a companion extension that expands the blocking capabilities, with it, you don't even need an extension for blocking intrusive Pop-Up windows as you would normally do.\n\nI've been using Nano Adblocker + Nano Defender for about a year and it's nice, you hardly notice they are there.\n\nuBlock Origin is by no means bad at all, in fact before I found out Nano Adblocker, I regarded uBO as the best, now it's the second best.

First, a lot of ad blockers look for key words, such as a div called \"ad-slot\" and they will block render of that div content. Second, almost no one at scale can do that. Even those not at scale won't.\n\nLets pretend we have giant company XYZ. They have many sites, many domains, many product, and therefore many ads. Even if they own and direct sell all of those ads (and they wouldn't, will get to that later) any logical architect will try to consolidate that ad delivery under something like ads.xyz.com. To have several independent ad delivery networks, or try to get clever with DNS around it, would be a nightmare. \n\nNext, companies as large as XYZ could afford to have their own ads team to manage inventory, sales, operations, etc. But even them an ad platform like Google Ad Manager will be extremely more efficient than whatever a company could make on their own. Almost all companies are moving to these platforms for ubiquity for them and the customers. \n\nBut even then if you are NOT a company as large as XYZ, you can't afford ad sales, ad ops, and making your own ad delivery platform and you rely on those third party ad delivery providers to do all that for you. Those providers are largely the reason why small sites can afford to support themselves.\n\nIt's a sticky situation, and I am sad bad ad experiences has ruined it sometimes, but I am still stuck that blocking ads is directly moving away from what can make the internet free and open.",

I agree there should be warnings and control over cookies. That just seems natural that some level of awareness is present in society that we're all being tracked for (insert slew of purposes here) and this awareness is the baseline for action. The *control* in the browser is somewhat lacking. There needs to be more controls to allow the functionality that cookies bring without using cookies explicitly, in that we can define authentication functionality separate from other cookie usage. oAuth and Passkey are great examples of steps in the right direction. Abusing cookies just to manage authentication and state seems like it sort of? is backfiring? Anyhow.\n\nI'm going to be more explicit (unfortunately not a great user interface/experience feature) now with stating the intentions of my site's cookie usage; Essentially we just need to say, 'Hey, heads up. In order to register an account here, we need your consent to use a cookie for such a purpose'. At least until I fully implement oAuth and Passkeys. I digress.\n\nAnyone else having to deal with cookie banners, cookies in general, or just have thoughts on them?",

Specifically look at the Request Headers. You'll see your user agent string, any cookies associated with the website's domain, and more. Every byte of that header is sent to the web server and every user's browser will send similar, but different data.\n\nYour server could take that data, normalize it and hash it, and you'd get a naive fingerprint of the visitor. But that's not enough to uniquely identify returning visitors. With a large enough user base, multiple users could produce the same fingerprint. Further, if the user changes some browser settings, their requests headers could change. That's what happens if they delete their cookies. They could use a different browser, or go incognito. The headers might change when the browser software updates. And so on. \n\nSo you have to go deeper.\n\nYou could write some JavaScript that runs on the user's browser, then observe its behavior. For example, you can have the browser transcode a short audio sample then hash the results. This will produce different results for different users. ~~Or you could time how long their browser takes to perform a series of computations, the results of which are affected by their particular mix of hardware, browser software and operating system.~~ You might be able to interrogate which browser features are enabled or which extensions are installed. All of those things could be used to help identify a user.\n\nBut all of those things are unreliable, and many of them could be considered invasive. \n\nIf your business model relies on this, then you should know the technique might work well enough for many users, but it won't work reliably for all users. Be sure it's legal, and decide if it's moral.\n\nEdit: strike out an oversimplification.",

This, to me, indicates using this service is not cheap.

Google tag manager, as example, has a way for you to record events, and get the data out -- but it's into google-centric tooling. It even has an event for cookie acceptance, if needed.\n\nYou can implement some of this yourself, but you need to either send the data to a third party service, or write something custom to injest it into your own database. One could call \"bigquery\" (where things like this wind up in Google land) your own database...

If the user has already stepped-up the authentication they won't reprompt for MFA again. As an attacker, if you steal a session that's been stepped up you can go to town and do whatever you like.\n\nThere's also the suggestion of tying the session to the IP as well. IP can change pretty frequently but you can at least limit it to the geographical location. So if the session you used in the US is suddenly being used somewhere in Europe the session would get terminated. This would have the downside of breaking sessions when using VPNs though. Also, if someone has landed malware on your computer sometimes they can use it as a proxy to access the website so geo tagging would not help you since the connection to YouTube would still be coming out of your PC. Although it would make exploitation harder which is essentially what security is all about.",

There's a [dedicated  server called **Lemmit**](https://lemmit.online/post/14692) that archives all kinds of content from Reddit to the Lemmyverse.\n\nThe upside of this is that there is no [single one person](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk45rr/) who is in charge and turn the entire platform to shit for the sake of a quick buck. And since it's a young platform, there's a stronger sense of togetherness and collaboration.\n\nSo yeah. So long Reddit. It's been great, until it wasn't.\n\n**When trying to post this with links, it gets censored by reddit. [So if you want to see those, check here](https://rentry.co/2kgcd)**.",

First you have the ads, then the authors autobiography and about how little Timmy and Sara's 5th cousin removed on their uncle Jimbo's side who once lived in the mountains of West Virginia battling goats and mountain lions with their Nana Martha who was from Italy but moved here to find love but ended up twirling in a pole just to make ends meet cause she had her siblings with her and had to learn how to cook from scratch cause groceries were too expensive and they made the amazing recipe she's posted. Then, there's the pictures with the step by step instructions, accidental pictures of John John's dirty bedroom and a Christmas party where Aunt Carmen showed up drunk and passed out on the toilet. Then the long list of what can and can't be substituted for those who suddenly have gluten allergies because a Google search of their symptoms says they are gluten free and possibly pregnant with a 3 eyed alien.¬† Gotta love Google MD. And then, you finally get to the recipe. Unless, of course, they have you first go through the endless comments and suggestions from people who can't actually cook and burn boiling water. It's like you just want the recipe, not a book or of the Encyclopedia Britainnca.",

Likely suits that are not even going to be in the company very long. They're in there to make some kind of quick impact and then move on to the next job for a bigger salary, so they just make a mess of things in the short term. \n\nThis reminds me when I used to design emails for a major automaker, and these people within the agency, account people, they had no idea about design, all they wanted to do was keep putting in more buttons for every little thing. They wanted this email to go to 10 different places. I've seen the same attitude from both client and agency where they try to make an email do the work of a web page. They want to put all this crazy amount of information and buttons and links and everything else and then they wonder why the engagement and conversion is low. \n\nAll of these pop-ups is somebody listing all of the things that are so highly important in their eyes, and they just figure it's better to keep barraging the user with all this stuff to get at least a little bit of conversion from it. I think most competent ux people would probably tell them to prioritize something and go from there. \n\nLike I would rather tell them to decide what is most important. Their email list, their social media links, or whatever service or special thing they are trying to sell. Pick one and push that. That, or we make one thing come up and put the pitch on there. Get on our emailing list and social media and here's this thing we are pushing. \n\nActually, I would probably do the additional product push if they decide to get on our mailing list or something like that. I'd also make it the front and center of the social media in case they happen to click one of those links. Find that engaged user and then pitch them that product. \n\nTo this day, all these kinds of companies can't understand why many of us are using ad blockers. We would just like to navigate the internet without 8,000 things coming up in front of us attempting to steal our attention away. \n\nI mean, I would love to one day see some real data on digital advertising, and see if there's any effectiveness in it. To basically point out that everybody is wasting their money and annoying everybody and they're not going to get anywhere. \n\nI still feel like if your online business is all about ad revenue, then you might as well close up and quit. The more you have to keep barraging people with advertising to try to make that money, the more you're just going to annoy people and eventually they're going to tell everyone else and no one's going to bother. Already certain websites and URLs I see and I don't bother clicking because I know what to expect. That's not good if people are remembering your brand in a bad way.",

Also some videos are good on youtube but ONLY if you search youtube specifically. If you just ask a question and select the video tab on top then that's another trap. Because you will THINK your clicking on a video but actually going to a website with maybe the video you saw imbedded in the page but you have to watch x,y,z video advertisements or sign up or give your email or who knows what. Meanwhile just go to youtube and cut out most of that other crap.",

But other people just don't. They either get lost or swindled.\n\nI hate the obfuscation, semantics thrown out the window, middle clicks and opening in new tabs being blocked, what should be a link is a button or a location.href, what shouldn't be a link... is. Hijacking history states. Unexpected, clickable crap appearing out of nowhere. Autocomplete suggestions changing or disappearing 5 milliseconds before you select them.\n\nI hate when they reinvent the wheel, when they put every single letter of a rich edit box in its separate DOM hierarchy with an entire gigantic tree structure, I hate when they can't just use normal input fields for normal, plain, basic stuff, instead choosing to go for the whatever \"framework native\" method.\n\nI hate how you can't search for specific problems AT ALL these days. If you have ANY issue that isn't the most common cookie cutter problem, then tough luck. Try searching for a problem with, for example, Chrome on your phone. You will only get answers for desktop. Or a problem with a specific car model from a specific year. Lucky if you'll even get a listicle with 10 tips for same brand of cars. **Web search is dead, beyond saving.** LLMs integrated into search only fueling the fire. I am currently having a problem with Windows 11, the taskbar sometimes gets behind maximized windows as if they were on fullscreen, it's NOT a problem with \"auto hide taskbar\", because I'm not even using that, I have to relaunch explorer.exe to fix it. But every search result points me towards that fucking option as if I'm the idiot. And that's all by design. Back in the day you actually were able to find people having the same problems as you. A couple years ago I was complaining how difficult it is to search for phrases with a negating word such as \"not\". Not using the \"-keyword\" with the minus. The preceding sentence serving as a self-referencing example. Oh how naive I was. How happy I was.\n\nI hate how the web is not even indexable, how forums have died and Discord became the king of online communities. How Discord is being used as a... fucking software distribution platform? Same with Patreon? What the fuck is even happening? Am I the insane one? Facebook actively fights indexing too, it's a wasteland.\n\nI hate when they say \"we care about your privacy\". Fuck off. That's the most condescending fake smile piece of bullshit a corporation could say.\n\nI hate enshittification and corporate greed in general. They got us all by the balls those 15 or so years ago when all of their services were oh-so-generously free and they were all operating at a loss, or rather, at a lack of substantial profit. Now they are reaping the benefits. We are the benefits. Every service is becoming worse, the quality is becoming worse, we are being sucked dry of our most intimate personal data, costs being cut left and right, good services becoming bad or discontinued, free services becoming paid, ads are being added to paid services, free services unusable because of ads. The early stages of this are happening to AI now. We are getting accustomed to free of charge AI services. OpenAI has got us by the balls right now already and they **will** reap the benefits of that sooner or later.\n\nI hate how if you are a commercial software developer who has not implemented a SaaS business model yet, you are basically throwing your money away. This reality sucks.\n\nBonus: I hate how e-mail sucks these days and how there is no good e-mail client or provider, free or not.",

The motivation was that it was a last chance to turn a bad UX moment to something positive. But before I pitched it I realized the signals it also sent out that the devs believe their 404/500 pages in the end would show up so often that part of their dev time must be spent on making them fun and apologetic.\nSo instead we tried to make a site that tries to show them as seldom as possible.\n\nBut the sites we are talking about here.. it almost feels like they are designed to crash so that they can squeeze in a page reload of new ads.",

You can get answers there, but the quality tends to be low and the site is not well maintained or moderated.\n\nI agree that google has been lacking severely when it comes to search engine quality results. They have not been able to try to improve their search results for years.

I want high quality results with spammy shit filtered out and no low quality newspapers or blog articles and way more options to refine and improve my results. Also google does not explain to newbie users at all how to effectively search - like using \"term\" to have the word term mandatory in search results or using a + between words to make sure both words are in the search results. It is crazy that a company that made their fortune via improving search (altervista was actually same quality but less marketed / pushed and abandoned after Yahoo! bought them) is so uninnovative when it comes to their core origin. Yahoo! also did not innovate at all, kept the cluttered directory style front page for years until people were fed up with it and collapsed. Google is much bigger but is on a down-slope when it comes to innovation as well.\n\nYoutube is a circle jerk and tool for absolute scam artists to promote stupidity, here you also need to use plugins to block stupid channels to keep from getting stupid, just by watching the thumbnails. I recommend BlockTube for that purpose.\n\nOverall I can concur - yes the web has become mainstream and that brings along more stupid people and content, but there is ways around it to filter out the bs.",

Firefox allows you to have different tab groups, I use it so personal is one and work/freelance is another. Then the Google accounts/tracking is tied to which one I want. Though it is annoying to be tracked none the less.\n\n- modal pop ups are the new carousel. It‚Äôs horrible design to try and illicit an action. When realistically it has the inverse effect.\n\n- blame GDPR on those banners.

You can get answers there, but the quality tends to be low and the site is not well maintained or moderated.\n\nI agree that google has been lacking severely when it comes to search engine quality results. They have not been able to try to improve their search results for years. As a company they are lackluster in innovation and their customer support is non-existing, except if you spend a lot of money in Adwords.\n\nI would like to see a serious challenger improving search results. I want high quality results with spammy shit filtered out and no low quality newspapers or blog articles and way more options to refine and improve my results. Also google does not explain to newbie users at all how to effictively search - like using \"term\" to have the word term mandatory in search results or using a + between words to make sure both words are in the search results. It is crazy that a company that made their fortune via improving search (altervista was actually same quality but less marketed / pushed and abandoned after Yahoo! bought them) is so uninnovative when it comes to their core origin. Yahoo! also did not innovate at all, kept the cluttered directory style front page for years until people were fed up with it and collapsed. Google is much bigger but is on a downslope when it comes to innovation as well.\n\nYoutube is a circle jerk and tool for absolute scam artists to promote stupidity, here you also need to use plugins to block stupid channels to keep from getting stupid, just by watching the thumbnails. I recommend BlockTube for that purpose.\n\nOverall I can concur - yes the web has become mainstream and that brings along more stupid people and content, but there is ways around it to filter out the bs.",

So I take a deep breath and close the modal\n\nThen there was one goddamn website that I visited very frequently that also had javascript to intercept the scroll. Infuriating. I can't remember which website it was though. Back when I used firefox I would have used Greasemonkey to try to solve that problem, but I haven't yet bothered to research how to automatically inject javascript in chromium based browsers.\n\nThanks for tips 2 and 3.",

You see, animations can often trigger these, leading to the onset of symptoms ranging from diziness and sickness, to the full on loss of ability to stand upright in extreme cases.\n\nOperating systems have an option to disable the OS animations, which many browsers tap into to set the `prefers-reduced-motion` property. CSS and JS can hook into this to prevent animations from running.\n\nHowever, an autoplaying video would not honor that setting, as videos in browsers currently don't look at that.\n\nI would advise using JS to prevent an autoplaying video if the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting is set to something like `reduce`.",

There will always be the ones who just don't care, and the ones with deep enough pockets to find ways around it.\n\nThere's only so much a browser vendor can do without breaking stuff. With cookies, it's impossible to say with 100% certainty that a cookie is used for tracking (names and domains can be changed at a whim), and many of the browser features used for tracking and fingerprinting have valid non-tracking uses. Like, a browser might block requests to hotjar tracking endpoint, but hotjar can just update the domain or claim that this is not tracking per se, but *justified gathering of anonymous usage data with a solid business reasoning backing it up,* and pursue it as a legal matter. Probably no-one wants to open that can of worms.\n\nSo apart from asking explicit permission for 3rd party cookies, the other alternative is what Apple Appstore is doing and 1) perform semi-manual approval of the app (website in this case) to ensure only the allowed types of tracking take place 2) present users with option to not be tracked (\"Ask app to not track\" on iOS). That obviously won't work with websites.",

You could even define defaults and automatically reject cookies that are tagged as non-necessary. Of course, still up to the site to be compliant.\n\nFor autoplay videos... Just... Don't do that.

A site that breaks because a browser blocks autoplay is inherently broken, it's not the browser breaking it, so that's 100% fine by me.\n\nRealistically:\n\n- Cookie popups should be replaced by web standards by which browsers can get user input about tracking consent in a standardized way. This way, a user can configure their browser to either reject anything outright without further explicit interactions, or give it *carte blanche* for allowing certain types of tracking, or make it show them a standardized UI on a per-case basis. After all, the decision is really always the same: given these categories of tracking information and purposes, which of these are you consenting to? Having a different UI for each site is detrimental to the user experience, often misleading, and unnecessarily disruptive.\n\nThere are browser plugins that approximate this behavior somewhat, by detecting common consent popups and automatically declining consent for you, but they only work for popups that follow a known pattern, which IME is about half of them. Introducing web standards to replace those custom popups, and making their use \"mandatory\" (if not by law, then through some kind of industry pressure, such as SEO punishment), could make this a complete non-issue, without going so far as to making tracking illegal entirely.",

But they'll take anything at that point so, again, it's not like it's logic-driven.\n\nOn the even rarer occasions that it would be technically possible to push for an alternative, 9 out of 10 frontend devs you get allocated meet you with blank stares when you mention not using React. Most of them aren't frontend devs, they're React devs. They don't know how any other framework works and are unwilling to learn.",

Or how in Chrome adding a SVG anywhere on a page with a specific filter will break backdrop filters across the entire page. Mainly just a lot of bugs with how rendering engines deal with the filters in general. You can work around all of them but it is a bit of a game of figuring out what actually functions cross browser as they all have different work arounds to get it to play nicely.

Nowadays browsers are equivalent to operating systems and frontend is a full development career and CORS causes a lot more damage than it offers. And the worst of it IMO is the amount of implementations that technically passes CORS (OPTIONS request return the right headers) but as soon as the real request goes and crashes (500 internal error) you get a CORS error that hides the fact that a 500 actually happened and it‚Äôs the backend code that‚Äôs broken, not the server configuration.\n\nWith that said, I would actually like to hear a compelling and thoughtful argument that refutes my conclusion",

So you clearly have a lot more experience under your belt and I respect my elders. \n\nTailwind is not perfect, but I completely believe the pros outweigh the cons. \n\nIn my humble opinion, tailwind utility classes aren‚Äôt cryptic at all. Once you memorise the name spaces for properties and unit increments. They are just as easy to understand and write as standard css properties. \n\nThey even require less characters to write too. `pr-12` vs `padding-right: 3rem`.. May not seem like a lot but this all adds up.\n\nWhat about media queries??\n\n`md:pr-22` \n\n\n\n\n```\n@media (min-width: 1024px) {\n  .your-class {\n    padding-right: 5.5rem;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\nNow this is an opinion I‚Äôm sure tailwind critics won‚Äôt agree with me on. But I think there‚Äôs something elegant about looking at your markup and seeing exactly what a wrapping div is doing for the layout inside. \n\n\n\n```\n<div class=‚Äúflex flex-row justify-center gap-x-2‚Äù>\n```\n\n\nThis is a pro of tailwind. You‚Äôre not having to jump between two files, and figure out what `.featured-content-card` is doing, and whatever other classes are being applied and possibly cascading and or overriding shit. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure what kind of projects you work-on/inherit.. But I believe it‚Äôs really suited to component/partial based frontends..\n\nYou‚Äôre totally right about the crazy 30 class names being repeated 10+ times. Markup like that should be placed in a component or partial to be used throughout your application. \n\nAlthough situations like this don‚Äôt make sense for very small or simple decorating styles. \n\n\n`.btn .btn-primary` \n\n\nWhich is why we have the @apply option you mentioned. Sure you can use plain css properties, but you lose the terse writing capability I mentioned before. \n\n\nWith 19 years of experience I have no doubt that you can write scalable CSS‚Ä¶ But im sure you‚Äôd agree with me that there‚Äôs some seriously awful CSS and even worse SCSS out there. I‚Äôve had some third party projects that have made me contemplate my job. CSS is something that we‚Äôve been trying to fix by creating preprocessors, css-in-js, naming conventions‚ÄîBEM.. and it‚Äôs all terrible. \n\nTailwind has problems, but those problems have little to do with tailwind itself and more to do with the problem it‚Äôs trying to solve (CSS). \n\n\nPeople still make jokes about how difficult it is to center a div. \n\nIf I could remove one thing from development forever it would be CSS. But what could replace it?",

Build a proper offset rule into the newer font specifications (alongside things like `font-size-adjust`).  While you're at it, do the same for `line-height`.  I never want to see a font property create an unexplainable margin between divs ever again.\n- Float clears: These have far too much dependence on the _next_ element to establish a layout.  Give us a native self-clearing float instead.\n- CSS-specific IDs: Every new CSS API now has its own ID system, like `grid-area` and `container-name`.  I'd much rather see better interop with HTML which already has IDs.\n- Specificity: That's right, toss out the whole cascade.  Yes, I understand how specificity is calculated.  It's still poor design.  Build atop `@layer` instead with an explicit keyword for propagation.\n- Web Components: These missed the mark, and most JS frameworks eschew using them.

We can also use the [Authorization header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization).\n\nIf we use a session cookie to implement the login session, then user is logged out when the browser closes. If we use a cookie with expiration timestamp, then the user is logged out when the time expires.\n\nWe can also implement a login session using a session ID cookie.

The reason given is always, \"I didn't think person A, B, or C deserved getting that grade.\"\n\nMy point being, hypothetically, even if we all agreed to do this, there would always be a significant portion of the population that would not think someone or some group \"deserves\" this kind of utopian experience. They would literally go out of their way to sabotage not only everyone else around them, but also go against their own best interests as well, just so those \"other undeserving people\" wouldn't have it.\n\nEDIT - Just reminded me of \"crabs in a bucket.\"",

        "author": "BornEze",
        "id": "1kpsut3",
        "selftext": "What's up guys. Been doing some research and cookies and how to secure them with my website I'm building, and I think I got a pretty good solution down pat. But I wanted some opinions on one specific element that's been bugging me...\n\n**TLDR - What if someone's auth cookie (remember me) that they get once successfully logged in, to access and interact with the website, is stolen.** Then the attacker can basically use that cookie to pose as User A to the server, and then do whatever malicious things they want with that account on my website.\n\nTrying to prevent that.\n\n\n\n**Essentially I have a log in system that works like this:**\n\n1. User logs in to the website with username/email and password\n2. Password provided is then hashed and compared against the hashed password thats stored in my database (hashed with a salt and pepper) - to confirm login combo\n3. If the password is successfully verified then the user is granted an `Auth Token` cookie from my website. The token is a random string thats 250 characters in length. Numbers, Letters, and Symbols - case sensitive. Its sent back and stored as a cookie. `setcookie(\"token\", \"Random String\", $CookieOptions);` \n4. That token is added to a Database - `Active_User_Sessions` with a current timestamp, last updated timestamp, and information about the user that just logged in: `IP Address, ISP, State, City, User Agent, Browser Name, Browser Version, List of Headers from the browser`. Along with their corresponding User ID.\n5. Then the user can browse the website successfully, managing their account, performing actions and what not.\n\n\n\nI have the cookies and headers set with these security settings on my site to help prevent sniffing, PHP:\n\n**On my config.php**\n\n    //Headers\n    header(\"Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'\");\n    header(\"Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload\");\n    \n    //set some secure paramters for user session\n    ini_set('session.use_only_cookies', 1);\n    ini_set('session.use_strict_mode', 1);\n    ini_set('session.cookie_httponly', 1);\n    \n    session_set_cookie_params([\n        'lifetime' => 0,\n        'domain' => 'mywebsite.net',\n        'path' => '/',\n        'secure' => true,\n        'httponly' => true,\n    ]);\n\n**Used every time I make and update a cookie:**\n\n    $CookieOptions = array (\n        'expires' => time()+(86400*30), //30 days \n        'path' => '/', \n        'domain' => 'mywebsite.net', \n        'secure' => true,    \n        'httponly' => true,    \n        'samesite' => 'Strict' \n    );\n\n  \nNow, anytime the user accesses any page once logged in, or performs any action on the website - their request is then checked using that `Auth Token` cookie that was stored when they first logged in, to make sure its a valid user thats logged in making the request. \n\n\n\n**Basically, here's how that works:**\n\n1. User browsers page or does something; like changes their profile picture or loads up their shopping list for example\n2. Request is sent with the `Auth Token` cookie\n3. `Auth Token` cookie is then searched for in that Database I mentioned earlier, - `Active_User_Sessions` . If that `Auth Token`  is returned, then we can see what User ID it corresponds to and we know that the request coming through is valid for an active user that logged in. (Otherwise if no results are found for the searched cookie then its not valid and the script will throw an error and prevent that request from going through.)\n4. The server then allows the request to continue on my script once validated - and then afterwards a new Random Value is generated for the token of that row in the `Active_User_Sessions` database. Its then updated, along with the last active timestamp, and the `Auth Token` cookie is also updated with this new value as well.\n5. User can continue on doing what they want, and after 30 days the `Auth Token` cookie they have on the browser will expire and ill have a cronjob clean out old session rows that are 30 days old or older as well in the `Active_User_Sessions` database\n6. Rinse and repeat. All good right? Not quite.\n\n\n\nNow my issue is if someone, **User B**, were to steal another users `Auth Token` cookie, **User A**, after they leave the site. Since they wouldn't be doing anything else, or taking any actions, that last `Auth Token` cookie would hold the same value until they visit the site again. Thus, giving **User B** time to use it for a fake authentication and then effectively kicking out **User A**'s valid session since its value would then change in the database.\n\nI've thought about how to prevent this by recording users certain data to make a footprint when they logged in, as mentioned earlier with the `IP Address, ISP, State, City, User Agent, Browser Name, Browser Version, List of Headers from the browser` begin stored.\n\nI could compare not only the `Auth Token` cookie, but this information coming in with the request to further be sure its the same person sending the cookie that originally logged in. \n\nHowever..., IP Addresses change, User Agents can be spoofed, and etc etc etc. So I ***KNOW*** its not a good way to do so - but its pretty much all I got to ensure that the same person who logged in is sending the legitimately. Pretty much the only reliable thing there would be the IP address. But if the user is switching between mobile network/wifi or has a dynamic IP there goes that. Also if someones cookie is sniffed then im sure the request headers will be sniffed too.\n\n  \nNow I've been doing research on how to prevent cookie sniffing, xss attacks, and all that - so I'm doing my best and obviously cant prevent this from happening if someone's actual device is stolen and being used, but I'm wanting to make things as secure as possible - just without being a hinderance to the user.\n\n  \nRecently saw these two posts here that I thought could help with this, a selector and validator:\n\n[Improved Persistent Login Cookie Best Practice | Barry Jaspan](https://web.archive.org/web/20180819014446/http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice)\n\n[Implementing Secure User Authentication in PHP Applications with Long-Term Persistence (Login with \"Remember Me\" Cookies) - Paragon Initiative Enterprises Blog](https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/04/secure-authentication-php-with-long-term-persistence)\n\nHowever, I'm still not 100% sure how that works or would benefit my situation specifically. I got confused reading it because if someone were to again, just steal the cookie - they would have valid data that the website would see as an authenticated user. Unless this method is just to prevent timing attacks or DOS attacks when the database is comparing strings? Read about that a little bit too, but thats something I dont know anything about so this whole idea confused me entirely.\n\n  \nFigured I'd post here and get some insight. Trying not to reinvent the wheel, but I haven't had much luck finding anything about this. Thanks. ",

But then I did some more search on this topic and just general security as a whole for website management regarding cookies and sessions. And I've come up a basically checklist/methodology that should give me the best security, but without being a hassle for end users.\n\nI specifically tried to keep in mind the scaling issue that you brought up, which makes sense - just hadn't thought of it.\n\nA lot of what I've been finding/reading points back to this article and to use cookies for a prolonged remember me feature. - [Implementing Secure User Authentication in PHP Applications with Long-Term Persistence (Login with \"Remember Me\" Cookies) - Paragon Initiative Enterprises Blog](https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/04/secure-authentication-php-with-long-term-persistence#title.2.1)\n\n# So here's what I've deduced:\n\n`Secure Cookies` \\- Make sure they're only sent over HTTPs so its encrypted and not in plain text\n\n`HTTPOnly`  \\- Prevent XSS - block scripts from reading the cookies\n\n`SameSite Strict` \\- Prevent other sites from sending requests with cookies, block malicious requests (CSRF attacks) and some other XSS attacks as well\n\n`Regenerate Session ID` \\- New session with a new id every x minutes and delete the old session, helps prevents session fixation so an attacker cant potential grab an active session\n\n`Timing Attacks and Preventing cookie leaking if database got breached` \\- Pair each Token with a Key or Verifier that's hashed in the database, but stored as plain text alongside the token data in the cookie - use the token as the selector for the current session the user is sending, then compare the hashed version of the key with what's stored in the database to validate the request. The hash comparisons stops timing attacks and the hashed key prevents an attacker from using any of the active sessions to impersonate any user *(though I don't know why i cant just store the hash of the token in both the database and the cookie and just do a search for it that way? Unless its because you shouldn't store the sensitive data like that and that would just bring it back to a timing attack issue and there would also be no need to hash in that case since im just doing a string to string comparison for the search, which again just goes back to beginning idea and -* ***ahhh ok, nvm now it finally \\*snaps fingers\\* clicks***\\*)\\*\n\n`Compare IP and Browser Name, Operating System, and OS Version`, at the minimum, with the requests when they come through with a valid cookie.\n\n\\>>>> If the cookie data matched **but the sending request country or state doesn't match**, flag/lock the account and clear all the active sessions for that user, notify user via email with a link to unlock their account - potential cookie theft just occurred, last resort of security of all else fails.\n\n`Every 5 minutes have the auth token get regenerated` on the next successful request from the user - this prevents any collisions from happening if on EVERY result I had kept it to change the token value like i did before - resulting in a user potentially blocking themselves should multiple tabs or requests be sent at the same time either through their own actions or background ajax requests. This, in theory, would cut down the chances of collisions like that happening a lot. While also keeping it secure like the sessions since the token would be changing every so often. The only downside, again, is if a user leaves the site before the next 5 minutes are up then the token stays the same until the next visit - leaving it vulnerable to a successful database return in the active sessions, if it somehow were to get stolen. But that's what the IP and other user info (state, country, browser, os, os version) comparisons would be for - to help stop that issue somewhat.\n\n`If user resets password` \\- clear all active sessions in the database\n\n`Users are required to have a minimum password length of 12 characters` \\- numbers, letters, symbols, no maximum character length (or maybe something like 1000 characters) - for added basic security\n\n`When users sign up, check the password they're about to use through a list of the most common passwords` and warn them that it was found in a data breach and either prevent them from using it, or warn them not to if the accept the risks.  Would just be a basic text file list comparison.\n\n`Limit user active sessions` to somewhere reasonable like 5 or 10.\n\nOf course nothing is **100% secure**,  (and again im probably just overthinking shit) but this I think is the best I can do that would at least provide a solid ground for security. I just like for things to be as secure as possible, with a balance of course...\n\nBut yea if a users device is stolen, infected with malware, or they connect to a shit public network and get exposed to a MTM attack, then I can't do shit about that. But I'll do my damnest on my end at least.",

                "body": "Usually in Web, the main worry is some third-party JS that can \"see\" what you put in localStorage and therefore exfiltrate things like JWTs kept there. \"httpOnly\" cookies are kept by the browser in a separate location that front-end JS has no access to, so they can't be stolen that way. Over the years we've seen so-called \"supply chain\" attacks where supposedly-trusted JS assets (see [https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/2024-polyfill-supply-chain-attack-what-to-know](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/2024-polyfill-supply-chain-attack-what-to-know) for an example) get compromised and attackers inject code that steals tokens/session IDs. So in Web the current best-practice is httpOnly cookies that can't be accessed by those scripts.\n\nToken theft concerns are not as big a priority in mobile apps (through this vector, anyway). With some exceptions, they're much more tightly controlled environments provided you're talking a real native app, not a PWA, and there is almost never any third-party JS involved. There is really no practical value in terms of security in trying to use cookies in a mobile app. They're not wrong or worse, but a native mobile app has full access to both cookies and standard headers (cookies are just another header, really) so using cookies doesn't add any value and it's kind of a clumsy format (semi-colon delimited key=value string). The only time we really do it is if we're connecting to an existing (typically legacy) backend that already provides that mechanism for Web, and offers no other option. The standard in mobile is an Authorization header, typically using Bearer-tokens.\n\nBut in mobile apps you **do** still need to be thoughtful about where you store these tokens / session IDs. Typically we use something like Keychain/Keystore to provide secure storage, and you can tell when an app is doing that when it also offers TouchID/FaceID because those services are what actually do that. The app itself doesn't actually read your fingerprint. When you store a value, you can mark it with flags that tell the OS biometric auth is required for retrieval, and the OS itself challenges the user for their biometrics. It's a very strong system.\n\nWith that setup usually we'll only store one value - the refresh token. We (I, anyway) don't store access/id tokens. Instead, when the app starts, a call gets made to see if there's a refresh token. If there is, a call is made to the backend with that to obtain a fresh access token for that session. The refresh token is then invalidated (and discarded from memory) and a fresh one is stored, and also discarded from memory. This process isn't really as critical these days, but it was an old school best practice to prevent token theft due to system-level compromises where attackers could read what's in RAM. It's one of those \"very very hard, but not actually **impossible**\" things so why not be careful? It's easy enough.",

You're not attacking me, you're just being ignorant. \n\nWhat I'm working on is effectively a location-specific corporate management platform. Users will almost effusively be working from computers within a specific building. The features being protected are eg creating new members for an org and modifying permissions. The system is effectively just a little more lenient/convenient than having to re-authenticate with every such action. If eg the IP address didn't match, the user simply has to re-authenticate and generate a new token. \n\nUsers riding on trains is not a concern. Users moving more than 100 ft probably won't happen. And if something does invalidate the token, all they have to do is re-authenticate. Not really so different from how secure/sensitive operations are handled everywhere.\n\nMatching IP address is only used for the select requests that demand high security. If I could figure out how to revoke such turns when their screen locks, I would. \n\nAnd, though I never even implied I thought it to be a silver bullet, it is still enhanced security and another layer of security. The point is that, even if all else fails, for the most critical things these tokens still cannot really feasibly be used if somehow stolen. \n\nAnd yes, there are still ways of stealing such cookies, even without a device being fully compromised. Various attacks have been executed that just require opening a crafted PDF attachment, for example. I don't quite know how that works because I don't really do much with PDF, but that was a common attack within the last year, I believe. The point of the IP address verification is just to protect against any future mistakes, or even certain forms of social engineering.\n\nI made an informed decision, knowing the full context, and being fully aware of exactly what the check does and doesn't protect against. It's pretty damn good at ensuring the request originated from the device + browser the token was created for, which is really good at protection in the event of cookie theft. That protection is pretty much gone once a user is using something like a public VPN or if they have bad security practices or whatever. But that puts the risk into a different area of concern for overall security. \n\nAnd I was just giving an example of how some cookie (here a JWT) being invalid isn't necessarily anything malicious. Maybe the user just disconnected from a corporate VPN or something. My point here is indisputably just valid. And who do you think you are to butt in and criticize my security practices when you know nothing of the requirements or context?",

Those issues would break so many other things that hardware and software (e.g. browser) developers go to Great lengths to prevent them now. We have ECC memory, error checking in TCP, SSL validation on https calls would fail to decrypt, etc. As an application developer, you really shouldn't have to code around those types of expectations for cookies. Abuse is definitely a possibility, but suppose you have another developer on your project that simply implement them wrong? My advice would be to design your app in such a way that it doesn't matter. They are simply present or not, valid or not. The script kitties and hackbots will take a poke at you in a hundred ways beyond just this. If you actually watch a live tale of an access log on a production website, you'd be shocked at the nonsense that goes on. As long as it's not a DDoS or other more orchestrated attack, it's just a nuisance. I wouldn't spend much time on it.\n\nI'm a big believer in being clear about the difference between practical and theoretical security. Lots of people like to talk about the latter and often mist details in the former. For instance, as another commenter or two mentioned, you are almost certainly not validating your cookies. Cookies are not signed and do not include mechanisms for validation. They are simply strings. You are almost certainly putting jwts in your cookies, in which case, good on you because that's a modern best practice as opposed to transmitting them other ways (assuming you're setting appropriate httpOnly/etc flags). But if you're going down that route, I would spend an hour looking at OWASP and other guidelines regarding JWT handling. Most major security vendors have fairly well written blog posts that you can Google. You will find recommendations in there on things like always explicitly setting your algorithms for both signing and validation. Those are the items I would personally be spending my time on.",

Why that/those term(s)? Please offer multiple terms if you have lots of ideas!\n\n(The main constraint/goal for the term is to balance describing its technical purpose and its memorableness/catchiness. On the aforementioned spectrum, *HTTP cookie* is arguably too far down the catchy end of the spectrum, so looking for something that tells its technical purpose more. Arguments for cookies intuitiveness are welcome as well.)\n\n**My (Biased) Favorites**: *the reason why*\n\n* **HTTP Passport**: *because it captures both the authentication (identification) and tracking purposes of modern cookies while being easy to remember.*\n* **HTTP Ticket Wallets**: *because of* [*the explanation*](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/s1vnxz/comment/hsbzele/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nEdit: included my favorite(s) & made an ask for a reason for your proposed term(s)\n\nEdit 2: another biased fav",

        "selftext": "Context:\n\nI'm working on a .Net 8 Web API and I'm having some issues with cookies. I'm using SAML for SSO login/logout, which then gives a cookie to the user on a successful login from the IDP. My current implementation, I have users redirected on access to the website via a 401 response received from my back end that my Vue.js frontend handles when trying to access the site without an auth cookie. The redirect goes to the login of the IDP, this is done by routing to the API login call (i.e call to APIURL.com/api/login) from the frontend. I currently have sliding expiration set so that the max age is about an hour. This was working before trying to extend authorization by adding in an absolute expiration on top of the sliding expiration, so that a user would get logged out regardless after say 12 hours. I was trying to follow this blog post: [https://brokul.dev/authentication-cookie-lifetime-and-sliding-expiration](https://brokul.dev/authentication-cookie-lifetime-and-sliding-expiration) \n\n  \nWhen trying to implement the custom cookie events from the blog, the API no longer sends back a response on failure to authenticate, so the frontend redirect isn't triggering to go to the IDP login page. In my app log, I'm getting:\n\n    Authorization failed. These requirements were not met:\n    DenyAnonymousAuthorizationRequirement: Requires an authenticated user.\n\nI understand that this is due to the addition of the custom cookie events. Thus, no response is sent from the API backend to the frontend. From what I have read, I can't use ExpiresUTC on login because it would overwrite the SlidingExpiriation. From some other blog posts, it seems like with [Asp.Net](http://Asp.Net), I can only use 1 or the other, which is why I'm trying to implement the custom cookie events to check for an absolute time.\n\n  \nFrom my intuition, there is probably a better way to handle login redirects on authorization failure, but I couldn't quite find good examples online.\n\nTl;Dr Questions:\n\n(Short-Term) How do I get it so that on authorization failure, the API would send a 401 response with the custom cookie event?\n\n(Long-Term) What is an example a best practice implementation on dealing with redirects on authorization failure with cookies?",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nBeginner web developer and i'm going crazy, i hope this is correct place to ask.... Basically i'm making Spring Boot - Angular app, where on login endpoint i create a cookie with token and sending it back to frontend and browser if login succeeds. This all worked locally so far, no issue whatsoever.\n\nBut now, i'm trying to host this website through my friend's server (using cloudflare), using docker-compose which includes frontend, backend and mariadb database. While i had some issues with cors at first, it eventually got resolved, but now i reached the point where two weird things are happening:\n\n   * Http-cookie is not received. I put some logs around, no issue happening on token creation and cookie creation, no errors anywhere... but browser never gets the cookie and i can't figure out why.\n   * For some reason, logging in or any login attempt, successful or not only works once, afterwards i'm always getting Unauthorized error until i clear browser cache.\n\nBoth these problems only happen on my prod docker builds and i can't figure out what the problem is. I'll share some relevant code, feel free to ask for more code if needed, pls note that i'm not the most efficient coder yet so my code might not follow best practices atm (but any tips are welcome as i'm doing my best to improve)\n\nThis is angular's http call. Personally i don't think problem is in this, but maybe there is something i'm missing.\n\n[angular http call](https://preview.redd.it/hdcv48sbbfxe1.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd4bcb0af875c7fce92d8f9dfd8b331a15804096)\n\nNow for the backend. This is /login endpoint. This setup worked completely fine in local environment. It might be something with jwtCookie having something that is not accepted in https environment? But i tried changing setSecure and httpOnly to false, without success.\n\n[\\/login endpoint logic](https://preview.redd.it/0g1gcn4abfxe1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=e90486e50037c2845f13770f8a6ceaa05f1f144b)\n\nauthenticate function in service basically checks if user exists and then generates a token which is then saved into LoginResponseDTO and returned. We also tried some settings in cloudflare, as i read disabling caching on certain urls could help, but again, no success.\n\nAny suggestions pls? what am i missing :( I can send more code snippets or maybe even open github link if it would help identify what's wrong.\n\nThanks in advance",

That's what the TCF 2.0 is. Advertising consents are stored in a standardised format that the entire online advertising industry conforms to.\n\nBut we're not allowed cross-domain cookies any more, for stupid reasons.\n\nSo now each site has to set its own, and even multiple sites owned by the same network can't\\* share consent info.\n\n> so browsers can automatically set a cookie policy globally\n\n*Yes*, we *should* have this, instead of having to load the many hundreds of kilobytes of \"consent platform\" JS & associated assets on every pageview. Now that we do have, however, an industry built up of *paid-for* consent management JS bullshit, I very much doubt we'll be seeing the back of that any time soon, if ever. There's now a vested interest in keeping this horrific bullshit around.\n\nAs far as the titular assertion goes:\n\n> Cookie Consent leads to more tracking via cookies\n\nI don't believe this is the case. We only see opt-ins on our CMPs of 60-85%, and there's no way in hell 15-40% of visitors were ever clearing cookies manually with any frequency prior to all this crap.\n\n\\*Well, you *can*, depending on whether your CMP offers such a facility. The only (as far as I'm aware) decent free one left standing is QuantCast's, and they *do* allow cross-domain cookie preference setting, but I believe it's via passing data around their backend servers or some bollocks or other; too much hassle to properly investigate.",

I tended to use these a lot but am using them less and less because I am sick of popups or some wall on every request I make. But I can only speak for myself of course!

I'll try to explain my idea.\nIf you make a cross-origin request this is normally blocked by the browser (you either can't read the response or not make it at all). This is good behavior as it prevent CSRF.\nBut this can only happen if the browser decided to make Cross-Origin request retain set cookies from the Origin.\n\nFor example if I set SESSION_TOKEN when logging to bank.com future request to bank.com will include it and therefore making such a request but from a separate website could trigger a forged authenticated request.\nSOP prevents it but IMO it could be even better. Instead of preventing requests completely why not just allowing them but without any set cookies and other stuff and therefore no SESSION_TOKEN. This would be similar to making the request from something like curl and while not as powerful it would be very useful for unauthenticated / self-authenticated API endpoints ",

But blocking the entire request prevent different variations of a cross-site request attack rather than strictly the ones requiring authentication. \n\nFor example, lots of self-hosted services aren't set up to require authentication. [evil.com](http://evil.com) could craft some malicious request to [http://localhost:5000/admin/dosomethingnasty](http://localhost:5000/admin/dosomethingnasty) for example.\n\nOr [evil.com](http://evil.com) could use visitors' browsers to DDOS some public API.\n\nThe point is that blocking requests blocks pretty much 100% of the problem, while blocking cookies just stops a subset of that",

To take advantage of the rich XML content available on the Web, application developers must resort to proxying the content through the domain hosting their application thereby increasing overhead and limiting scalability.\n\n\nThis note describes a mechanism being used in the industry that allows a content provider to use a processing instruction embedded within the XML content to specify the access policy of that content. In this model a user agent can safely extend the sandbox in which it has restricted the application to include access to the XML content if and only if the specified policy grants permission.\"",

Pretty much everybody else here doesn‚Äôt know the first thing about CORS and badly misunderstands it.\n\nCORS does not prevent cross-origin requests. It *enables* cross-origin requests. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called Cross-Origin Resource *Sharing* and not Cross-Origin Resource *Blocking*. It does *literally the opposite* of what everybody here is saying.\n\n*By default*, browsers do not allow most types of cross-origin requests. The thing that stops this is the Same-Origin Policy, which has been in web browsers since the mid-90s. This is what protects users. This is *not* CORS.\n\nSince cross-origin requests are very useful, about *fifteen years after* the Single-Origin Policy was introduced, CORS was created to selectively *disable* this security measure. CORS *removes* a security barrier, it does not *add* a security barrier.\n\nUnderstanding this is very important. Half the reason so many people get confused by it is that they hear CORS adds this security barrier and so when they run into problems making cross-origin requests, they think their problem is caused by CORS and the solution is to *disable* it, when their problem is caused by the SOP and CORS is the *solution* to their problem that they need to *enable*.\n\nIf a project you are working on goes through a pen test and you hear that you need to disable CORS, that does not mean that the security barrier is unnecessary and you can open up access, it means the opposite ‚Äì your security is too open and you need to close things down.",

They are both a feature of the transmission, and as that feature they perform the same task, but they are not the same feature as each other as they each perform that task slightly differently, and they were developed separately.\n\nIf when gearshifters were first being developed, someone made a single gearshifter that could be automatic or manual at the same time by the user's choice, then that would have been developed as one single feature, although one might say that the \"auto-manual\" gearbox has two features - automatic for the cruises and manual for the races.",

Tracking this connection between the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address of a user would be considered personal identifyable information.\n\nAnother issue is that a users IP address can change as they are interacting with your website. What if they open your website while on a public hotspot, then move to mobile data as they lost connection. You now have an IP address inside your Google Tag Manager that is not found in your cookie consent logs.\n\nThis shows that IP addresses are not great identifiers for this\n\nYou need a token that identifies the user in both Google Tag Manager and your consent logs, while still preserving privacy",

        "author": "trolleid",
        "id": "1kndkjh",
        "selftext": "This is a _super brief_ explanation of them which can serve as a quick-remembering-guide for example. I also mention some connected topics to keep in mind without going into detail and there's a short code snippet. Maybe helpful for someone :-) The repo is: https://github.com/LukasNiessen/http-authentication-explained\n\n# HTTP Authentication: Simplest Overview\n\nBasically there are 3 types: Basic Authentication, Bearer Authentication and Cookie Authentication.\n\n## Basic Authentication\n\nThe simplest and oldest type - but it's insecure. So do not use it, just know about it.\n\nIt's been in HTTP since version 1 and simply includes the credentials in the request:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>\n```\n\nAs you see, we set the HTTP header _Authorization_ to the string `username:password`, encode it with base64 and prefix `Basic`. The server then decodes the value, that is, remove `Basic` and decode base64, and then checks if the credentials are correct. **That's all**.\n\nThis is obviously insecure, even with HTTPS. If an attacker manages to 'crack' just one request, you're done.\n\nStill, we need HTTPS when using Basic Authentication (eg. to protect against eaves dropping attacks). Small note: Basic Auth is also vulnerable to CSRF since the browser caches the credentials and sends them along subsequent requests automatically.\n\n## Bearer Authentication\n\nBearer authentication relies on security tokens, often called bearer tokens. The idea behind the naming: the one bearing this token is allowed access.\n\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n\nHere we set the HTTP header _Authorization_ to the token and prefix it with `Bearer`.\n\nThe token usually is either a JWT (JSON Web Token) or a session token. Both have advantages and disadvantages - I wrote a separate article about this.\n\nEither way, if an attacker 'cracks' a request, he just has the token. While that is bad, usually the token expires after a while, rendering is useless. And, normally, tokens can be revoked if we figure out there was an attack.\n\nWe need HTTPS with Bearer Authentication (eg. to protect against eaves dropping attacks).\n\n## Cookie Authentication\n\nWith cookie authentication we leverage cookies to authenticate the client. Upon successful login, the server responds with a Set-Cookie header containing a cookie name, value, and metadata like expiry time. For example:\n\n```\nSet-Cookie: JSESSIONID=abcde12345; Path=/\n```\n\nThen the client must include this cookie in subsequent requests via the _Cookie_ HTTP header:\n\n```\nCookie: JSESSIONID=abcde12345\n```\n\nThe cookie usually is a token, again, usually a JWT or a session token.\n\nWe need to use HTTPS here.\n\n## Which one to use?\n\nNot Basic Authentication! üòÑ So the question is: Bearer Auth or Cookie Auth?\n\nThey both have advantages and disadvantages. This is a topic for a separate article but I will quickly mention that bearer auth must be protected against XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and Cookie Auth must be protected against CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery). You usually want to set your sensitive cookies to be Http Only. But again, this is a topic for another article.\n\n## Example of Basic Auth in Java\n\n```Java\nimport java.net.HttpURLConnection;\nimport java.net.URL;\nimport java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;\nimport java.util.Base64;\n\npublic class BasicAuthClient {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            String username = \"demo\";\n            String password = \"p@55w0rd\";\n            String credentials = username + \":\" + password;\n            String encodedCredentials = Base64.getEncoder()\n                .encodeToString(credentials.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));\n\n            URL url = new URL(\"https://api.example.com/protected\");\n            HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n            conn.setRequestMethod(\"GET\");\n            conn.setRequestProperty(\"Authorization\", \"Basic \" + encodedCredentials);\n\n            int responseCode = conn.getResponseCode();\n            System.out.println(\"Response Code: \" + responseCode);\n\n            if (responseCode == 200) {\n                System.out.println(\"Success!

Depending on the browser, there are two different behaviors. Of course, you cannot directly change the value of such a cookie. And you cannot delete it either. But, but, but. You can always write another cookie with the same name, but using a different path.  \nExample.  \nYou have an http Only cookie of this type:\n\nSet-Cookie: foo = bar ; HttpOnly; Path=/\n\nAnd you can absolutely legally write something like this in your js\n\ndocument.cookie = \"foo =what ; path=/somepath ;\"\n\nLet's move on.  \nIf you make a request to the server at /somepath , then depending on the browser the following will happen.  \nFirefox and Safari will transfer both cookies.\n\nCookie: foo=bar ; foo=what ;\n\nChrome will transfer only the httponly cookie.

Performance: Reading and writing data from the session/cookie is generally faster than a database operation.\n2. Simplicity: Easier to implement, doesn't require extra database management or setup.\n3. Server Resources: Lessens the load on your server, as it doesn't require server-side database interaction.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Size Limitations: Cookies particularly have storage limits. For large carts, this could be problematic.\n2. Persistence: If a user clears their cookies or changes the device/browser, the cart data will be lost.\n3. Security: Session data can be vulnerable if not handled properly. Also, cookies can be disabled by the user, which would break this functionality.\n\nStoring in a database:\n\nPros: \n\n1. Persistence: Cart data will be available across different devices and browsers. This is particularly useful if you have an authentication system and want to provide a seamless experience for logged-in users. \n2. Scalability: Databases are designed to handle large amounts of data, so you won't have issues with cart size. \n3. Advanced Features: Storing in a database allows for more complex features, such as storing cart history, analyzing user purchase behavior, etc.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Performance: Database operations can be slower than reading from session/cookie, and it may increase server load.\n2. Complexity: It requires more development work to design, implement, and manage a database solution.\n3. Cost: Depending on your infrastructure, maintaining a database might add to the costs.\n\nSo, which approach should you choose?\n\nIf you're building a simple e-commerce platform, and you don't expect users to build up large carts, then storing cart data in the session or cookies may be sufficient.\n\nHowever, if you're looking to provide a more advanced and seamless user experience across different devices/browsers, or if you anticipate users will have large carts, then a database solution would be better. It also opens up opportunities for more advanced features and analytics down the line.\n\nAlso, it's worth considering a hybrid approach, where you store cart data in both the session/cookie and the database. The session/cookie can provide a quick and responsive user experience, while the database ensures persistence and scalability. You could use the session/cookie as the primary storage and sync it to the database at regular intervals or at specific triggers (like at login/logout, or when the cart changes significantly).\"",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone! I‚Äôll pay for help.\n\nI‚Äôm in a bind. I started at a startup a couple months ago as a demand gen marketer and found that the website cookie banner wasn‚Äôt recording data so pivoted to Hubspot‚Äôs CMP. Our agency got those banners on the site but the consent tracking in GTM is a mess. \n\nI‚Äôve been implementing Consent Mode using GTM in conjunction with HubSpot‚Äôs cookie banner. Most of the integration seems to work except for one major issue that I haven‚Äôt been able to resolve:\n\nProblem:\nConsent values are getting overwritten when a user accepts cookies‚Äîeven though U.S. visitors should default to ‚Äúgranted.‚Äù Instead, the values are either not being set correctly at page load, or they‚Äôre being overwritten after a user clicks ‚ÄúAccept.‚Äù As a result, GA4 tags are firing inconsistently, and Consent Mode isn‚Äôt behaving as expected.\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far:\n\n \nSet up HubSpot CMP using their native cookie banner with separate categories for marketing, analytics, functional, etc.\nConfigured GTM with a Consent Initialization Tag to run before any other tags:\njavascript\nCopyEdit\ngtag('consent', 'default', { 'ad_storage': 'denied', 'analytics_storage': 'denied', 'functionality_storage': 'denied', 'personalization_storage': 'denied', 'security_storage': 'granted' });\nEnabled ‚ÄúRespond to Global Privacy Control‚Äù in the HubSpot banner settings to respect user browser signals.\nTested behavior in GTM Preview Mode and confirmed:\nConsent values are initially set correctly when the page loads.\nBut once a user interacts with the banner and accepts cookies, the values are being overwritten instead of updated according to category selection.\nThis happens even when no GTM tags are firing at the moment of consent.\nChecked for firing tags and no conflicting tags or triggers seem to be running when the overwrite occurs.\nConfirmed U.S. visitors should be opted in by default, per agency recommendation‚Äîbut this doesn‚Äôt appear to be happening. The defaults are still being treated as denied.\n\nQuestions:\nHas anyone else seen HubSpot CMP override Consent Mode values after interaction?\nHow can I stop consent states from being overwritten when a user accepts?\nIs there a recommended way to intercept or preserve the values during/after banner interaction?\nCould this be a sequencing issue between HubSpot and GTM tags?\n\nAny help would be hugely appreciated‚Äîthank you in advance!

        "selftext": "I would like to improve UX for authentication in my pet web app.\n\nJust to clarify about the title: I'm talking about storing session DATA, not session token. You CAN NOT use session data to authenticate your requests - requests are authenticated with a session token which is stored an http-only cookie. Session data is basically your userid, username, email and when your session expires. Right now it's just stored in-memory on the client.\n\nIs it okay to store such data in a cookie accessible in JS? That way I could: 1) redirect unauthorized users to signin page immediately by checking in my middleware that they dont have session data / it expired. 2) Authorized users will get page rendered faster since session data is already in the cookie - no need for another server roundtrip.\n\nThere is no security concern for impersonation or anything like that - if someone tries to set session data cookie manually, well then, all their API requests will be either unauthorized or at least authenticated with their actual data, not impersonated one.\n\nSo basically honest users will get a faster, more responsive experience and malicious actors won't be able to get access to any data they're not supposed to.\n\nSo the only concern I have - perhaps it's not ok to store user's email in a cookie accessible to JS, for example, that way chrome extension can get access to it. It's not a huge security concern but some people may not like that their email is in the open.\n\nSo is that okay or not?\n\nA step-by-step explanation if that makes it more clear.\n\nCurrently:\n\n1. Make a request for the page\n\n2. Server sends back HTML response\n\n3. Client renders pages, then makes a request to the server to get session data\n\n4. Client gets response with session data, stores in memory, uses it to render profile page\n\nWhat I would like to do:\n\n1. Make a request for the page\n\n2.

It's been becoming an issue over time for me but I don't want to turn 'ranty' as I think most of you will share the frustration. I finally broke today because I I was browsing on my phone, then on my PC, and I've had enough. \n\nMore so because I've noticed a lot of the websites I've visited use the same consent platform, like OneTrust so I thought if I've rejected for one site using this consent platform why isn't there a way for OneTrust to remember my choice for all websites?\n\nFrom a users' perspective, do you know if there's a way to bypass, automatically dismiss or choose an option on cookie consent banners across multiple websites in a browsing session? \n\nFor context, I mostly use Chrome, Firefox and a mix of Windows, iOS & MacOS. I can handle my choice not being remembered across platforms, i.e. from mobile to desktop to laptop. But on one platform using the same browser, it'd be great if there was a way where I just wasn't prompted on every single website I visit when I'm researching something in a browser session.\n\nI've searched r/webdev and while there's a few things generally about cookie consent and people's opinions, I couldn't find anyone raising this point about the platforms themselves remembering the user's preference. The closest thing I've seen would be a browser setting but alas this isn't currently available on Chrome and Firefox to my knowledge.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Cookies are just a very tiny part of all that (only mentioned 3 times in the specs), but it became the bogeyman for the industry to focus on. The main issue in general is tracking. If this is done without using cookies, it still absolutely falls under the GDPR.\n\nAlso, these banners and modals look like they've been built either by AI or the most imcompetent developer that walked the planet. Some of the first iterations of these I saw would actually make dozens of external API calls to register you opting out (contrary to the very specific opt in behaviour the GDPR calls for) of specific groups of cookies. Those modals would take literal minutes to \"process\" your request, and most people would either leave the site or just accept everything (which conveniently was instant).\n\nThe state of play currently is a mess of unusable cookie modals, some of which require hundreds of individual clicks to fully opt out of everything (and yes, [I tested some sites and counted](https://www.ashleysheridan.co.uk/blog/Accessibility+Issues+With+Cookie+Banners) ). The result is something that is difficult for most people to use, and impossible for those people with specific accessibility needs. And a mistake I see pretty much every banner/modal make is to list the essential/functional cookies but as a readonly option that can't be changed. They're not part of tracking, they never needed to be listed or disabled, but somehow, they fell into the general misconception that GDPR = no cookies.\n\nAs the GDPR works through the various companies that violate specific sections of it, I reckon we'll see another change in how these modals are presented, but that's probably on a timescale of years.",

This can cause session cookies to last indefinitely.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd as has been posted here and on StackOverflow before if a client has their browser set to \"continue where you left off\", the client can close the window, and reopen without the browser deleting the http cookie.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIs this is legitimate concern? I presume that if the client closes the TAB with my website on it, then closes their browser, that would be a qualifying event for the browser to delete the cookie? What about if the user closes the tab but doesn't close the browser? Is there an elapsed time after which the browser chooses to delete the cookie?\n\nI do realize that none of this matters when it comes to adversarial users... im simply looking for peace of mind that under normal situations (and popular browsers), session expiring cookies dont last forever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, I am aware that the title is a bit of a mouthful, but Im trying to SEO it so that other users wont need to ask the same question.",

If you track the user, then it doesn't matter whether you use cookies or browser fingerprinting or URL query strings or tracking pixels or whatever, you have to get explicit consent (or be able to argue some other legal basis, e.g., local laws might require you to do it). If you don't track the user nor do anything else that falls under GDPR, then you don't need consent or any other legal basis.

                "body": "Ah yes, GDPR making the internet less fun for all of us =)\n\nYou mentioning Google Analytics complicates matters slightly, but since your question also covers cookie consent in general I'll first tackle the general bits and address GA at the end.\n\nWhat you need to do is to actually prevent any type of cookie being set *before* the user has consented to allow them. Keep an eye on the *Cookies* section of the *Application* tab (when using Chrome's inspector panel), you'll be amazed how many third party cookies are set just from including scripts (or ifames, looking at you *youtube-nocookie* !).\n\nYou need to the following:\n\n**First:**\n\ndefer loading Analytics and any other third party script that might set cookies until consent is given. You need to do this client side using JS. So with pseudo code:\n\n**1** IF (on page load) / WHEN at runtime) cookie is set  \n**2** THEN load 3rd party scripts  \n**3** ELSE show consent popup\n\n**1** You can set an actual cookie (which you can read through *document.cookie* which brings the benefit that this cookie is also accessible to your backend, if you need this). ~~Otherwise you can just store a value inside local storage.~~ *< not true, see comment below*\n\n**2** This is where you create script elements and attach them do your *document.head.*\n\n**3** Show a modal window that you can make as obtrusive and unobtrusive as you like\n\nThis is where I can answer whether you want to use a 3rd party cookie banner or not:\n\n*It depends* : on what you want want the user experience to be like. If you deem the site unusable unless a user provides consent, this modal must be blocking the user from seeing content (at this point you need backend to only serve content to the browser when the user has accepted the cookie as users can otherwise circumvent any client side blocking you can think of).\n\nIf you want users to browse the site with reduced content, allow selecting which cookies they are willing to accept, or be a nice person and add a button allowing them to dismiss all cookies entirely. At this point you can store in session storage (which is not a persistent cookie) that the user does not want to be bothered with consent popups for the remainder of the session (e.g. until they close the browser).\n\nDon't reinvent the wheel when there is a ready to use solution, but be aware that in one form or another this solution needs to integrate with the requirements of your site.\n\nRolling your own solution might seem cumbersome but providing you have a clear idea of how to implement it, it might not be a hassle, for instance for my personal website I use Analytics and embed media content from YouTube. I allow users to view the site without consent which shows everything but shows placeholder content where the YT embed would be. If they click the placeholder I once more show the consent modal. Upon consent all third party content is embedded. The mechanism for this are just a few lines of JS to defer loading scripts. If you have this mechanism before creating the content views of your site, it's not really hard to maintain. Doing it retroactively... well that's a different story.\n\n**Secondly:**\n\nPer regulation, you need to list the cookies and what they are used for. Nobody reads this, but you need to have this section covered by law. You can create a link to a page from the consent popup and there you can list what every cookie is and what it is used for in a ginormous table. You can steal this text from any other site (because get this, they will be using it for the same purpose) or heck, ask Chat GPT to come up with something. :)\n\n**Third:**\n\nThe EU really, really doesn't like it when PII (personally identifiable information) is stored outside of EU data centers. Google Analytics stores its data in the US. You must set the *anonymize\\_ip* flag when configuring gtag (as an IP address is considered PII). <- *Sweden, Norway and a few other countries consider this still a breach though*\n\nAlso Google fonts. Download them and host them on your site (this is legal and you can download the fonts from Google fonts directly). Because loading the font from the Google CDN ... *stores PII in the US.* So once more: really, really check that inspector panel to understand what cookies are set just from visiting the pages of your site.",

(oh and it's all within family so if I screw up there's really no legal consequences which means it is alright that I might not be qualified for the job :D)  \n\n\nI've been reading about cookies because dad had a concern about the infamous cookie banner. The website (as of now) does not collect a single cookie and I confirmed that with dev tools and also few cookie scanners. So we implemented a simple toast informing that we do not collect any cookies, and yes it shows up every time somebody reenters or refreshes the website.  \n\n\nNow for my question. Wiki says \\`Cookies are placed on the device used to access a website,\\`  \nMDN says that a cookie is something that server sends to the user. And I am really thinking here because:  \n\n\nI was thinking about implementing a simple analytics system (no need for advanced google shit) that would work on every button. Every button has an ID, and when it's clicked, I get a +1 in my database. Fully anonymous, no IPs, no locations, just a simple number increment. It might also count seconds to see which photos are being displayed.. I think you get the point. A primitive analytics that would help me figure out how to position things on the website, what's interesting and what isn't.  \n\n\nThere would be no tracking, no permanently keeping anything on user's PCs, no PII at all. Would something like this be considered a cookie? Would it need a legit cookie banner? Is it a fair solution?Am I thinking about it in a wrong way or doing something wrong?   \n\n\nAbove are few questions that come to my mind when trying to grasp this topic.

If you do not collect any user data and don't save any cookies you don't have anything to inform about, so just don't.\n\nAs for the rest of your question, any kind of tracking is still tracking and in general the user should be informed about that and allowed to opt-out.

It's not a pattern I've personally come across before, but I think it's a better UX that is more respectful of our users.\n\n**We only request cookie consent at the point the user tried to do something that requires them.**\n\nOur approach is:\n\n* Don't set any cookies, and don't ask to either. No cookie/GDPR banner required.\n* Show the user features that would require cookies, anyway.\n* If the user attempts to interact with one of those features, *that's when* we ask for the cookies we need.\n* The consent dialog highlights the type of cookie required for the feature they tried to use, but also presents the other cookie options too. The user is here now, we can give them the option to enable/disable whichever cookies they want.\n* No dark patterns in the consent dialog. Two clear buttons, Allow or Cancel, neither is more prominent than the other.\n* If the user cancels, the feature they tried to use doesn't execute/doesn't do anything. If they grant the correct cookies, whatever they were trying to do goes ahead.\n* Having granted cookies, we now don't need to ask again. The user can now use that feature uninterrupted in the future. They'll see a new modal asking for more permissions if they try to use a feature that requires another class of consent.\n\n(Obviously, this doesn't help if you want cookies all the time, because you want to track users all the time. We use privacy-respecting, cookie-less analytics instead, and enhance this with additional cookie-dependent metrics if the user grants analytics cookies.)\n\nWhat do you think of the approach? Have you seen anything like this anywhere before?",

So I have a few questions:\n\n1. Does this only apply to Meta Pixel or will I have to set it up this way for Google Analytics too?\n2. Doesn‚Äôt doing this skew your analytics especially when running FB Ads?\n3. Since this regulation is EU-specific, is there a way to set it up so that this only happens with EU-based IPs? Do I even need to or am I just overthinking this?",

You'll also need to implement google consent mode V2 if you are using Google Analytics or other google services (such as Google ads)\n\n\n2) Yep, it's really annoying. Since we implemented the cookie popup on our sites we have a consent rate of around 80% that roughly explains the 20% visitor drop in our analytics.\n\n\n3) You could set it up only for EU. Many CMP offer this possibility. You might want to read about the CCPA if you have some visitors from California or some states such as Virginia. Those states don't require a cookie banner but some kind of opt-out form from collecting and selling data.\n\nHope that helps!",

Big companies submit to this expectation and publish their content for free, which strengthens the mindset of the users.\n\nBut the big companies still need to make money, so they turn to ads, as a way to gain money of their content. \"If you're not paying for the product, you are the product\" is the perfect phrase in this example.

Back to the internet: we eventually started blocking these ads because they suck and we could, but we did so without thinking of the affect it had on the creators of the content we actually wanted. Those creators then have to either get more aggressive ads to make up the difference (or find other streams like newsletters and offers).

I was referring to his response in the comments to the guy who just responded \"Get rid of the stupid useless ads\", and he explains the costs that go in and ask for a better model.\n\nHowever, I think you are inadvertently proving my point. You see this guy asking for a small donation to cover the cost of work he has done and hosted and tons of others have consumed based on the traffic to his site, but you use words like \"begging\" and say he has the \"audacity\" to ask for a donation for support, strengthening the argument that people generally have a strong aversion to donating for things like this. Maybe you're implying that because it's based on a copyrighted work and his original monetization plan fell through, he should eat the costs entirely, but wouldn't that apply to any content creator that leverages other work, such as reviewers, streamers, or youtubers that do lets plays, critics, etc.?\n\nThousands of people have visited his site looking for content like this. I also get why they are not willing to pay for it - it's not life changing to see or read this stuff, but they get value out of it, even if they wouldn't go out and buy a book of the relationships between dark characters.\n\nYou are telling me that the link I provided is a terrible example of my point. If you aren't convinced from the above, it doesn't really matter - because the key question is - how can these content creators monetize and get paid to at least break even, if not profit off their work?\n\nEDIT: I should state for the record, I also \\*hate\\* ads. This is why they're not on my app. I spent a lot of time and effort designing a clean aesthetic and I don't want to pollute it with ads. However, I also know that there is a limit to how much I am willing to spend out of pocket to provide a service for others, and at some point, if I can't find another way to monetize, I'll have little choice - take my app down, or introduce ads.

And most companies don't know how to take advantage of the user information they get from these popups.\n\nLike everything else in 2020, it just doesn't make sense.\n\nAdd to that all the people who just think it is ok to put advertising on their web sites without any configuration.  And they all use the same two or three providers for the ads, so everybody has to see the exact same ads no matter what website they visit.  Most people know better than to click on any of these ads, except for those of minimal intellect who actually think that ad is a real article.\n\nAnd we also don't have a single web search engine that actually serves the end user, so we are back to 1999.  Information is harder to find now than ever before.\n\nNothing makes sense.",

And nobody will actively sort it out if whenever the issue is brought up, it's dismissed because \"it will be sorted out\".\n\nBesides which, the web's not *that* young - website ads date back to the early 90s, so that makes it 25-30 years old. Also, there's a multi-billion-dollar company based off it called Google that's 22 years old.",

The network is being actively manipulated by people who don‚Äôt care about the experience of any other people.  The original page rank algorithm was manipulated and gamed by web sites in a manner that led to the erosion of its effectiveness. \nWe need a way to establish trust on the web, especially trust in information sources and individuals.  Things need to be organized in a way that the web serves the individual first and foremost.  Failing that, it will eventually serve nobody very well, as in our current situation.

That's a given. But - the client is unwilling to budge on fixing the cookie; apparently it is used by multiple vendors. The spaces seem to be widely supported by most browsers, but... I'm not a fan of doing something \"just because it works\" or \"just because it's common.\" I'm sure it's low risk to add an exception for those spaces, but am I wrong in pushing the client to update their side? Should we just roll over and add the exception? Doesn't give me warm fuzzies.\n\nEDIT: Why in the actual frak is this getting downvoted?",

        "id": "1dufz2c",
        "selftext": "I'm building a web app with React, Redux and Django DRF. \n\nI find myself with a problem. If a user does not logout, just closes the browser, and then comes back to the site, the user remains authenticated, but the csrftoken is an empty string state in Redux. When App.jsx mounts, I want to check browser storage cookies, and if sessionid and csrftoken cookies are set, I want to set those in Redux state also. \n\nI tried using js-cookie and this is what happens:\n\n    import Cookies from 'js-cookie';\n    \n    const App = () => {\n    \n        const cookies = Cookies.get();\n        console.log(\"COOKIES FROM APP\", cookies);\n    \n        for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(cookies)) {\n            console.log(`Cookie: ${key} = ${value}`);\n        }\n    \n        return (\n            <Routes>\n                <Route path=\"/\" element={<Home />} />\n                <Route path=\"/login\" element={<Login />} />\n                <Route\n                    path=\"/dashboard\" \n                    element={<PrivateRoute><Dashboard /></PrivateRoute>} \n                />\n            </Routes>\n        )\n    \n    };\n    \n    export default App;\n    ----------------------------------------------\n    // console.log:\n    COOKIES FROM APP Object {  }\n\nWhile COOKIES FROM APP logs the Object, the following for loop does not iterate/does not log anything to console.\n\nI then thought maybe if I want it on component mount, I need useEffect:\n\n        useEffect(() => {\n            const cookies = Cookies.get();\n            console.log(\"COOKIES FROM APP\", cookies);\n    \n            for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(cookies)) {\n                console.log(`Cookie: ${key} = ${value}`);\n            }\n    \n            const csrfToken = Cookies.get('csrftoken');\n            console.log('CSRF Token From Cookies:', csrfToken);\n        }, []);\n\nBut it still only logs COOKIES FROM APP, and now also CSRF Token From Cookies: undefined.\n\nWhen my one of my components mounts, I dispatch a getSession call, which calls the backend, and returns isAuthenticated bool if there's a session, I then set isAuthenticated in Redux state. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure how to check for presence of CSRF token. If I dispatch fetchCSRFToken action, this will call the backend, and return a new CSRF token:\n\n    # Django views.py\n    \n    def get_csrf(request):\n        response = JsonResponse({'detail': 'CSRF cookie set'})\n        response['X-CSRFToken'] = get_token(request)\n        return response\n    \n    class SessionView(APIView):\n        authentication_classes = [SessionAuthentication, BasicAuthentication]\n        permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]\n    \n        @staticmethod\n        def get(request, format=None):\n            return JsonResponse({'isAuthenticated': True})\n\nIf I set the newly returned token in Redux state, then I end up with a different CSRF token in state, and different one set in browser storage cookies. \n\nHow can I check for presence of csrftoken set in browser storage cookies, so that I can set retrieve it and set it in Redux state?

It's more \"only make auth credentials available where they are actually required\".\n\nThe client (usually) doesn't have any reason to access a cookie, so why allow it? It's not so much that the client can't be trusted, it's more that there's no reason to trust it. \"Trust no-one\" is a standard security best practice.\n\n> But if the client's browser cannot access this httponly cookie\n\nThe browser can access cookies, but generally browsers don't do anything except blindly send them to the server (and delete them when they expire). It's _javascript_ that can't access httponly cookies.\n\n> how do you use this cookie in the header of subsequent responses to authenticate a user session\n\nCookies are sent in all future network requests. That's how cookies work.\n\nIn a very simple implementation, the user enters their username/password, and it'll be sent to the server. The server checks the username/password, then if they're valid it generates random string (I'd personally use a \"Version 4\" UUID) and creates a file on the disk or in a database with that UUID as the filename/database id. In the file or database row, the server records the username and some kind of proof that the user previously provided a valid password (do _not_ store the password as proof, but do derive the proof from the password so that this will be invalidated if the password is reset).\n\nThen on future requests, the server simply reads that file / db record, re-validates the proof of the password, and it then trusts the HTTP request (which might be a javascript API call - or an image - or anything - it doesn't have to be a full page load).",

A password is pretty good proof.\n\nThat includes a 16 year old kid logging onto dad's phone and ordering a Playstation on Amazon. Amazon is required to refund the purchase whenever that happens, and they can't necessarily force the customer to send the Playstation back either. It was an unauthorised payment, and that's Amazon's fault. If Amazon wants the product returned they might need to involve the police, and possibly even take it to a court case. Cheaper to just let them keep the Playstation (after asking nicely for them to please return it).\n\nThe only other recourse Amazon has is to ban the customer's account.\n\nOh, and if refunds happen too often, Visa/Mastercard won't let you charge anyone's credit card. That would be bad.\n\nIf it was me, I'd only require a transaction for large purchases or if something is suspicious, like an IP address from an unexpected location.",

So for example maybe we only want this UUID to live for 1 hour, so we'd add a column called 'expires on' where we insert getDate() + 1hr when generating the initial token.\nThen return a 401 status if getDate() > 'expires on' I guess?\n\nAnd I guess if you want to normalize the database for optimization and a super speedy token checks you could have a separate auth table clustered about the server-side user ID that contains columns for the UUID and expire datetime to verfity the token and the token's lifetime-validity\n\n----\n\nEdit: clarification\n\nEdit 2: reread what you said and Google it. Cookies already have expired times in them, but like you said, trust no one. So is it standard practice to still double check the server-side-generated 'expire-by' time? I don't want to trust a client-returned cookie's supposed self-identified expire-by time",

        "selftext": "(This should be a farily straightforward question, but I can't find straightforward answers to this after quite a bit of searching):\n\nWhat is every website that uses Google Analytics doing when if their users hit Reject or ignore the cookie consent altogether?\n\nAll the cookie-consent examples and boilerplates I find on the Internet seem to have Accept/Reject buttons where the Reject button does nothing.\n\nHowever, let's take the use-case of a website where cookies are necessary for it to work. Session cookies, yes I know those don't need consent. However, basics things like Google analytics and I guess even third-party login do.\n\nSo my question is, what happens if the user clicks Reject or ignores, and the website still loads analytics scripts? Is the webapp technically in non-compliance?\n\nIn that case, what is even the point of having Accept and Reject buttons? Isn't it better to just have an \"OK\" button and mention something like \"Don't use this website if you don't agree\" or so (similar to terms & conditions)?\n\nHOWEVER, I think the above is also not in GDPR compliance, with something like: \"...access to services and functionalities must not be made conditional on the consent of a user‚Ä¶ (so-called cookie walls)\" in the [guidelines](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf).\n\nSo in that case, I am wondering... what exactly do/should webapps do when a user rejects cookies? Just not load (say) analytics scripts? Wait for a cookie consent \"Accept\" before loading the script? How does this work with third-party logins (say Auth0)?\n\nAnd what should be the behavior if the user ignores the cookie consent altogeher, clicks neither Accept or Reject? Do you refrain from loading Google Analytics / Facebook pixel onto the page then? And in that case how does (should) third party login like auth0 work, if at all? (or are those exempt, being considered essential?)",

Here's a simplified version of what I'm doing in my middleware:\n\n`export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {`\n\n  `const response = NextResponse.next();`\n\n  `const { city, country } = geolocation(request);`\n\n  `const geo = { city, country };`\n\n  `response.cookies.set('userGeoData', JSON.stringify(geo), { httpOnly: false });`\n\n  `return response;`\n\n`}`\n\nThen, in my React components, I'm reading this cookie to access the geolocation data.\n\n\n\n2. Storing visitor email:\n\nWhen a visitor submits a form with their email (without being authenticated), I'm storing this email in a cookie for later use to pre-fill forms.\n\n\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is using cookies a good practice for storing geolocation data? Are there security or performance concerns I should be aware of?\n\n2. Are there better alternatives to cookies for handling geolocation data in a Next.js app?\n\n3. Is it okay to store a visitor's email in cookies when they're not authenticated? Are there any privacy or security issues with this approach?\n\n4. How would you handle these scenarios (geolocation and visitor email) in a Next.js app?\n\n\n\nI want to ensure I'm following best practices for data handling and user privacy. Any insights or alternative approaches would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

If the user isn't logged in on twitter.com either then twitter.com just says \"nope.\" If the user is logged in on twitter.com, it responds with a payload (JWT or something similar) that gives a username and a one-off login token. The Twitter server also registered that token with X so that when the browser then makes its next request to X with the new token, X can say, \"Yep, you're logged in.\"\n\nThere are people here saying they have set `SameSite=none` on their login cookies. If so, that's incredibly stupid as it will allow any site to steal your Twitter and X account. I don't have a Twitter login handy to check if this is how they've done it or not, but it's not necessary to make this work; the \"lax\" setting is intended for this sort of use.",

        "author": "saintpetejackboy",
        "id": "1mcyp2j",
        "selftext": "I have tasted a ton of languages and frameworks in my life, especially recently. I worked with Next.js a bit a few years back, and I don't know if something changed or somehow I forgot how to program, but in my 20+ years of development, I want to say I had fun the vast majority of the time. Until this most recent Next.js project.\n\nMy most recent excursion into Next.js left me needing therapy. I don't even know where to begin.\n\n\nTo get passkey authentication working at first was wonky, and required a ton of debugging. No big deal, passkey can sometimes give me some difficulty in situations where I have already done a dozen implementations, so I didn'r really realize or notice that something was \"wrong\".\n\nMuch further into the project, I noticed all kinds of weird rendering aberrations. Not a big deal, figured I could clean them up later.\n\nThen, I noticed that some views caused the sessions to just vanish. I tried cookies, database, client-side, server side... I ever tried making multiple views depending on if the user was authenticated or not.\n\nI felt like Charlie Brown or Charlie Chapman. I would fix one bug, just for another to appear. Things would work, then suddenly not work. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to what was causing all of the headache, and I must have basically \"rewrote\" the entire thing several times over - solving one problem just to introduce anorher in the process.\n\nI used every AI model known to man. I dusted off StackOverflow. I crawled back to Google like a bum.\n\nAt the end of the day, I just decided I couldn't take it any more. I may have kept going further before noticing these terrible issues, the good news is that the price was basically completed for 90%+ of what I was trying to do when this finally manifested in such a way that I realzied I was going to have to change languages. I was literally at the \"ahhh, this is complete except for whatever niceties I want to add as cherry on top\", and suddenly noticed \"hmm, why is my admin user being logged out suddenlt when I navigate to this certain page or refresh?\" And that caused this spiral into one of the worst levels of hell I have ever experienced.\n\nFixed admin? Guests are broken. Fixed guests and admin? Regular users are broken. Fixed regular users? Well, admin is broken now. Fixed admin? Nope, now none of them work. It was absolute torture.\n\nDo people really develop with this? \n\nI sat and thought and I just can't comprehend. Even if I looked past all those weird rendering abnormalities and some of the other things where I wasn't entirely satisfied, not being able to have users or admins have a persistent and reliable session was a deal breaker for me and a hard no.\n\nI know, I know, everybody reading this is going to go \"lol, n00b, sounds like a skill issue\", and I concede, I am not the best at any language, let alone Next.js - but I have NEVER had such an unresolvable problem doing passkey authentication before... Not even in Next.js itself, some time ago now (years?, I can't even recall). Did something change? Is something fundamentally different about Next.js now? \n\nTop tier worst development experience I feel like I have ever encountered. Ton of work and pain in the ass every step of the way for what amounred to be zero payoff when I just rm -rf the whole directory at the end.\n\nI want my money back!\n\nEven though it was free.",

So things like user data can be easily passed on and accessed when needed.

But in our case we really had no reasons to use Next. I didn't enjoy working with it but there were so many other factors.",

It comes with a lot of footguns though, and if you're not at least 3 YOE as a React dev it's going to be really painful. It also makes the experience of learning React from scratch a lot worse. I can't imagine being like an entry level React dev rn, that shits gotta suck.\n\nIt also might not be the final version of \"fullstack React\" frameworks, which is why I call it a step in the right direction. There are some abstractions which are clunky. Server/Client components are clunky. I personally don't like path based routing (and thought we spent all of the early 2000s learning that it was a bad idea). But it feels far more like \\*it\\* than .NET, Spring, Rails, Laravel, Django, etc.\n\nThe things it does right:\n\n* Is a full stack framework focused on front end. I think this is where the MVC frameworks get it wrong. I don't want to conceptualize in terms of API routes. I want to conceptualize my user routes in terms of their dependencies. If you agree that declarative style code is ideal (which is most people who love React) then being able to simply define your entire view in terms of even server-side data seems like the ideal state.\n* Provides a mostly unopinionated backend, which is ideal for sophisticated products done by seniors who don't want some ORM system, middleware, etc. Or perhaps don't need it, e.g. BFFs. Anyway, I hear a lot of complaints that it's not a kitchen sink, but I think most people who prefer Node prefer it for that reason. \n* Is full Typescript, allowing you to share types between client/server easily. Most of the people don't realize that the #1 reason something like this becomes popular is because people are *not going back* to PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, or C#. The fact that my build scripts, backend, frontend, etc is all in the same language using the same type system is a make or break issue for me.\n* First class, native support for React. Best case scenario in other frameworks you have something like Laravel with Inertia, but most projects you find in the wild aren't using React at all and are utilizing ERB, Blade, Razor, etc. *You will not gain modern adoption* to your framework if it has anything approximating:`{% block title %}{{ section.title }}{% endblock %}`\n\nUltimately for a lot of React devs, once you get ahold of server components and can straight up make a DB query inside of a React component (bad example, but you get it) there's no going back.",

Not two nights and resulting in me abandoning it. I went directly from that project to both a Go and a Python project where I had zero issues implementing the same setup. I have done it so many times in PHP that I could do it in my sleep. Same for Rust. \n\nThat is why, in my mind I said \"hmm, something is wrong here\", because I normally am the first one to just blame myself for being a shitty programmer and not knowing what I am doing (which was still the case here, obviously), but there is no reason this one task in this framework should have been so difficult. The very first time I *ever* did passkey authentication was basically the day Google announced they supported it (at that point, all the major companies were on board) and it was nowhere near as easy as it eventually became but it was also nowhere near as difficult as trying to do it in Next.js\n\nThat shouldn't be the case, and a lot of the fanboys here down voted my comments to oblivion (despite the post itself not doing bad, a better indicator of overall sentiment from people who aren't rabid about the only framework they know and suffering Stockholm Syndrome), others were helpful in pointing out that this framework does have its own quirks and issues and that it may be worth it to push past some of them.\n\nI just have a hard time rationalizing that approach after what I experienced - I wasn't pushing bleeding edge stuff, the latest stable version of everything should work the way it is documented to work and not require me doing guesswork. Long before the auth issues, it was already feeling like a janky setup that was going to be a headache as it grew in complexity. Compared to something like Rust where I can just use cargo mindlessly without having to concern myself over if I am grabbing not just the right version of a package but the right package entirely, or what version of documentation I am reading (I can't give this same pass to Python, but the same holds true for PHP and Go ecosystems where everything \"just works\" out of the box, they way it says it does and the way it logically should).\n\nJavaScript shouldn't be harder than Rust, but Next.js certainly felt like it.",

Much of the JS ecosystem, is, in my experience, NOT geared towards that type of paradigm. A lot of major PHP stuff has also moved away from it over the years.\n\nIt is an offensive and untrue thing to say, but \"PHP is just a wrapper for C\" used to be a common insult (and, most languages borrow tons of C libraries, and have ways to load C code... Most people reading this probably use cURL on a daily basis). And one thing PHP did prepare me for was \"C-like languages\", the syntax and control flow, anyway, and while JS and even TS feel similar, whatever abstraction Next.js framework is doing for the backend doesn't feel very \"C-like\", to me and the entire process of how stuff was working under the hood was difficult for me to wrap my head around the entire time, I didn't feel like a strong enough distinction between the frontend and backend and kept getting confused in my own code as to what was actually going on.\n\nThere are also studies about the different paradigms and it seems some people are wired a certain way to not be OOP. IIRC these same studies also said it is difficult for people like me to learn OOP who didn't learn it first, but that there are also mental differences between the two paradigms on a more physical level that explain why some people program one way versus another.\n\nI thought this would be an advantage going into Next.js based on what I read about how it worked, but I found myself feeling like I was in C# or something the entire time - the syntax felt vaguely familiar but the implementations were just nonsensical to me, I couldn't make heads or tails out of what was actually going on for the client and what was going on for the server, even with extremely verbose logging and debugging, nothing about the process was making sense to me.\n\nAs I mentioned elsewhere, doing a proxy through Apache2 probably wasn't helping me enjoy the experience very much, either. It normally adds an extra step of complexity on top of other setups, but I should have run with an nginx setup instead and I believe I could have avoided some of the headaches I had on the first day.\n\nI have messed around a bit with Node.js prior, and even some other backend frameworks (express mainly), and I always had a dislike for using JS on the backend, I only even first explored Node.js as a way for running web sockets and push notifications many years ago, and it is one thing PHP sucks at (and I didn't know Rust at the time or understand how to accomplish the same things in Python - when I leaned Python (or started to) was actually *before* I learned PHP ... Before PHP supported OOP, so in that timeframe or wasn't even close to the same language it is today - I don't think it supported web sockets for another decade or more after that). I still use Node.js in some areas to handle just these tasks (including very recently) and it does a great job at that.\n\nIt may just be that, even outside of Next.js being totally at fault here, that I just don't like JS in general on the backend, and probably should have realized that a bit better going in. The easiest and friendliest setups to me are PHP, and not just because it is my native language, but because of how dirt cheap it is (mentally) to do stuff like routing and templating - but I have long since migrated to also running Go, Python, Nose.js and Rust alongside my PHP spaghettis to fill the gap where PHP lacks (anything async, basically, or heavy file I/O, or complex database interactions where speed is critical). I am always excited and open to trying different stuff and was optimistic Next.js might be a way for me to condense that stack down some, by going full JS everywhere. \n\nIt was a bad idea, overall. \n\nI did the same project discussed above more fully fleshed out in Go in almost no time, with React still on the frontend - and Go wasn't perfect the whole time, but I felt it was a faster development experience than Rust and much faster performance than PHP. I probably won't switch to Go full-time, but I thoroughly enjoyed the whole process and had *fun* going fully in on Go for the backend.\n\nI don't program because people pay me to program, I have been programming since long before anybody paid me to do it and I program regardless of if I am being paid to do it. I just enjoy it, it is fun to me. I am not in the industry to make money, I am just a big nerd. Next.js just wasn't fun for me, and I didn't like it, at the end of the day: it felt like \"work\", which is unfortunate.\n\nI am extremely stubborn, however, and will likely end up giving Next.js another go, on a proper environment and on an older set of packages, with a different auth library and see if I can't just wrangle it into working :(.",

        "id": "1fd3ts8",
        "selftext": "### What I have understood (I guess):\n\n1. **Cross-origin Cookies**:  \n   Cookies set with `Domain=\"example.com\"` are not sent with `fetch` requests from origins like `hello.example2.com` to `mywebsite.example.com` because they are different domains. However, I am aware there might be a malicious workaround for this via `<form>`(point 3).\n\n2. **Fetch Requests and `SameSite` Behavior**:  \n   With `SameSite=\"Strict\"`, cookies set with `Domain=\"example.com\"` are included in `fetch` requests from subdomains like `frontend.example.com`, but not from unrelated domains like `hello.test.example.com`. With `SameSite=\"None\"`, cookies should be sent even from different subdomains if they belong to the same domain.\n\n3. **Form Submissions and Cookies**:  \n   Form submissions from different domains, like `hello.example2.com`, include cookies when `SameSite=\"None\"`, but not when `SameSite=\"Strict\"`. HTML forms bypass CORS restrictions since they directly open the target URL.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Questions:\n\n1. **How do companies like Google and Amazon manage to track users across multiple external domains?**  \n   Given that EVEN if Google set their cookies with `SameSite=None`, the requests made by `fetch` from a website.com (which uses google adsense and has a google.com/trackme url) cannot include the Google cookie since it's another domain, how do these companies effectively use cookies to track users across various external domains and websites?\n\n2. **Why does setting `domain: \"frontend.example.com\"` cause the cookie not to be set properly?**  \n   When I put in my backend the setting `domain: \"frontend.example.com\"` for a cookie to be used specifically by the frontend website, the cookie is not set in frontend as expected and the frontend stops working. How can I ensure that `frontend.example.com` can use the cookie while preventing `test3.example.com` from accessing it? What should I configure to achieve this?",

I have been messing around with a personal project using vanilla js, flask, and supabase and have been super confused about how client-side and server-side authentication are supposed to work in tandem, which is more of a big picture security question, maybe. (I've looked all over SO, reddit, and chatgpt and can't seem to find a straight forward answer). Please let me know where I've gone wrong. This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17shju0/are_cookies_really_safer_than_localsession_storage/) didn't really help me, and my networking knowledge is weak in general.\n\nSay I've logged a user in and have an access token on the server side from my request to supabase, which authenticated the email/pw creds. The login response (to the client's login request) should set the browser's cookies which include this access token (as a JWT, for example).  I don't think it should matter that the DBS is supabase in this case, as access tokens have to come from somewhere. \n\nNow, say the user wants to see some data that is private to them. The browser sends a request for this data with cookies by default, which the server can read and authenticate, and can be set to time out or only survive the life of the window in the browser, etc. \n\n  \nThis does not seem secure at all. Cookies are not inherently secure, and packet sniffing makes any browser-hiding of information irrelevant. JWTs are not really encrypted, just signed (I think?). How can my server actually distinguish between legitimate requests from the original browser session that originally logged in and someone sniffing packets between the server and browser that could use the access token found in those cookies to make malicious requests? \n\n\n\n",

Kudos to you for thinking about security when just starting out, most don't care about security until there's been a breach of some kind. If you want to know more about the specific attack vector you're describing with the packet sniffing, it's called a combination of a [Man in the Middle Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) and [Session Hijacking](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/session-hijacking/#:~:text=Session%20hijacking%20refers%20to%20the,to%20ensure%20continuity%20and%20security). \n\nNow, I don't know much exactly what you're specific configuration is, but there are two pieces to this puzzle that help keep all of this secure so that the middleware won't be able to sniff packets, but there is one crucial assumption that has to be addressed first. That assumption is that the client and server are not directly compromised, for if the attacker has direct access to either the client or server, all bets are off when talking about network communication security.\n\nFirst is the utilization of HTTP over SSL/TLS (HTTPS) is the first counter measure to this. If you want to go in depth learning about the TLS handshake between the client and server, or understanding exactly what and how the transmitted packets are encrypted, there are tons of resources on line. But in essence this makes sure when transmitted, all information is end-to-end encrypted, meaning the middle man can not sniff any of the headers out of the requests which would compromise the client.\n\nSecond is the usage of secure cookies, which when boiled down to it, is a flag that the browser respects to ensure the cookie will only ever be transmitted over secure channels. So this means that if the client software were to accidentally try to make a request over HTTP instead of HTTPS (maybe even due a cross site scripting attack) the browser would not include the cookies in the request that are marked with the secure flag. So this is an added safeguard on top of using HTTPS to ensure the important cookies will not be transmitted via insecure means.\n\nI know this is a lot, but I hope it helps to fill in some of the gaps that you had after your original post you linked.",

You can send this token on each service request (as part of the payload or request header). It does mean that upon each visit (where the page is loaded freshly) the client needs to login again, but your navigation should in this case just navigate within the SPA routing, meaning this ideally never happens. You could also keep it in SessionStorage so that the login is valid for as long as the browser isn't closed (but this comes with a potential security risk on shared computers).\n\nThe privacy policy should list what each cookie is used for in the context of making your application work.

                "body": "I'd like to point out that the \"Cookie\" in cookie warnings is not actually cookies. That's one of the biggest misconceptions and misnomers that has caused so many of the problems we currently see with lack of compliance. \"Cookies\" in this case refers to any automatic collection (and further storage, processing, etc) of data. Back when the \"Cookie law\" got it's shorthand name, Cookies just happened to be the most worrisome example of the process.\n\nA lot of American tech people have taken the cookie warnings to mean that they need the users permission to store data on the users computer (i.e. a cookie). That's actually the opposite of the reality -- they only need the users permission if they are going to collect data and use it for a purpose other than the one that would be obvious to the user. An IP address is a great example, because I obviously need a return address in order to send you a response to your request -- however the fact that I needed it for the one purpose doesn't give me the right to use it for any other purpose (like looking up what region you're connecting from) without your explicit consent and awareness that I'm going to do that. Cookies are out of date -- they're still used, but they are by far not the main way that data is collected or processed, so calling a requirement to get the Users consent to collect data for analytics a \"Cookie Consent\" is just misleading. \n\nThe second biggest misunderstanding in my opinion is Americans misinterpretation of \"Personal Information\" as PII. In the States, PII refers to individual identifiers -- as in the identifier is an individual piece of information. In Europe, the GDPR simply refers to Personal Information as any information about a person -- like your eye color. That information doesn't have to be able to identify you, but it's about you, so it's YOUR information (as in there's a sense of ownership and since the information is about you, you own that information and you get to choose what other people are allowed to do with it). It starts to get confusing when the law defines it as any information, that when combined with other information, can be used to identify a unique individual. That starts to sounds like PII, but that's just side effect of the fact that it's personal, and this is why legally, there's pretty much no such thing as Anonymous data. If you have some data about a person, and you remove the \"personal identifier\", it's still that persons personal data. All you've actually done is remove your ability to correct it or delete it if that person asks you to. Unless you can prove that that data could plausibly belong to 10 or more people, you haven't legally \"anonymized\" it. \n\nMy favorite example of the Anti Cookie Consent popup is Reuters -- it starts with the title \"Right to Withdraw Consent under GDPR\" -- imagine you skipped the fine print and went straight to the two button options \"Accept All\" (highlighted) or \"Show Purposes\" -- Why yes! I would absolutely like to Accept ALL of my Rights to Withdraw Consent! Oh, but wait, that's not what they meant... If you actually go through the effort of reading the two paragraphs of fine print (not clicking on any of the links), they aren't written in intelligible English. I don't mean it's just confusing, wrong or misleading (all of which it is), I mean it actually doesn't make any coherent sense. It's like when you go back and fix a sentence you've already written but forget to proofread it after you make your changes and consequently have a sentence that isn't grammatically meaningful.",

If the token is used for authentication then using an `HttpOnly` cookie is more secure than storing it in localstorage. If JavaScript has access to the cookie then so do any 3rd party dependencies your app uses. There's also a slim chance that the user has disabled browser storage.\n\nAlso, if you use `SameSite: lax` the cookie can be sent to the server on page load so you know who the authenticated user is when rendering your app.",

        "title": "Third-Party Cookies Being Phased Out: A Question Regarding HTTP-Only Cookies",
        "author": "irbaye",
        "id": "1d72gra",
        "selftext": "Please correct me if I am wrong! \n\nDecoupling is how most applications are built‚Äîseparating the client from the backend. This approach works well because it separates concerns. \n\nWhen authenticating users, access tokens are used to validate requests and process them in the backend. Many tutorials suggest storing access tokens in¬†`localStorage`, which seems convenient. However, further research reveals that this approach is prone to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. \n\nSo, what is the solution? \n\nHTTP-only cookies! With HTTP-only cookies, JavaScript cannot access the token, and it is sent to the server with every request. **Isn‚Äôt that great?** Well, it‚Äôs an improvement, but now we encounter the problem of CSRF. Fortunately, this can be mitigated using the¬†`SameSite`¬†attribute. So, is this a good solution? Yes.\n\nNow, my question relates to the phase-out of third-party cookies in the Chrome browser. I keep encountering an error message: *‚ÄòThird-party cookie will be blocked.‚Äô* Will all websites that rely on saving HTTP-only cookies be affected once the phase-out begins, especially for applications with React apps on different domains",

Not to mention the fact that not all devices will have an actual GPS, and instead default to IP or Google WiFi location. The latter of which is pretty damn accurate, but scammers probably won't enable location.\n\nTracing by IP address doesn't need the browser location access, though. You can easily built this into your backend, as it's tied to the request. It's very common to see IP ranges blacklisted on firewalls, such as botnets and known malicious sources. There's just 2 caveats here.\n\n1. IP's aren't always reliable, the location you get from IP tracing is based on the ISP that owns it. Which is usually tied to the correct country, but it doesn't have to be. VPNS will also easily circumvent this.\n\n2. IP addresses are considered personal data under GDPR. So you will need to request explicit consent in something like a cookie bar. But you'll need to actually reference the GDPR guidelines on this. \n\nYou should be able to block entire IP ranges, though. As you're not tying them to individual data. This is basically how a lot of US websites block out all of the EU at the moment. \n\nNote: I'm not a legal expert, I only have some basic knowledge on GDPR based on what I had to implement.",

But, yes, if their IP switches it's gone. Not to mention the fact that some ISPs give the same IP to multiple households.  \n\nThere's also browser fingerprinting to look into, but browsers also have built-in tools to mitigate those. It's just a tricky situation. The privacy focused mindset of today makes it so there's plenty of tools to make it hard to verify people based on any form of data.\n\nBy the way, GDPR doesn't ban tracking, you just need to provide the user with a clear document stating what data you're collecting, and why you're collecting it. There's nothing stopping you from disallowing users from operating on the platform if they do not opt in to certain data collection, such as location.

Authentication logic should be in the backend only, not touching Next.js. Zero-trust.\n2. Next.js is able to authenticate to make requests for server-rendered pages to the API, but ONLY using the client's credentials.\n3. Client is also aware of its login state for client-side render changes.\n4. User doesn't need to log in frequently, so a refresh token is required.\n5. Session management is stateless as far as the API is concerned (achievable using JWTs).\n\nI thought for a while on the best way to handle this; I read that HTTP-only cookies are considered the best from a security perspective for XSS protection. So, I settled on using HTTP-only cookies. A user would log in, and 2 cookies would be set by the API: an access token, scoped to both the site and the API (since they share a domain, that way Next.js can read that cookie and make authenticated calls if needed), and a refresh token, scoped to only the authentication endpoints (to reduce exposure). The login request would return a JSON containing the expiration times, so the browser can know its token statuses to refresh and redirect back to login.\n\nNow, I've actually tried to start implementing it, and it seems that from the tutorials I'm seeing that using a JWT in cookies is pretty rare (or just using cookies in general for a backend API). It seems like using an \"Authorization: Bearer\" header is strongly preferred. Is what I'm doing considering an antipattern? If local storage isn't considered secure enough to store my refresh token, what other options do I really have for maintaining login between sessions? ",

''; ?>';\n            // Prepare data for submission\n            const formData = {\n                oldPassword: oldPassword,\n                newPassword: newPassword,\n                _token: csrfToken // Include CSRF token in the request body\n            };\n            // Send password change request using fetch\n            fetch('updatePassword.php', {\n                method: 'POST',\n                headers: {\n                    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n                },\n                body: JSON.stringify(formData)\n            })\n\nIn the browser DevTools I do NOT see the CSRFToken as a cookie.  And consequentally, when I access the updatePassword.php script the $\\_COOKIE variable does not contain the CSRFToken that I set using setcookie on the login page.\n\nAny guidance would be appreciated to help me figure out why the cookie is not working as I expect it to.",

It should be able to handle atleast aroud 30 to 60 users login and their session. Currently we are similating user with  dedicated puppeteer window because per page/tab login doesn't work because of cookies and session.\n\nI've comeup with extension named SessionBox which achieves this and I've tested with it, however it's having some extra steps everytime you want to open tab with isolated session and it's also paid extension so I don't think I will be able to convince my lead to use it.\n\nAny way I can achieve this in Puppeteer with chrome (firefox seems slow than chrome that's why)? or can build this extension for myself ?\n\nHow does this SessionBox extension work ? What should be business logic/flow ?\n\nEnglish is my second language so please don't mind if something sounds in wrong tone.\n\nThanks.",
