GDPR alone could be millions in fines for not complying if you have EU data subjects in scope, and I'm guessing the breaches go far beyond just these actions if they really wanted to dig the knife in.¬†\n¬†\n\nLong answer, if your company is small and flies under the radar, and doesn't have anyone angry enough to flag this behavior and raise it to governmental bodies, it will likely never result in any actions or would first be a set of orders to cease doing this and comply with a set of corrective actions. Hiring a data protection consulting firm for $20k for an analysis and remediation project and showing the actions taken would likely be enough to avoid fines.¬†\n¬†\n\nSource: full time data protection and data privacy consultant 6 years ago, less familiar with CAN-SPAM but did GDPR and CCPA full time.¬†",

It rests on the B2B contract your employer made with the client. Also, in the US no one cares about this stuff until they get hit with a lawsuit, and most companies don't unless they get too big, which is a good problem to have anyways.\n\nIf you are a freelancer/contractor and a part of your role/duties specifically include certain compliance in your contract(s), than the negligence damage (in the case of a lawsuit) could fall onto you - but that's only if you signed and acknowledged that.\n\nGenerally though, proving willful misconduct/negligence can be tough, and also most freelancers and small businesses should have insurance for these scenarios especially if they are working with riskier things. Just like almost every doctor has medical malpractice insurance, because they will inevitably get sued for it at some point of their career.\n\nSide note: I once worked for a client that was requesting similar things, except they wanted to be compliant with an \"opt-in\" checkbox, but they wanted it to be checked by default, which is not totally legal.. everywhere. But their legal team said it was in the state the company was based in. It's a complex thing. It is what it is.

I worked for 3 days and during that time they performed a background check without my consent, then held a meeting outside of HR to discuss my criminal history and whether they still wanted to work with me (despite the fact that it was in no way relevant to my job). This is all a violation of California employment law (ban the box)\n\n\nThe CEO sent me a text message explaining that on signal, which he had set up as disappearing messages. He put all the damning admissions of what they had done in writing and I captured them with the screen recording function on my phone (there were also a lot of admissions related to what I had been hired to do in there).\n\n\nI brought my evidence to a law firm in LA that specializes in employment disputes, we agreed to a 50/50 split, the lawfirm contacted my former employer with a demand letter, and my former employer decided it was best to settle. We negotiated a bit and finally settled on a number we could all live with and they cut me a check.¬†\n\n\nMoral of the story: If you are a company hiring someone specifically to do a dirty job, don't assume that the person who agrees to do it is an idiot that's going to make a good patsy. Alternatively, if you are hired for a job where you are being asked to do things that are probably illegal, document everything in real time and make offline backups daily.",

At the same time, it shows users that something is happening, unlike a generic loader, where you have no idea what‚Äôs going on or if the site is even working.

Also, the stupid cookie notifications. There needs to be a better way to do all this, I'm sorry.\n\n2. Auto-play videos. Please just don't. Ever.\n\n3. Not having a way back to the homepage. I prefer links to open in new windows or tabs, but at the least, give me an obvious way home or I will get annoyed.\n\n4. Excessive graphics and impossible-to-read text. Visually, sure, it looks cool...but again, from a functional standpoint, it's annoying. \n\n5. Anything resembling a 2015 Buzzfeed listicle with a billion images, animations, and memes that takes 500 years to load and completely disrupts my browsing experience.\n\n6. Forms that don't allow me to save my progress. I realize the control over this is possibly limited, but, just saying.\n\n7. Things Getting In The Way Of Other Things. A text description when I mouse over a menu that gets in the way of being able to read the menu items. A pop-up from some AI bullshit asking if I want help or chat support, that gets in the way of being able to apply search filters. The Accessibility options icon getting in the way on the rare occasion I do need chat support.\n\n8. Cryptic icons.

In this scenario a skeleton is a good solution.\n\nI do think it's important to limit this as much as possible, though, instead of relying on it. An example that has always annoyed me: YouTube. Why do I need the whole page to be a skeleton loader? Why can't that shell come from the server? Twitter used to be the same. In fact, it's the same with most social media platforms. A lot of the page you see before the main content shouldn't need a skeleton loader for it to show.\n\nIn my experience, CLS generally comes from unoptimised images (and/or video), images (and/or video) without correct width/height attributes (or aspect ratio), or the annoying fact that you can't set a dynamic width/height on a responsive image (yet).",

        "author": "lolcatsayz",

        "selftext": "I'm a digital nomad, all my sites are offshore and my business model isn't based in the US, UK, EU or other jurisdiction that implemented these draconian cookie popup consent laws that have killed the UI experience of the Internet since 2018. \n\nI personally hate the GDPR popups. They detract from my user experience, and I'm sure I'm not the only one that finds them annoying.\n\nIn order to give a more positive user experience with less distractions to my users, I'm thinking of not placing any cookie notification popups anywhere on my sites. What's the worse that could happen considering my sites aren't based within any jurisdiction that introduced these draconian laws? Will I be whisked away in a black jet to a private detention center?\n\nSerious insights appreciated as opposed to whether or not implementing these cookie popups is \"moral\" or not, thanks.\n\nUpdate: I just want to clarify I am vehemently against 3rd party cross-site tracking for data harvesting and advertising purposes without consent. I'm also against popups of all forms as I find them intrusive and don't wish to subjugate my users to them either. I personally don't use cookies to track my users any further than is needed for the functionality of the website they're on, and hence why I don't wish to display any annoying cookie notices. Personally I use adblockers and cookie blockers and only opt-in to cookies that I desire by myself through these extensions. When a website bothers me with additional cookie popups, it impacts my user experience negatively.\n\nUpdate 2: These cookie popups destroy the UI experience without doing anything positive because if users didn't want to give consent for cookies, they could just install an adblocker, like I do. If they want a site to use cookies, they can turn the adblocker off for that site. This is a simple solution that doesn't destroy the UI experience of the Internet. I stand by what I said: Requiring cookie consent confirmation is a terrible concoction by politicians with little thought as to how this extra action on *every single website you visit* (which often doesn't remember your selection) affects user experience. It's government overreach, plain and simple.",

If that doesn't work technically, ethically, and practically, the entirety of the GDPR is rendered wholly ineffective. The phucking cookie popups and app privacy notices are the most common places in which this consent process takes place, and it's a total clusterphuck. It's a blind \"I agree\" that your beloved GDPR has now conditioned people to just click. The GDPR is rendered useless if the consent process is ineffective. \n\nI think the GDPR should have focused on getting browser and OS vendors to properly implement system-wide privacy settings that can be transmitted in the form of HTTP request headers (such as the DNT/GPC headers), parameters in OAuth handshakes and JWT auths, etc. that would allow for a completely unobtrusive privacy setting that can be transmitted under the hood once it has been clearly set by the user in their browser settings (or in the case of apps, their OS). Things like DNT headers already had definition, and some browsers already had settings for them. The problem is no one respected the setting. The GDPR should have required that they be honored, and expanded on the proposed DNT header standard with something like the GPC. The GPC is relatively new and is aimed at *trying* to be GDPR compliant. That type of standard should have been defined, documented, and made mandatory from the start. It wasn't mandatory because it didn't exist. It's like trying to put the cart before the horse. This is what happens when bureaucrats talk law before talking implementation.

Not sure if it's been done but might be worth looking into.\n\nIn terms of user info, I personally only ever store what's needed for the website and don't use cross-site tracking. If the site requires a user/pass login, then a cookie may be stored for persistence so the user doesn't need to login continuously. All other stored data is only what they've entered on the site itself. That's it. From a moral standpoint I think that's fine and was fine pre-2018. I wish these laws were targeted exclusively toward companies like the big tech ones that spy on users across multiple sites, as opposed to a blanket law applying to every site on the Internet that isn't necessarily using cookies for things outside the site's intended functionality.",

The *control* in the browser is somewhat lacking. There needs to be more controls to allow the functionality that cookies bring without using cookies explicitly, in that we can define authentication functionality separate from other cookie usage. oAuth and Passkey are great examples of steps in the right direction. Abusing cookies just to manage authentication and state seems like it sort of? is backfiring?

Example of such an animation:¬†[https://www.bmwk.de](https://www.bmwk.de/)\n\nI live in the EU, so I come across¬†**a lot**¬†of cookie consent banners every day. While they‚Äôre required by law, most users (myself included) find them really annoying. Let‚Äôs be honest, you just want to click them away as quickly as possible‚Äîeither by accepting or rejecting the cookies.\n\nAs a web dev, I think it‚Äôs our job to make cookie consent banners as¬†**least annoying as possible**. But here‚Äôs the thing: recently, I‚Äôve noticed that many cookie banners use a¬†**fade-in animation**, which not only grabs attention (as animations are supposed to), but the animation is often¬†*so slow*¬†that it just makes the banner even more irritating.\n\nI get why animations are used‚Äîthey‚Äôre designed to make users notice the banner. But why are so many of them¬†**this slow**? I‚Äôve also heard that cookie banners can negatively affect Google PageSpeed scores, so now I‚Äôm wondering: could this slow fade-in animation somehow be a tactic to improve the PageSpeed score?\n\nHere‚Äôs one example of this kind of animation:¬†[BMWK¬†cookie¬†banner](https://www.bmwk.de/). This one isn‚Äôt even the worst I‚Äôve seen‚ÄîI‚Äôve come across banners with even slower animations and clunkier layouts, especially on mobile.\n\nSo, I‚Äôm curious: why do you think so many cookie consent banners have these slow animations? Could it really be related to optimizing Google PageSpeed scores, or is there another reason?",

But other people just don't. They either get lost or swindled.\n\nI hate the obfuscation, semantics thrown out the window, middle clicks and opening in new tabs being blocked, what should be a link is a button or a location.href, what shouldn't be a link... is. Hijacking history states. Unexpected, clickable crap appearing out of nowhere. Autocomplete suggestions changing or disappearing 5 milliseconds before you select them.\n\nI hate when they reinvent the wheel, when they put every single letter of a rich edit box in its separate DOM hierarchy with an entire gigantic tree structure, I hate when they can't just use normal input fields for normal, plain, basic stuff, instead choosing to go for the whatever \"framework native\" method.\n\nI hate how you can't search for specific problems AT ALL these days. If you have ANY issue that isn't the most common cookie cutter problem, then tough luck. Try searching for a problem with, for example, Chrome on your phone. You will only get answers for desktop. Or a problem with a specific car model from a specific year. Lucky if you'll even get a listicle with 10 tips for same brand of cars. **Web search is dead, beyond saving.** LLMs integrated into search only fueling the fire. I am currently having a problem with Windows 11, the taskbar sometimes gets behind maximized windows as if they were on fullscreen, it's NOT a problem with \"auto hide taskbar\", because I'm not even using that, I have to relaunch explorer.exe to fix it. But every search result points me towards that fucking option as if I'm the idiot. And that's all by design. Back in the day you actually were able to find people having the same problems as you. A couple years ago I was complaining how difficult it is to search for phrases with a negating word such as \"not\". Not using the \"-keyword\" with the minus. The preceding sentence serving as a self-referencing example. Oh how naive I was. How happy I was.\n\nI hate how the web is not even indexable, how forums have died and Discord became the king of online communities. How Discord is being used as a... fucking software distribution platform? Same with Patreon? What the fuck is even happening? Am I the insane one? Facebook actively fights indexing too, it's a wasteland.\n\nI hate when they say \"we care about your privacy\". Fuck off. That's the most condescending fake smile piece of bullshit a corporation could say.\n\nI hate enshittification and corporate greed in general. They got us all by the balls those 15 or so years ago when all of their services were oh-so-generously free and they were all operating at a loss, or rather, at a lack of substantial profit. Now they are reaping the benefits. We are the benefits. Every service is becoming worse, the quality is becoming worse, we are being sucked dry of our most intimate personal data, costs being cut left and right, good services becoming bad or discontinued, free services becoming paid, ads are being added to paid services, free services unusable because of ads. The early stages of this are happening to AI now. We are getting accustomed to free of charge AI services. OpenAI has got us by the balls right now already and they **will** reap the benefits of that sooner or later.\n\nI hate how if you are a commercial software developer who has not implemented a SaaS business model yet, you are basically throwing your money away.

Now, I regularly jump from DDG, Brave, Google, and SearX. SearX seems to be the closest to a proper and actual query based search that gives the most actually relevant results. All search does these days is pick the closest related trending keywords that are related to the most high traffic keyword from your query and show ads and top links for the nebulously maybe-related query it decided you _actually_ want to search. It doesn't actually search what you type. As a dev with a long time curse of always having to search for nuance, edge cases, and esoteric bugs, it's hell.\n\nI've wondered if any leetcode high wizards in backend will ever get together and build a straight up traditional search engine that just does a basic literal websearch like Google used to do.

You can get answers there, but the quality tends to be low and the site is not well maintained or moderated.\n\nI agree that google has been lacking severely when it comes to search engine quality results. They have not been able to try to improve their search results for years. As a company they are lackluster in innovation and their customer support is non-existing, except if you spend a lot of money in Adwords.\n\nI would like to see a serious challenger improving search results. I want high quality results with spammy shit filtered out and no low quality newspapers or blog articles and way more options to refine and improve my results. Also google does not explain to newbie users at all how to effectively search - like using \"term\" to have the word term mandatory in search results or using a + between words to make sure both words are in the search results. It is crazy that a company that made their fortune via improving search (altervista was actually same quality but less marketed / pushed and abandoned after Yahoo! bought them) is so uninnovative when it comes to their core origin. Yahoo! also did not innovate at all, kept the cluttered directory style front page for years until people were fed up with it and collapsed. Google is much bigger but is on a down-slope when it comes to innovation as well.\n\nYoutube is a circle jerk and tool for absolute scam artists to promote stupidity, here you also need to use plugins to block stupid channels to keep from getting stupid, just by watching the thumbnails. I recommend BlockTube for that purpose.\n\nOverall I can concur - yes the web has become mainstream and that brings along more stupid people and content, but there is ways around it to filter out the bs.",

You can get answers there, but the quality tends to be low and the site is not well maintained or moderated.\n\nI agree that google has been lacking severely when it comes to search engine quality results. They have not been able to try to improve their search results for years. As a company they are lackluster in innovation and their customer support is non-existing, except if you spend a lot of money in Adwords.\n\nI would like to see a serious challenger improving search results. I want high quality results with spammy shit filtered out and no low quality newspapers or blog articles and way more options to refine and improve my results. Also google does not explain to newbie users at all how to effictively search - like using \"term\" to have the word term mandatory in search results or using a + between words to make sure both words are in the search results. It is crazy that a company that made their fortune via improving search (altervista was actually same quality but less marketed / pushed and abandoned after Yahoo! bought them) is so uninnovative when it comes to their core origin. Yahoo! also did not innovate at all, kept the cluttered directory style front page for years until people were fed up with it and collapsed. Google is much bigger but is on a downslope when it comes to innovation as well.\n\nYoutube is a circle jerk and tool for absolute scam artists to promote stupidity, here you also need to use plugins to block stupid channels to keep from getting stupid, just by watching the thumbnails. I recommend BlockTube for that purpose.\n\nOverall I can concur - yes the web has become mainstream and that brings along more stupid people and content, but there is ways around it to filter out the bs.",

That's what the TCF 2.0 is. Advertising consents are stored in a standardised format that the entire online advertising industry conforms to.\n\nBut we're not allowed cross-domain cookies any more, for stupid reasons.\n\nSo now each site has to set its own, and even multiple sites owned by the same network can't\\* share consent info.\n\n> so browsers can automatically set a cookie policy globally\n\n*Yes*, we *should* have this, instead of having to load the many hundreds of kilobytes of \"consent platform\" JS & associated assets on every pageview. Now that we do have, however, an industry built up of *paid-for* consent management JS bullshit, I very much doubt we'll be seeing the back of that any time soon, if ever. There's now a vested interest in keeping this horrific bullshit around.\n\nAs far as the titular assertion goes:\n\n> Cookie Consent leads to more tracking via cookies\n\nI don't believe this is the case. We only see opt-ins on our CMPs of 60-85%, and there's no way in hell 15-40% of visitors were ever clearing cookies manually with any frequency prior to all this crap.\n\n\\*Well, you *can*, depending on whether your CMP offers such a facility. The only (as far as I'm aware) decent free one left standing is QuantCast's, and they *do* allow cross-domain cookie preference setting, but I believe it's via passing data around their backend servers or some bollocks or other; too much hassle to properly investigate.",

Unfortunately consent management has become an industry and it might be hard to kill but every unneeded complexity is a problem! I guess one can hope :) \n\n\nMaybe users where not cleaning them manually but they could easily adjust their browser settings to automatically remove all cookies after some set time or on every close. Some browsers also have useful defaults. This increases the numbers of users deleting their cookies regularly (if not manually but somehow else) by a lot. Also a lot of people use private windows,.. I tended to use these a lot but am using them less and less because I am sick of popups or some wall on every request I make. But I can only speak for myself of course! Also other sites have higher opt ins Google/Youtube has a 100% since the site is not usable without consent ( not small banner at bottom but entire ‚Äûwall‚Äú) !",

They can give you feedback on why they did it that way and together you can come up with better ways to approach the problem.

If they submit a PR and it gets reviewed, and it's not immediately clear why it's better, then you can ask them why they chose to do it a certain way vs how you did it. That IS the discussion you're looking for. That IS collaboration. I guess I'm not sure what the problem is beyond you just being mad that someone thought that the code you wrote could be done differently for some reason that isn't entirely clear to you - at that point, if you harping on collaborating, then start a discussion asking what's better about their solution.",

Tracking this connection between the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address of a user would be considered personal identifyable information.\n\nAnother issue is that a users IP address can change as they are interacting with your website. What if they open your website while on a public hotspot, then move to mobile data as they lost connection. You now have an IP address inside your Google Tag Manager that is not found in your cookie consent logs.\n\nThis shows that IP addresses are not great identifiers for this\n\nYou need a token that identifies the user in both Google Tag Manager and your consent logs, while still preserving privacy",

It's been becoming an issue over time for me but I don't want to turn 'ranty' as I think most of you will share the frustration. I finally broke today because I I was browsing on my phone, then on my PC, and I've had enough. \n\nMore so because I've noticed a lot of the websites I've visited use the same consent platform, like OneTrust so I thought if I've rejected for one site using this consent platform why isn't there a way for OneTrust to remember my choice for all websites?\n\nFrom a users' perspective, do you know if there's a way to bypass, automatically dismiss or choose an option on cookie consent banners across multiple websites in a browsing session? \n\nFor context, I mostly use Chrome, Firefox and a mix of Windows, iOS & MacOS. I can handle my choice not being remembered across platforms, i.e. from mobile to desktop to laptop. But on one platform using the same browser, it'd be great if there was a way where I just wasn't prompted on every single website I visit when I'm researching something in a browser session.\n\nI've searched r/webdev and while there's a few things generally about cookie consent and people's opinions, I couldn't find anyone raising this point about the platforms themselves remembering the user's preference. The closest thing I've seen would be a browser setting but alas this isn't currently available on Chrome and Firefox to my knowledge.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Cookies are just a very tiny part of all that (only mentioned 3 times in the specs), but it became the bogeyman for the industry to focus on. The main issue in general is tracking. If this is done without using cookies, it still absolutely falls under the GDPR.\n\nAlso, these banners and modals look like they've been built either by AI or the most imcompetent developer that walked the planet. Some of the first iterations of these I saw would actually make dozens of external API calls to register you opting out (contrary to the very specific opt in behaviour the GDPR calls for) of specific groups of cookies. Those modals would take literal minutes to \"process\" your request, and most people would either leave the site or just accept everything (which conveniently was instant).\n\nThe state of play currently is a mess of unusable cookie modals, some of which require hundreds of individual clicks to fully opt out of everything (and yes, [I tested some sites and counted](https://www.ashleysheridan.co.uk/blog/Accessibility+Issues+With+Cookie+Banners) ). The result is something that is difficult for most people to use, and impossible for those people with specific accessibility needs. And a mistake I see pretty much every banner/modal make is to list the essential/functional cookies but as a readonly option that can't be changed. They're not part of tracking, they never needed to be listed or disabled, but somehow, they fell into the general misconception that GDPR = no cookies.\n\nAs the GDPR works through the various companies that violate specific sections of it, I reckon we'll see another change in how these modals are presented, but that's probably on a timescale of years.",

                "body": "Ah yes, GDPR making the internet less fun for all of us =)\n\nYou mentioning Google Analytics complicates matters slightly, but since your question also covers cookie consent in general I'll first tackle the general bits and address GA at the end.\n\nWhat you need to do is to actually prevent any type of cookie being set *before* the user has consented to allow them. Keep an eye on the *Cookies* section of the *Application* tab (when using Chrome's inspector panel), you'll be amazed how many third party cookies are set just from including scripts (or ifames, looking at you *youtube-nocookie* !).\n\nYou need to the following:\n\n**First:**\n\ndefer loading Analytics and any other third party script that might set cookies until consent is given. You need to do this client side using JS. So with pseudo code:\n\n**1** IF (on page load) / WHEN at runtime) cookie is set  \n**2** THEN load 3rd party scripts  \n**3** ELSE show consent popup\n\n**1** You can set an actual cookie (which you can read through *document.cookie* which brings the benefit that this cookie is also accessible to your backend, if you need this). ~~Otherwise you can just store a value inside local storage.~~ *< not true, see comment below*\n\n**2** This is where you create script elements and attach them do your *document.head.*\n\n**3** Show a modal window that you can make as obtrusive and unobtrusive as you like\n\nThis is where I can answer whether you want to use a 3rd party cookie banner or not:\n\n*It depends* : on what you want want the user experience to be like. If you deem the site unusable unless a user provides consent, this modal must be blocking the user from seeing content (at this point you need backend to only serve content to the browser when the user has accepted the cookie as users can otherwise circumvent any client side blocking you can think of).\n\nIf you want users to browse the site with reduced content, allow selecting which cookies they are willing to accept, or be a nice person and add a button allowing them to dismiss all cookies entirely. At this point you can store in session storage (which is not a persistent cookie) that the user does not want to be bothered with consent popups for the remainder of the session (e.g. until they close the browser).\n\nDon't reinvent the wheel when there is a ready to use solution, but be aware that in one form or another this solution needs to integrate with the requirements of your site.\n\nRolling your own solution might seem cumbersome but providing you have a clear idea of how to implement it, it might not be a hassle, for instance for my personal website I use Analytics and embed media content from YouTube. I allow users to view the site without consent which shows everything but shows placeholder content where the YT embed would be. If they click the placeholder I once more show the consent modal. Upon consent all third party content is embedded. The mechanism for this are just a few lines of JS to defer loading scripts. If you have this mechanism before creating the content views of your site, it's not really hard to maintain. Doing it retroactively... well that's a different story.\n\n**Secondly:**\n\nPer regulation, you need to list the cookies and what they are used for. Nobody reads this, but you need to have this section covered by law. You can create a link to a page from the consent popup and there you can list what every cookie is and what it is used for in a ginormous table. You can steal this text from any other site (because get this, they will be using it for the same purpose) or heck, ask Chat GPT to come up with something. :)\n\n**Third:**\n\nThe EU really, really doesn't like it when PII (personally identifiable information) is stored outside of EU data centers. Google Analytics stores its data in the US. You must set the *anonymize\\_ip* flag when configuring gtag (as an IP address is considered PII). <- *Sweden, Norway and a few other countries consider this still a breach though*\n\nAlso Google fonts. Download them and host them on your site (this is legal and you can download the fonts from Google fonts directly). Because loading the font from the Google CDN ... *stores PII in the US.* So once more: really, really check that inspector panel to understand what cookies are set just from visiting the pages of your site.",

We've had do not track and I forget the name for the new thing (global privacy), but those aren't sufficient for this since most people just use whatever the default is, so having either of those off doesn't imply cookie consent. Plus, they somewhat address a different thing since cookies aren't strictly for tracking.\n\nBut to add something a bit helpful - [the cookie store API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore) is a bit easier to work with than `document.cookie`. it's basically an async API with getters and setters that takes an object for options like expiration and such.

It's not a pattern I've personally come across before, but I think it's a better UX that is more respectful of our users.\n\n**We only request cookie consent at the point the user tried to do something that requires them.**\n\nOur approach is:\n\n* Don't set any cookies, and don't ask to either. No cookie/GDPR banner required.\n* Show the user features that would require cookies, anyway.\n* If the user attempts to interact with one of those features, *that's when* we ask for the cookies we need.\n* The consent dialog highlights the type of cookie required for the feature they tried to use, but also presents the other cookie options too. The user is here now, we can give them the option to enable/disable whichever cookies they want.\n* No dark patterns in the consent dialog. Two clear buttons, Allow or Cancel, neither is more prominent than the other.\n* If the user cancels, the feature they tried to use doesn't execute/doesn't do anything. If they grant the correct cookies, whatever they were trying to do goes ahead.\n* Having granted cookies, we now don't need to ask again. The user can now use that feature uninterrupted in the future. They'll see a new modal asking for more permissions if they try to use a feature that requires another class of consent.\n\n(Obviously, this doesn't help if you want cookies all the time, because you want to track users all the time. We use privacy-respecting, cookie-less analytics instead, and enhance this with additional cookie-dependent metrics if the user grants analytics cookies.)\n\nWhat do you think of the approach? Have you seen anything like this anywhere before?",

        "id": "1elfug2",
        "selftext": "(This should be a farily straightforward question, but I can't find straightforward answers to this after quite a bit of searching):\n\nWhat is every website that uses Google Analytics doing when if their users hit Reject or ignore the cookie consent altogether?\n\nAll the cookie-consent examples and boilerplates I find on the Internet seem to have Accept/Reject buttons where the Reject button does nothing.\n\nHowever, let's take the use-case of a website where cookies are necessary for it to work. Session cookies, yes I know those don't need consent. However, basics things like Google analytics and I guess even third-party login do.\n\nSo my question is, what happens if the user clicks Reject or ignores, and the website still loads analytics scripts? Is the webapp technically in non-compliance?\n\nIn that case, what is even the point of having Accept and Reject buttons? Isn't it better to just have an \"OK\" button and mention something like \"Don't use this website if you don't agree\" or so (similar to terms & conditions)?\n\nHOWEVER, I think the above is also not in GDPR compliance, with something like: \"...access to services and functionalities must not be made conditional on the consent of a user‚Ä¶ (so-called cookie walls)\" in the [guidelines](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf).\n\nSo in that case, I am wondering... what exactly do/should webapps do when a user rejects cookies? Just not load (say) analytics scripts? Wait for a cookie consent \"Accept\" before loading the script? How does this work with third-party logins (say Auth0)?\n\nAnd what should be the behavior if the user ignores the cookie consent altogeher, clicks neither Accept or Reject? Do you refrain from loading Google Analytics / Facebook pixel onto the page then? And in that case how does (should) third party login like auth0 work, if at all? (or are those exempt, being considered essential?)",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone\n\nI am developing a SaaS where, upon user registration or login, their login data such as email address and full name are stored in my Supabase database. Additionally, a cookie is established containing their Supabase auth ID and Supabase auth session. I've recently realized the need to include a cookie consent banner and a privacy policy in my SaaS. However, I am unsure about how strict these should be and where and how they should be implemented. Unfortunately, I cannot find the information I need through CHatGPT or Google.\n\nWhat sentences should I use in my cookie consent banner and privacy policy? How should I place the cookie consent banner and the privacy policy? One thing I understand is that a cookie consent banner can just be a banner appearing from the bottom of the web page. But what about privacy policy? And should I really give the users a posibility to reject all cookies? How can they even log in if they reject the cookies? I think having the \"Reject all\" will just prevent my users to use theapp basically.",

You are facing two challenges here, one the cookies and the other user data.\n\n**Cookies \\*nom nom nom\\***\n\nDetermine whether your cookies require consent. Different regions of the world have different rules (as per the data protection acts above, cater for the most strict act instead of creating separate, hard to manage, per region rules).\n\nA session cookie can be seen as a Strictly Necessary Cookie, which does not (necessarily) require consent.\n\n>And should I really give the users a posibility to reject all cookies\n\nIf its a Strictly Necessary Cookie, no, but if you plan to have 3rd party cookies that store data which can be related to an individual (such as analytics), then its good to get a generalised mechanism that allows you to provide the user with this option and subsequently a way for your SaaS to continue working without these cookies - and the features they should empower.\n\nYou could state clearly \"*You must accept cookies to use this product*\" and deny users any further access until they have consented, but often with a little bit of care you can provide your service just fine, even without reducing features.\n\n>How can they even log in if they reject the cookies?\n\nIf your SaaS is an SPA you can store the authentication token in memory on the client. You can send this token on each service request (as part of the payload or request header). It does mean that upon each visit (where the page is loaded freshly) the client needs to login again, but your navigation should in this case just navigate within the SPA routing, meaning this ideally never happens. You could also keep it in SessionStorage so that the login is valid for as long as the browser isn't closed (but this comes with a potential security risk on shared computers).\n\nThe privacy policy should list what each cookie is used for in the context of making your application work. There is no real legalese language you need here, just providing transparency. You can find plenty of templates for this type of text, even per service/feature you're describing.\n\n**User data**\n\nCertain acts, such as GDPR make it mandatory to allow a user to access al their data and also view and delete it. As such users should be able to delete their accounts, but also all data generated under that account from your platform.",

And question is if this is enough. I can see that gtm is providing cookie consent banner on the website, you can allow or denie Marketing/Analytic cookies, but there is no cookie table. If its possible i dont want to use CMP, but if its realy necessery, could you recommend something? The best would be open source or free, which doesnt have realy low limits. \n\nThanks for any help in advance!",

When people accept it, then `sessionStorage.setItem` sets the value to \"ok\", and it's possible to browse the website without the pop up.\n\nI decided to go with `sessionStorage` because it wouldn't be persistent after people stop browsing the website: just by closing the tab it will start over next time. But if people open the links in a new tab the pop up will appear again, needing the consent, of course, since I used `sessionStorage`.\n\nI decided to try `localStorage` instead, and the consent is valid for all tabs now, but I still want the consent to be gone when all the tabs or the browser window are closed. So I tried to add the windows event listener \"beforeunload\" (still don't know if should be \"unload\" instead) and make it clear the consent with `localStorage.removeItem`, and now people can browse the website in multiple tabs and restart the consent over after the window is closed, but there is an issue: if one of the opened tabs viewing the website is closed, then the consent is reset in the other tabs, since it's the local storage.\n\nWhat would be the best approach? Did I make the right decision when using `sessionStorage` or `localStorage`? I mean: what are the possible approaches in doing it? Do people use cookies for the cookie consent?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nP.S.: Should I use `localStorage` with a timestamp as the value? If some specific time had passed, the key would be cleared and the pop up would appear. Is it OK to keep the consent choice after people leave the website? What would be a proper time difference?",

OneTrust also has a great privacy policy tool that acts as a headless CMS, and allows you to give you legal department user profiles to draft and publish changes to the privacy policy without having access to the site itself.

There's an accceptable margin of error and you're still comparing apples to apples, that error is always present and constantly in the context of the numbers we're looking at.

Sessions are stored as  some cache memory and only live for a pre-determined time. E.G. 20  minutes in Redis or some Session store. How the server knows a session  is active is some cookie or local storage that sends a hash back to the  server.

Sessions are stored as some cache memory and only live for a pre-determined time, e.g. 20 minutes in Redis or some Session store. How the server knows a session is active is some cookie or local storage that sends a hash back to the  server. Once the server checks for the hash, it will see it does not exist in the cache and terminate the session. Maybe you are thinking of something else.\n\n**First, I notice that they** ***seem*** **to have a rather different understanding of the word \"session\" than what I indicated in my earlier writings**‚Äîthey appear to use it to mean \"a state of connection, at least *de jure*, between the computer and the web server\" (which will henceforth be referred to as a session *sensu Hosnium*‚Ä†), when I used it to mean \"the data making up the content of the pages themselves, including that which was inputted by the user\" (which will henceforth be referred to as a session *sensu Grandis*‚Ä†).\n\n**In particular, they seem to be implying that the presence of the latter is dependent on the former, which doesn't seem true to any real extent.** I mean, if that ***were*** true, sessions *sensu Grandis* probably wouldn't survive if a computer loses internet connection or is put to sleep for any real length of time, which they *fairly obviously do*‚ÄîI have sometimes had my laptop disconnected from the internet for more than 2 days, or closed and asleep for over a week, and its not like every single page refreshes after contact is restored (the session *sensu Grandis* ending during a communication interruption itself would be almost oxymoronic, unless the local hash program contained a script to do that if it detected a communications outage... which would be in most cases one of the most needlessly cruel UX decisions I can think of). In fact, most pages still remain perfectly functional afterwards, including me being able to interact with content and submit content that I had been working on, demonstrating either that sessions *sensu Hosnium* are much less ephemeral than they think, and/or that the maintenance of a continuous session *sensu Hosnium* is far less important to web functionality than they think, with many sites able to accept an interruption and still accept user input (including often offline input) after that interruption has passed.\n\nFurthermore, even if the retention of sessions *sensu Hosnium* was extremely important, it would still be very possible to retain that hash program for it to be constantly running in the background so you could keep a \"zombie session\" going after a tab/window has nominally been closed, and store it on the hard drive to run immediately after boot so you could return to the same session if your computer restarted over less than 20 minutes or so. It should even be possible, if more difficult, to create a VPN-like server that would spoof as your IP address and run the hash program so that your sessions remain active even if your computer is incommunicado for a very long period of time. And even if we lived in a fantasy world where malicious scripts triggered the termination of a session *sensu Grandis* with the interruption of a session *sensu Hosnium*, I don't see why it wouldn't be possible for your computer to reject said script and store a copy of the contents of the current pages (including input information) on the hard drive to, at the very least, serve as an archive and something to copy from before you need to refresh it in order to continue interacting with the webpage in a manner the server recognizes. (Or, to continue the morbid analogy I used in the impetus post, the frozen corpse of a webpage rather than a taxidermized one.)\n\n**So,** ***what is the truth?*** **Is my counterargument to his points sensical? And if what I am looking for is possible,** ***are there any implementations of it?***\n\n‚Ä†Why yes, I realize I am probably mutilating Latin. Not as badly as all the web browsers I've seen mutilate the web pages they \"restore\", however, which is generally to total unrecognizability beyond the most superficial details (that being the *initial* URL, title, and favicon).\n\n(I am also posting this on r/AskProgramming, for good measure.)",

The EU Cookie Law isn't a single, uniform law. Guidelines were created, but it was left up to each member state to come up with their own law, following the guidelines. This potentially means that the French law governing cookies is different from the Spanish law, which is different from the German law, and so on. German case law has already had an impact on the overall guidelines, and the potential for change exists.\n\nHere's a brief writeup on this: [https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/digital-law/what-do-eu-cookie-laws-mean-for-you/](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/digital-law/what-do-eu-cookie-laws-mean-for-you/)",

        "selftext": "Hi - so I am working on a ground up redesign of a corporation's global network of sites. Each region has slightly different content needs so, while they all use the same template and code base, they are separate sites with separate domains and are managed by separate marketing teams.\n\nAs the majority of these sites are located in the EU we need to provide a robust cookie consent management solution. Specifically, their legal team has requested that we provide the ability for users to enable/disable different categories of cookies ( i.e. performance/advertising/social/etc ). Additionally they require a cookie statement page with detailed information about each cookie - it's purpose, source, expiration, etc.\n\nUnfortunately I've run into an issue where all of the existing hosted cookie consent solutions I have tested so far either don't support the desired user experience or don't support all of the languages we need.\n\nI've also considered implementing this from scratch on our own but it's very daunting. We only have a few first party cookies on the site and I can add a consent layer, categorize, and provide translation capability for those without too much trouble.\n\nHowever, the client uses Google Tag Manager (GTM) to handle third party scripts and each region is likely to use a separate selection of scripts. I've done a bit of research on how one might categorize and block these scripts and most articles I have read involve making extensive customizations within your GTM configuration. Everything about this sounds hellish to maintain when we consider that we'd be having to account for more than a dozen separate marketing teams each with their own GTM accounts.\n\nSo, unless I'm missing some easy way to interact with cookies added by GTM programmatically ( entirely possible ) it seems like using an existing SAAS solution is the way to go.\n\nDoes anyone have a recommendation for a solution that meets all of these requirements?\n\n* adheres to strict GDPR requirements\n* allows blocking cookies by category ( performance, advertising, etc )\n* capable of generating a cookie statement with detailed information about each cookie ( source, duration, purpose, etc )\n* supports the following languages - English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese\n* ALTERNATIVELY supports overriding of any text ( includes button text )\n\nIf anyone has a recommendation or can at least point me in a good direction I will be incredibly grateful!",

The purpose is to protect your privacy. All those cookie notifications are not caused by GDPR, but are caused by the ‚Äúhunger for data‚Äù by companies. There are solutions available to collect usage statistics without violating GDPR, but companies opt to continue to use tooling like Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager. GDPR is not solely about storing information, it is about (storing) information that can identify you as a visitor based on that stored information.\n\nAs long as websites ask me to consent to sharing my data with more than 100 partners, I have a hard time blaming GDPR for the reduced user experience to be honest.\n\nPS.

The user must actively perform some kind of positive indication of informed consent, and just ignoring a chunk of text is not that.\n\nThis means, then, that a small banner simply won't do the trick: users will just ignore it and keep browsing around it, and you still can't track them because they have not agreed. And you can't deny them access either, because (see above) that's not allowed. Likewise, a dismissable banner is worthless, because dismissing does not imply consent, even if (see above) the banner has text in it saying \"by continuing, you agree...\". So if you're set on getting people to allow tracking, you have to be rather obnoxious about it - as obnoxious as you can be without stepping into outright illegality. Blocking access entirely is not allowed, but a large banner that covers all the interesting stuff and has a nice inviting green \"accept all\" button, and a pale transparent \"customize\" button that takes you to a large complex page with lots of frightful semi-legalese explanations and sixty switches that you need to turn off one by one as you scroll down 12 screenfuls of dread, that's borderline acceptable, and seems to be considered the current sweet spot.",

No, we could not have deemed it an \"essential cookie\", because technically the product would function without it.\n\nDue to the complexity of GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy acts it's usually safer to always include the banner and explicitly ask for permission to log anything, and then apply scaling factors on the data provided based on estimates of how many people rejected all cookies.",

A validated email address is far more valuable.\n\nIf you want to actually get conversions & sales from email, then you need good inbox visibility to start with. This means maintaining your sending reputation. Email validation is a form of email engagement which is a +ve sender reputation signal.\n\nThis is a pretty well developed practice in (real) email Marketing Automation. Having a bunch of disengaged email recipients compounds -ve reputation signals over time and  makes sends successively less visible to the *engaged* recipients. Less engaged recipients seeing your email => less clicks => fewer conversions.\n\nBasically you stand to gain more by having a smaller, verified & active list from compounding +ve reputation signals helping to boost inboxing/visibility and email ROI over time.\n\nThe best content I know of here is by Mike Arsenault who used to do marketing at webflow.\n\nVid here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxfivFmOPAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxfivFmOPAE)  \nBlog here: [http://rejoiner.com/resources/email-deliverability/](http://rejoiner.com/resources/email-deliverability/)\n\n\\^ not associated with this guy or brand, but the email team at work does use Rejoiner as an ESP",

What the GDPR does is clarify the terms of consent, requiring organizations to ask for an affirmative opt-in to be able to send communications. And you must also make it easy for people to change their mind and opt-out. Only if a marketing email does not present the option to unsubscribe, is sent to someone who never signed up for it, or does not advertise a service related to one the receiver uses is it violating the GDPR.\n\nIt does not necessarily force you to use *double* opt-in. It just makes sure that your customer has given her consent ‚Äúfreely [...], specific, informed and unambiguous.‚Äù\n\nDo you know any other method to give informed consent other than a double opt-in?\n\nEDIT: An example is if you happen to have the customer on the phone anyway and ask them for consent to be included in the Newsletter.

However, users must still be informed about their use in a cookie policy or privacy policy.\n2. **Analytics Without Cookies**: If you gather analytics server-side without setting additional cookies, this avoids the need for consent typically associated with analytics cookies. However, GDPR still requires you to:\n   * Be transparent about data collection (e.g., in your privacy policy).\n   * Justify the data processing under a lawful basis such as **legitimate interest**.\n   * Minimize data collection to what is necessary for your stated purpose.\n3. **A/B Testing**: Tracking A/B testing versions via session cookies can qualify as strictly necessary if it is essential for delivering the service users expect (e.g., ensuring they see a consistent version of your site during a visit).\n\n# CCPA Considerations\n\n1. **Session Cookies and Analytics**: Under CCPA, session cookies used for functionality or analytics collected directly by you (not involving third-party tools) are typically not considered a sale of data. However, you must:\n   * Disclose that you collect analytics data in your privacy policy.\n   * Provide a mechanism for users to opt out of data collection if the data is considered personal information.\n2. **A/B Testing**: Similar to GDPR, if the data collected is necessary for providing the service (e.g., ensuring users experience the same A/B testing variant), it is unlikely to trigger additional obligations. Still, you should disclose it transparently.\n\n# Do You Need a Cookie Banner?\n\n* **No Cookie Banner Required**: If the cookies used are strictly necessary, and no analytics or tracking cookies are set, a cookie banner is not required under GDPR.\n* **Transparency Required**: Both GDPR and CCPA require you to explain in your privacy policy:\n   * The types of data collected (e.g., analytics data, session tracking).\n   * The purposes for which the data is processed.\n   * Users' rights (e.g., access, deletion, or opting out under CCPA).\n\n# Key Steps to Ensure Compliance\n\n1. **Privacy Policy**: Clearly state:\n   * What data is collected (e.g., session cookies, analytics data).\n   * Why it is collected and how it is used (e.g., A/B testing, site functionality).\n   * User rights (opt-out under CCPA, access, or deletion).\n2. **Avoid Non-Essential Cookies**: If you don‚Äôt use cookies for analytics or third-party tracking, this simplifies compliance significantly.\n3. **Lawful Basis**: For GDPR, rely on a lawful basis like legitimate interest for server-side analytics and strictly necessary cookies.\n\nBy sticking to these practices, you avoid the need for a cookie banner while still meeting the transparency and accountability obligations under GDPR and CCPA.",

Hope I can shine a little more light here. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything further.\n\n>Essential Cookies: Cookies used solely to maintain sessions and ensure functionality (like tracking A/B testing variations)I believe ChatGPT is giving you an incorrect definition of essential cookies here. \n\nUnless I'm misunderstanding your product, if you turn off tracking A/B testing, ***the site will still work and the user experience during that session wouldn't be impinged.*** If so, these are not essential cookies; they would rather fall under persistent cookies (aka tracking cookies). These absolutely do require informed consent, and you would need a cookie banner for this. \n\nIn general, essential cookies tend to do things like keeping someone signed in during the session or retaining their language choices. The two rules of thumb I follow are:\n\n* if the cookie doesn't expire at the end of the session, i.e. there is data left over after a person finishes a session, it's likely not essential to the session. You'll need consent.\n* If the cookie is not there to enable the user to use your site, it's not essential to the user, it's just important to you. You'll need consent.\n\n>I also don't understand the consequences of not following those laws if I'm not in California or Europe, so I'd like to understand this and make sure I am compliant without doing needless feature work.\n\nSo, it's actually not about where you are; the laws aren't protecting you, they're protecting the citizens of their region.\n\n* If you collect personal data from a citizen of the EU, you'll need to follow the rules set by the GDPR.\n* If you collect personal data from US citizens in California, you'll need to follow the CCPA / CPRA.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcing fines, that's when things become a little more technical and you'll have to do your own reading. But your service could absolutely be banned in the EU, and in my opinion that risk isn't worthwhile when compliance softwares tend to be barely a few dollars a month and, in some cases, offer lifetime licenses. \n\n>It is also my understanding that sites that prompt those annoying cookie banners aren't really complying with the law.\n\nNot exactly - if you see a site with a cookie banner, it just means they're using non-essential cookies and requesting your consent to use them. By having the banner - assuming the banner is actually compliant and blocks scripts automatically - they are simply doing their best to comply with the law.\n\nEnd of the day, your product is a tracking software and your service is now highly regulated. But it's still incredibly useful, and you'll find more than 50% of people still consent to cookies anyway. As a marketer by trade, your product looks to be in the best interest of the internet and user experience - keep at it, just don't ignore compliance(!\n\nHope this helps :)\n\nAlistair",

        "author": "KvetoslavNovak",
        "id": "1k7d88b",
        "selftext": "On Apr 23, 2025 the European Commission found that Apple breached its anti-steering obligation under the Digital Markets Act [https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text](https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text) (DMA), and that Meta breached the DMA obligation to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data.\n\nTherefore, the Commission has fined Apple and Meta with ‚Ç¨500 million and ‚Ç¨200 million respectively.\n\n**## Non-compliance decision on Apple's steering terms**\n\nUnder the DMA, **app developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able to inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store**, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases.\n\nThis duty of the gatekeeper to allow developers to link users to alternative purchase options outside the gatekeeper's platform is set out in Article 5(4) of the DMA [https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text#Article-5-Obligations-for-gatekeepers](https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text#Article-5-Obligations-for-gatekeepers)\n\nThe Commission found that Apple fails to comply with this obligation. Due to a number of restrictions imposed by Apple, **app developers cannot fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels** outside the App Store.\n\nSimilarly, consumers cannot fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers.\n\n**## Non-compliance decision on Meta's ‚Äúconsent or pay‚Äù model**\n\nUnder the DMA, gatekeepers must seek users' consent for combining their personal data between services. Those users who do not consent must have access to a less personalised but equivalent alternative.\n\nIn November 2023, Meta introduced a binary \\_Consent or Pay\\_ advertising model. Under this model, EU users of Facebook and Instagram had a choice between consenting to personal data combination for personalised advertising or **paying a monthly subscription for an ad-free service**.\n\nThe Commission found that this model is not compliant with the DMA, as it did not give users the required specific choice to opt for a service that uses less of their personal data but is otherwise equivalent to the ‚Äòpersonalised ads' service. **Meta's model also did not allow users to exercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data**.\n\nThe duty of the gatekeeper to provide users with a less personalized but equivalent alternative if they refuse data processing consent is set out in Article 5(2) of the DMA [https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text#Article-5-Obligations-for-gatekeepers](https://www.eurlexa.com/act/en/32022R1925/present/text#Article-5-Obligations-for-gatekeepers)\n\n  \nSource: [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip\\_25\\_1085](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085)",

To this day, just installing Ruby on Rails and hoping it will work is a stressful experience for me, although I know there's probably easier ways to do it now like with Docker containers.\n\nI generally prefer to follow SOLID principles whenever possible, and PHP 8 and Laravel 7/8 really seem to encourage it out of the box.

On the other side of the isle you get people who think PHP is this just great language with no issues and everyone who criticizes are silly bcs \"8.1 features 111!!!1!\" and so on. But I have to say I prefer the later more than the former.\n\nNo, it's not bad practice at all. PHP is very fast to develop and prototype language. Which can also scale well as it's less language dependent than many beginners think, however you run into an issue or two which are language specific down the line occasionally.\n\nThat being said, it's important to recognize that often you do not need that \"scale\". And wasting your time to make something \"scalable\" when there is absolute no requirement on the horizons to make it so is a mark of a inexperienced programmer.\n\nAs to repeat what other people already said answering your question about lack of security, there is nothing innately insecure about php. At least not more than any other popular language. Insecurities are generally result of poorly written code, not the language itself. PHP due to how easy is to use the language was often used by people who did not know a lot of stuff about security measures in terms of code one has to make, couple that with amount of php websites on the internet and that's how insecurity got associated with php. That being said, you can have absolutely the same issues with Java, Python or whatever.\n\nMy point: your usage of PHP is fine. It solves the problem. Move on. Your class mate is an idiot.",

And this for a mix of reasons, including facility of handling the basics (on webmaster side. On dev side it's rather hellish to dive into, at least until you get core notions), very strong reputation, active development, being of a strong quality code (although there are still areas that would warrant some slaps in the face) and \"being designed as a framework even before a CMS\" so you can tailor it to custom use-cases from both sides.\n\nIn 5 years though it may be in the top 10 at the very best, considering how fast and wide other products progress...",

People trying to perpetuate the reputation of \"bad language\" either have lived below earthcrust for the last 15 years or are simply illiterate.\n\nALthough there \\*are\\* a few technicalities or designs that are harder to create in PHP than, say, in Java, notably because it's still an interpreted and not compiled language (I'm especially thinking about true polymorphism), you have today largely enough \"modern language\" features, low level libraries and tools to build quality apps.\n\nNever forget that whatever good or bad a language may be, the only real mattering factor in app's end quality is the mind and effort put into developing it.\n\nAlso, fortunately, most concepts and patterns you'll learn or discover in PHP are perfectly portable in other languages. So for now if you have managed to muster a \"learning dynamic\" in PHP drop any unfounded fear of \"having made a bad choice\" and dig deeper and deeper. ;)\n\nYou'll have ample time to start initiating yourself to other languages once you are comfortable enough in PHP that when you start studying a language you only have to \"get\" its own quirks and possibly specific concepts but all the basics (object, inheritance, typical patterns like observer / event, code writing methodology and best practices) have become natural to you.\n\nGood luck in exploring the exciting world of \"functional creation\", and good work!",

Using PHP does not appear to be an obvious competitive disadvantage.\n\n__However__.\n\nPHP is loathed. That means it is difficult to find motivated programmers who use PHP (or rather, you'll find plenty of programmers, but a large share will be less capable and less willing to learn new things or go out on a limb). Simply because of a self perpetuating cycle: PHP sucks, why? Because everybody knows it sucks and therefore everybody who uses PHP just isn't in tune or doesn't care.\n\nLanguages are a product of their community. No language stands alone. PHP (or Java, or Python, or Haskell, or Brainfuck) is no better than the community: If those answering questions (here, stackoverflow, etc) aren't very bright or motivated, that makes it harder to learn the language. If the libraries don't exist, have bad API, or are riddled with bugs, that's a problem. Hence why it's a self perpetuating prophecy.\n\nSo how bad is it in the PHP world? Not horrible, but it's definitely picking up some drag and I really, really doubt it'll get better. Languages like java do well despite common complaints, but PHP really does seem to be losing its edge.\n\nFor what it is worth:\n\n* PHP was just badly designed. It exudes incompetence everywhere. For example, its built-in function names are _wildly_ inconsistent, using underscores seemingly arbitrarily and using different synonyms. There's actually a really stupid reason for that: The original versions would hash function lookups on string length so the original designers went out of their way to make functions have a nice distribution of name length. Which is an epically stupid way to name functions, of course. This is one of a very, _very_ long list of dubious design decisions. The problem is, __all__ languages have that list, and for all languages it's a sizable list. But I'm pretty sure PHP's list is many times longer than just about any other mainstream language. See also [PHP is a fractal of bad design](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/), but note that there have been rebuttals and revisits, which may be worth a read.\n* PHP used to have a bunch of baked in advantages but all of those have gone. It must compete now just on community and language design (and I fear for both of those). In the past, the vaunted 'LAMP stack' (Linux + Apache webserver + MySQL db + PHP) was __incredibly__ cheap to find a hoster for, in very sharp contrast to just about anything else which required literally 20x or more monthly (as you could get virtual LAMP stacks, where you shared space with many others on a single server, but few hosters would let you pull that stunt for anything else, and paying for an entire server was expensive. These days, you get the entire linux server with root access as a virtual IAAS appliance for 5 bucks a month or whatnot. PHP is no longer 'cheap'). Also, the PHP model, crazy as it was, enforces that you shove ALL your state in a database, but that does actually let you scale it better. Of course, you can do that (store all state in db) in _any_ language, and these days, other languages have web frameworks that support that model, so that advantage has turned into the handcuffs that they always were.\n\nYour friend is an ass, but you should probably still be thinking 'when shall I learn a different language?'.

In the app roles I added my Instagram test users, and then went to \"API setup with Instagram business login\" and generated tokens then placed them in my testing app. I used to generate my access tokens (for the test users) from the oauth endpoint but now didn't need to do that as Instagram test users allow all scopes.

Thats just good contract hygiene. \n\nHaving said the above, I don't think it would be considered reasonable for you to know the ins and outs of regulatory compliance issues. GDPR aside, security is a shared responsibility. As a contract developer you should have a set of security best practices you follow. At least within the scope and limitations of your work, and have it included in your scope of work so the bounds are known.\n\nIf nothing in the agreement to define security scope, I would think you must negotiate and determine what you believe is reasonable. Take it as a lesson learned for next time.\n\nPersonally if I was going to do contract work, I would have a boilerplate agreement drafted, even if clients typically have their own, so I can redline with my own clauses should theirs not adequately meet my standard concerns. \n\nTake a look at something like AWS security controls. They are comprehensive and cleanly map into all the major industry and government compliance laws. Capture those controls that you reasonably believe would impact your typical scope of work.",

        "author": "trolleid",
        "id": "1k4ng09",
        "selftext": "So I was reading about OAuth to learn it and have created this explanation. It's basically a few of the best I have found merged together and rewritten in big parts. I have also added a super short summary and a code example. Maybe it helps one of you :-) Here is the [repo][ref-repo].\n\n# OAuth Explained\n\n## The Basic Idea\n\nLet‚Äôs say LinkedIn wants to let users import their Google contacts.\n\nOne obvious (but terrible) option would be to just ask users to enter their Gmail email and password directly into LinkedIn. But giving away your actual login credentials to another app is a huge security risk.\n\nOAuth was designed to solve exactly this kind of problem.\n\nNote: So OAuth solves an authorization problem! Not an authentication problem. See [here][ref1] for the difference.\n\n## Super Short Summary\n\n- User clicks ‚ÄúImport Google Contacts‚Äù on LinkedIn\n- LinkedIn redirects user to Google‚Äôs OAuth consent page\n- User logs in and approves access\n- Google redirects back to LinkedIn with a one-time code\n- LinkedIn uses that code to get an access token from Google\n- LinkedIn uses the access token to call Google‚Äôs API and fetch contacts\n\n## More Detailed Summary\n\nSuppose LinkedIn wants to import a user‚Äôs contacts from their Google account.\n\n1. LinkedIn sets up a Google API account and receives a client_id and a client_secret\n   - So Google knows this client id is LinkedIn\n2. A user visits LinkedIn and clicks \"Import Google Contacts\"\n3. LinkedIn redirects the user to Google‚Äôs authorization endpoint:\n   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=12345&redirect_uri=https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback&scope=contacts\n\n- client_id is the before mentioned client id, so Google knows it's LinkedIn\n- redirect_uri is very important. It's used in step 6\n- in scope LinkedIn tells Google how much it wants to have access to, in this case the contacts of the user\n\n4. The user will have to log in at Google\n5. Google displays a consent screen: \"LinkedIn wants to access your Google contacts. Allow?\" The user clicks \"Allow\"\n6. Google generates a one-time authorization code and redirects to the URI we specified: redirect_uri. **It appends the one-time code as a URL parameter**.\n   - So the URL could be https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback?code=one_time_code_xyz\n7. Now, LinkedIn makes a server-to-server request (not a redirect) to Google‚Äôs token endpoint and receive an access token (and ideally a refresh token)\n8. **Finished**. Now LinkedIn can use this access token to access the user‚Äôs Google contacts via Google‚Äôs API\n\n---\n\n**Question:**\n_Why not just send the access token in step 6?_\n\n**Answer:** To make sure that the requester is actually LinkedIn. So far, all requests to Google have come from the user‚Äôs browser, with only the client_id identifying LinkedIn. Since the client_id isn‚Äôt secret and could be guessed by an attacker, Google can‚Äôt know for sure that it's actually LinkedIn behind this. In the next step, LinkedIn proves its identity by including the client_secret in a server-to-server request.\n\n## Security Note: Encryption\n\nOAuth 2.0 does **not** handle encryption itself. It relies on HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to secure sensitive data like the client_secret and access tokens during transmission.\n\n## Security Addendum: The state Parameter\n\nThe state parameter is critical to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. It‚Äôs a unique, random value generated by the third-party app (e.g., LinkedIn) and included in the authorization request. Google returns it unchanged in the callback. LinkedIn verifies the state matches the original to ensure the request came from the user, not an attacker.\n\n## OAuth 1.0 vs OAuth 2.0 Addendum:\n\nOAuth 1.0 required clients to cryptographically sign every request, which was more secure but also much more complicated. OAuth 2.0 made things simpler by relying on HTTPS to protect data in transit, and using bearer tokens instead of signed requests.\n\n## Code Example: OAuth 2.0 Login Implementation\n\nBelow is a standalone Node.js example using Express to handle OAuth 2.0 login with Google, storing user data in a SQLite database.\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst axios = require(\"axios\");\nconst sqlite3 = require(\"sqlite3\").verbose();\nconst crypto = require(\"crypto\");\nconst jwt = require(\"jsonwebtoken\");\nconst jwksClient = require(\"jwks-rsa\");\n\nconst app = express();\nconst db = new sqlite3.Database(\":memory:\");\n\n// Initialize database\ndb.serialize(() => {\n  db.run(\n    \"CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, email TEXT)\"\n  );\n  db.run(\n    \"CREATE TABLE federated_credentials (user_id INTEGER, provider TEXT, subject TEXT, PRIMARY KEY (provider, subject))\"\n  );\n});\n\n// Configuration\nconst CLIENT_ID = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID;\nconst CLIENT_SECRET = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET;\nconst REDIRECT_URI = \"https://example.com/oauth2/callback\";\nconst SCOPE = \"openid profile email\";\n\n// JWKS client to fetch Google's public keys\nconst jwks = jwksClient({\n  jwksUri: \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs\",\n});\n\n// Function to verify JWT\nasync function verifyIdToken(idToken) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    jwt.verify(\n      idToken,\n      (header, callback) => {\n        jwks.getSigningKey(header.kid, (err, key) => {\n          callback(null, key.getPublicKey());\n        });\n      },\n      {\n        audience: CLIENT_ID,\n        issuer: \"https://accounts.google.com\",\n      },\n      (err, decoded) => {\n        if (err) return reject(err);\n        resolve(decoded);\n      }\n    );\n  });\n}\n\n// Generate a random state for CSRF protection\napp.get(\"/login\", (req, res) => {\n  const state = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString(\"hex\");\n  req.session.state = state; // Store state in session\n  const authUrl = `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}&scope=${SCOPE}&response_type=code&state=${state}`;\n  res.redirect(authUrl);\n});\n\n// OAuth callback\napp.get(\"/oauth2/callback\", async (req, res) => {\n  const { code, state } = req.query;\n\n  // Verify state to prevent CSRF\n  if (state !== req.session.state) {\n    return res.status(403).send(\"Invalid state parameter\");\n  }\n\n  try {\n    // Exchange code for tokens\n    const tokenResponse = await axios.post(\n      \"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\",\n      {\n        code,\n        client_id: CLIENT_ID,\n        client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,\n        redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI,\n        grant_type: \"authorization_code\",\n      }\n    );\n\n    const { id_token } = tokenResponse.data;\n\n    // Verify ID token (JWT)\n    const decoded = await verifyIdToken(id_token);\n    const { sub: subject, name, email } = decoded;\n\n    // Check if user exists in federated_credentials\n    db.get(\n      \"SELECT * FROM federated_credentials WHERE provider = ?

        "author": "the_earl_man",
        "id": "1aiol65",
        "selftext": "edit 2/5/2024:\n\nMy sites are back online, so all is good now. My guess is that somebody at Netlify found this thread.\n\nA couple things to clarify: Netlify had every right to take down my sites after my bill went unpaid. That's not the issue. Telling me that I have to find a new service due to a phishing scam that I had no knowledge of, without allowing me to take any steps to fix it‚Äîthat's the issue. (idk why I'm even saying this... the commentors who half-read my post aren't gonna bother reading this anyway)\n\nThat phishing domain, btw, was nowhere to be found on my account once I had access again.\n\nIf I had a client that paid me regularly for 12 months and paid late on the 13th month, I would undoubtedly give them some leeway. Most humans are like this.\n\n**Here's my best guess as to what happened:** \n\nThere were 3 issues 1) there was an unrelated api error since I had changed my email on Github, linked to my account 2) there was the unpaid bill 3) the domains had broke (still not sure why). \n\nMy guess is that the support team member was overwhelmed with all the issues and did the expedient thing, which was telling me to find a new service (not unreasonable imo), and hoped the issue would go away.\n\nI didn't go away, so she brought my ticket it to a supervisor or something. He couldn't figure out the issue, so he gave me a false reason for why my account was disabled. It's fixed now, though. Thanks Hrishikesh!\n\n  \n\\---  \nI've been using  Netlify for client sites for the last 6 years.  I had about 20 sites  published on there, 8 were for clients.\n\nA  few weeks ago I received notice that I hadn't paid for my subscription  (my life was a bit hectic with moving homes and holiday season, so I  didn't notice that one of my bank accounts had gone into the red).  Because of that, Netlify had taken down some of my sites.\n\nAfter  a few weeks, I took care of the unpaid bill (definitely too long, I  know). I waited about 12 hours and contacted support to check up on it.  Several hours later they told me the sites were up.\n\nOne site was back up, but the rest weren't.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qk1kpo13skgc1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ffe1f66b1c051f17bbba70fcb4bcd77e2664d6e\n\nOn top of that, there was another issue - I couldn't log in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ffdi8eh4skgc1.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=180a11e056257464d303c2ecafb68839890f1ecf\n\n24 hours later, support sent me this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqgeloi5skgc1.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c3fb55f8c74515fed22a1d903024424c9536\n\nI've been an independent web  developer for 4 years now, and with how saturated the market is, clients  are quick to find other options for getting their website built.  Thankfully, I'm not currently dependent on this income, but the trust  I've with my current clients has definitely been damaged.\n\nI asked for further information and received:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7p3nu6t6skgc1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8d1bda14e3166f4a9922c60b12d7413ca10041c\n\nI'm entirely unfamiliar with the  website under question. I didn't receive any notice of the complaint  until after they disabled my account, and it's super frustrating that  rather than letting me do something about it, Netlify kicked me off the  platform entirely. like *I didn't even know*\n\nI  suspect that the account got hacked, or I unwisely signed up for some  AI site generator that was compromised and published a site without my  knowledge/consent, but it's so annoying that a service I've vouched for  for 4 years dropped me without warning\n\nI'm  going to look for another service now, obviously. Hopefully, it's not  too much of a headache to get my domains transferred. I just wanted to  get the story out so that people are aware. If y'all have any  suggestions for an alternative web host, lmk. Cloudflare Pages looks  pretty interesting right now.",

If you suspect the AI site generator caused this, there are a few questions.\n\nWhy aren‚Äôt your business accounts separate from personal? That‚Äôs a big red flag and poor move on your part for someone with 4 years of experience. If my personal information gets compromised, my clients shouldn‚Äôt be as well.\n\nIf you were using the AI generator on your business accounts which lead to compromise, were you trying to generate your clients sites with AI? Why play with fly by night AI generators on a business account? Poor form, those AI site generators are not that great and could be putting malicious code into your site.\n\nYour trust has been damaged and it‚Äôs not on netlify.",

I don't blame them, as misinformation and FUD is everywhere!\n\n-\n\nThis is mostly wrong.\n\nThe GPDR and EU rules relate to storing and handling personally identifiable information: Information which can be used to identify you and connect you with your actions. Wether it's stored in a cookie or not is immaterial.\n\nIf the information is required to do what the person has directly required of you (i.e. they order an item on your web shop and leave behind their name and address), then you are in the green. No extra consent or legalese required. The same of course applies to information you are legally required to store.\n\nif the information is not directly required to do something the person has asked of you, but is required to do something which is beneficial to the person identified, then you might be in the green - but have to write up a text stating your reasoning.  That reasoning can be tested in court. I.e. tracking errors in your app can be reasonably argued to be allowed, as it benefits users. Access logs can also be seen as OK, depending on what they are used for. You should probably also take some measures to make sure that the storage and handling is proportional to the benefit, like anonymising logs after 30 days.\n\nIn all other cases you have to ask for explicit consent. Here  \\_all marketing and retargeting is explicitly included\\_, so that you always have to ask for explicit consent before you store someones personal information to target ads to them or resell that information. Thus a \"cookie banner\" or \"consent screen\".",

The defaults are still being treated as denied.\n\nQuestions:\nHas anyone else seen HubSpot CMP override Consent Mode values after interaction?\nHow can I stop consent states from being overwritten when a user accepts?\nIs there a recommended way to intercept or preserve the values during/after banner interaction?\nCould this be a sequencing issue between HubSpot and GTM tags?\n\nAny help would be hugely appreciated‚Äîthank you in advance!

They might want to be your customers but not have anything to do with Google. So they should be able to know that interacting with you means to automatically interact with Google. \n\nGDPR wants you to make this kind of information transparent and give a user the chance to agree or disagree to data gathering. \n\nIn my opinion, it‚Äôs a good thing to give people this kind of control.\n\nIf you start a project from scratch GDPR is really not that difficult to comply to. There are many GDPR compliant alternatives to Google Analytics that don‚Äôt use cookies and are more privacy conscious. Just don‚Äôt collect any personally identifiable data unless you need to and give the user a chance to agree or disagree before. That‚Äôs really the key. \n\nAlso the privacy policy doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. List the information you gather on them, list the providers that your website is using (like the hosting provider) and link to their privacy policy, tell users why you need that data that you collect, and provide a contact email so they know how they can request their data to be deleted. \n\nThere are a few more details. But if you follow some common sense basics, GDPR doesn‚Äôt even have to be an issue and you may not even need a banner.",

Embedding a YouTube video (even with the `nocookie` domain), Bandcamp, Soundcloud, GOOGLE FONTS*, etc. adds cookies. So eventually I took no chances and embed third party content using placeholders managed by JavaScript. You see a preview of \"_There is media here, but you must provide consent_\" after which a click will provide consent (if you were to ignore the banner that shows up on first visit). Once a user has consented to cookies, all third party content - embeds and GA tracking - become active. Once you set up such a mechanism, it's very easy to manage, but applying this to several years of pages containing embedded content is a drag.\n\nI'm talking mostly cookies here because those are the hardest to manage because _they are outside of your direct control_. If you store user generated content, you must go the extra mile to allow users to delete said content at any time.\n\nHowever, despite the amount of work it gives you, I don't \"mind\" GDPR, its very nice to be transparent about data collection as the internet became a wild west over the past years.\n\n_*Somebody in Austria (I think) once sued someone because their site used Google Fonts which stored a cookie on their computer.

The basis of my claim was the statement of an individual who said that the website in question had no actual affiliation with their organization, and that my content was submitted to said website under false pretenses. Google ruled in favor of my claim and removed the content from search, although the following notice now appears on Google.\n\n*In response to a complaint we received under the*¬†[*US Digital Millennium Copyright Act*](https://www.google.com/support/answer/1386831)*, we have removed X result(s) from this page. If you wish, you may¬†read the DMCA Complaint¬†that caused the removal(s) at¬†LumenDatabase.org.*\n\nHowever, the organization in question still hasn't removed the content from their website (although it no longer appears in Google search). And upon further investigation, it looks like the website may be affiliated with the organization after all and that what the individual told me was inaccurate. My questions are:\n\n1. Will the \"In response to a complaint...\" notice ever \"fall off\" from Google Search? It's been a month now and it's still appearing. Will it be there in perpetuity or is there a time period where it no longer appears?\n2. Since the organization hasn't removed the content yet from their website, if I submit a separate DMCA notice that's not through Google and approved, will that replace the current Lumen notice that's appearing on my search results? Again Google just removed it from search but the content is still there on the website.\n3. If I wanted to retract my initial Google claim entirely based on the recent discovery the website is still affiliated with the organization, what would be the best way of doing that?\n\nHappy to expand further on this as what I provided may be too vague or confusing.

With limited experience in website development, I recently had the opportunity to start an online store connected to my line of work.

Product pages can sometimes take over 6 seconds to load, and I am unsure of what to look into next. Could anyone help me understand why my pages load slowly?\n\nHere's some additional information:\n\n* **Website structure:** The site is built with WordPress, Elementor, and WooCommerce, along with a plugin provided by my supplier. This plugin powers the search functionality and displays results. Once a product is selected, the plugin adds it to WooCommerce‚Äôs ‚ÄúProducts,‚Äù and WooCommerce then displays it on the product page. I‚Äôve tested this plugin on a clean site, and it performs fast there. I have also seen other websites that are build the same way that are fast.\n* **Essential Plugins**: The site cannot function without Elementor, as the supplier's plugin does not support Gutenberg.\n* **Image Loading**: I have no control over how images are added to products‚Äîthey are automatically sourced from my supplier. There are many products, so manually optimizing images isn‚Äôt feasible. I use the Smush plugin for image optimization.\n* **Additional Optimization**: I started using Rocket CDN today, but it hasn‚Äôt noticeably improved the speed either.\n* **Plugin Count**: I have already reduced the number of plugins significantly and currently use 17 essential ones. While I could disable one or two more, this has not improved load times in tests.\n\nHere‚Äôs a list of my current plugins:\n\n* Code Snippets\n* EED SEO Add-on\n* EED WP Plugin\n* Elementor\n* Elementor Pro\n* Google for WooCommerce\n* Minimum Purchase Amount for WooCommerce\n* Quantity Field on Shop Page for WooCommerce\n* Rank Math SEO\n* Rank Math SEO PRO\n* Redis Object Cache\n* Smush\n* WooCommerce\n* WooPayments\n* WP Consent API\n* WP Rocket\n* WP Rocket | Filter the Content of the Used CSS\n\nWebsite: [https://sedora.nl](https://sedora.nl)\n\nExample of slow-loading pages:\n\n* [https://www.sedora.nl/fornuis-onderdelen/](https://www.sedora.nl/fornuis-onderdelen/)\n* [https://www.sedora.nl/koelkast-onderdelen/](https://www.sedora.nl/koelkast-onderdelen/)\n\nCould someone please help point me in the right direction for improving site speed?\n\n¬†",

With the recent migration from Google Domains to Squarespace, I noticed one of my domains was set to expire in 30 days, so I decided to give Cloudflare a try and see how their registrar service stacked up.\n\nAfter requesting the transfer code and initiating the transfer to Cloudflare, I received an email from Squarespace informing me of a 5-day grace period if I wanted to stop and cancel the transfer. There was no way to expedite the process, which was a bit annoying but fine nonetheless. I went ahead and transferred a different domain from Namecheap to Cloudflare, and the process completed in about 5 minutes.\n\nBack to Squarespace, the 5-day grace period ended yesterday and I didn't see any updates in the Cloudflare panel nor received any confirmation that the transfer was successful. For context, my domain is set to expire on June 22nd, which is why I contacted support to get this matter resolved as quickly as possible.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpthxmst4f3d1.png?width=422&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f658f59772d68957ab9c41a6ada8c7a993d7bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dppfxmst4f3d1.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=11132528080bc60a8d7a22557bfc7157cbbfcf58\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6412nst4f3d1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5c8ab752aa91820cdec1c67e321637110ed290b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3n7emust4f3d1.png?width=419&format=png&auto=webp&s=bff9e1a9fcdbf080cd18e540881d03ede2350358\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbbj5pst4f3d1.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed04bc95720ac4845ba19db687bf98f1ac58b0a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkhefqst4f3d1.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9e8247256b34f848db272d523d04ac6d3237de\n\n[https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011719247-Domain-transfer-timing](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011719247-Domain-transfer-timing)\n\nInterestingly, for domains transferred into Squarespace, the linked article mentions: \"If you're not sure if they released your domain, you can contact them to ask. We have¬†a sample message¬†you can use.\" They provide a sample message for you to send, yet they can't expedite the process themselves when you're transferring a domain away.\n\nThere are no status or indications that there is anything going on with said domain, I have to take their word that the transfer is in progress and will be completed in the time they indicated. On the bright side, setting up with Cloudflare was straightforward, they offer great pricing, and setting up DNS records as \"DNS only\" and \"Proxied\" worked as expected.",

        "selftext": "I'm a freelance web / sofware developer who's trying to figure out the business side of my craft. I NEVER know what to price myself. I see a lot of web designers who make pretty designs that don't seem very functional but likely charge a decent amount of money for it. I see developers that make pretty enough sites that also get paid well.\n\nI'm after a single question: How can you prove the value of your website / the product you're building?\n\nI ask because as a freelance developer, I'm currently in every role. Designer, sales, client onbaording, etc. Right now, clients come to me with their ideas, I do my best to build them a working website / webapp to handle their request for some amount of money. That's my entire job and figuring out the process to make this more efficient.\n\nMy prices, quite frankly, I do pull out nowhere. I just say an amount that sounds good, or link an hourly rate to a listed estimate of each part of the website / webapp and go from there.\n\nThe reason is, in some cases the client probably also doesn't know what they're looking for, and it kind of feels like my fault if I'm messing this part up and can't actually answer why a website is valuable for a company to have. I mean like some REAL official reason. \n\nNot just like \"Because other businesses have one\" or \"because I built it and it's inherently valuable\".\n\nI feel like every website I build should have all of the works, analytics, legal / terms of service, privacy policy and cookie consent, all of that jazz. Which is in itself a LOOOT of work. \n\nI mean I\"m fine with that so long as I get paid for it lmao. But still. \n\nThat's a lot of work, but how do you really know it's valuable? Is it a risk? Do you have to prove it with analytics and metrics? Should A/B testing be involved?\n\nOr, can it just be \"good enough\" for the owner of the business / project and that's just that?",

                "body": "20 YOE here. Seriously, it is mostly made up and what you think you can get from your client. You have to read the room and know what they are willing to pay.\n\nFor example, I had one client where I knew they always had 40K left over every year.  End of year, \"use it or loose it\" type budget. If they don't spend it, they lose it next year. I knew the stakeholders well enough to know how to price because it really didn't matter to them individually. It was the company,'s money and they had a budget to blow on a vendor. So when I estimate, I'll have a fixed amount in my mind. Divide it by my rate and go from there. Obviously, I would not gouge them. But hey, $175 an hour, 3 weeks is roughly $21,000. They had a budget of $25k, I round it down to $19K and offer it as a discount. The project may take 3 weeks or it takes 2 weeks. Sometimes it could even take 4 or 5 weeks. But that was roughly the estimate we both agreed on.  \n\n\nObviously, I can't do the same for other clients. I had the same stakeholder who now moved on to another job and asked me to do some minor work and I gave a lowball quote - $2k to update their certs and run a security audit. 3 years ago, she would not have scoffed at a $40k enterprise project but now she has a new job working for a small mom-n-pop so the dynamics are different. Again, I feel out the room and leverage my relationship to extract the ceiling.\n\nI'll get downvoted for being so blunt but that is the reality of it. I am also a client and pay for whatever, because, the money wasn't mine. I have a budget and I'll use it. If that vendor has been approved and a track record, I am not going to nickle and dime negotiate. I have x amount of dollars, you want the work? I need a contract and a timeline. The rest is yours. \n\nSo yeah, it is going vary wildly in the higher enterprise space.",

Apparently there is a lot of static content hosted under [getcatcaretips.b-cdn.net](http://getcatcaretips.b-cdn.net) (bunny.net) that is not found, including scripts and images.\n\nIf I had to guess, the images contain an empty SVG as an optimization to load the page faster. As soon as the page is loaded, it is supposed to execute a script to load the actual images. But for some reason your CDN has been deactivated, so the page can't access the scripts and the actual images.\n\nHope this helps.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I just built a website for the first time and I'm bumping into some last minutes issues. \n\nMy homepage displays my showreel taking the whole width and height of the screen on autoplay, the the user is prompet to scroll down with a button. I like the layout. \n\nUntil yesterday night I was using my own video of almost 100mb (yes I committed that crime I know) and then I found out it'd eat out my bandwidth and was pretty much an irresponsable move. I first tried to embed it with youtube but a few months ago they made it impossible to hide both the title of the video and the youtube logo (which really devaluates the hero for me). Therefore I moved to vimeo, but the issue now is that their js (that is necessary to run the video) is taking extremely long and is seriously slowing the loading of the homage according to google pagespeed insights. It's such a shame because vimeo has a great \"background=1&\" embed code that's really convenient. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7zxkcxeobpd1.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=b529d62fc17c14fec296bd5d509953fb860a01be\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zqmfvbxeobpd1.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c95a4670468d3a1db3e4e5979d5c1229ccb1a6a\n\nThe rest of my js is just a clickable button to copy my mail, a clickable button to show/hide a subpage of my works, and that's pretty much it. It was working fine before today so I really can't suspect anything other than vimeo. \n\nAny solutions ? Thank you",

You'll also need to implement google consent mode V2 if you are using Google Analytics or other google services (such as Google ads)\n\n\n2) Yep, it's really annoying. Since we implemented the cookie popup on our sites we have a consent rate of around 80% that roughly explains the 20% visitor drop in our analytics.\n\n\n3) You could set it up only for EU. Many CMP offer this possibility. You might want to read about the CCPA if you have some visitors from California or some states such as Virginia. Those states don't require a cookie banner but some kind of opt-out form from collecting and selling data.\n\nHope that helps!",

        "id": "1ecragg",
        "selftext": "Hi. My understanding is that the trend is for consent banners, and that this trend will only grow outside the EU (even Australia may mandate it sometime down the road?).  I am looking for a Consent Mode approved Partner of Google Ads (I guess one of the approved partners at https://cmppartnerprogram.withgoogle.com/), that offers the following, in order of highest priority to lowest priority:\n\n1 - Highest Priority: A consent banner that is smaller on mobile so the user can at least see more of my landing page and hero image. The Cookiebot banner totally blocks out your entire landing page on mobile and that's annoying. The CookieYes mobile banner is better on mobile and I can at least see the top 1/4 of the landing page, although 3/4 of the landing page is covered by the banner. And on desktop, hopefully the banner blocks out as little as possible (even here, CookieYes is better than CookieBot).\n\n2 - Next Highest Priority: The banner offers a geolocation option, such that the banner is only shown to countries where legally, it must be shown.  CookieYes offers such an option for $20 per month.  This is a nice to have option, although if I can find a partner that offers a much smaller banner on mobile (and desktop) that doesn't block the landing page much, I can forgo a geolocation option. \n\nAre there any good suggestions on what partners to Google Ads that offer such a banner at a reasonable price for a small business? Free is better of course, but I am expecting to pay (ie. CookieYes's price of $20 per month is reasonable, but I hope not to go much higher than that price).",

Creating user profile page that could store; name, phone number, email and what jobs they are looking for, possible CV + personal letter.\n2. Giving option to user to:\n- Allow us to say X people are looking for jobs in the job categories that they are following\n- Perhaps some options that will let us either: A: send a email to them saying X company is looking hire people within X section, allow us to send your CV?\nB: Basically have some option that lets the company browse though job seekers and read their qualifications but not share name/profile pic/email etc \n\nSo since we are EU company we need to adhere to GDPR and I want to get advice on what we actually need to implement for compliance. I feel like all the guides online is created for 1000+ companies and not super small ones so I'm abit unclear what needs to be done.\nIf anyone can correct me/add to my list I would appreciate it so much ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nConsent:\n\nUser profile, check boxes with options for allowing us to:\n\na. Let companies know X people looking for jobs in the occupations they follow on the site.\nb. Give information about the user qualifications to company which we then can let the user know that X is interested in them.\n\nc. Send SMS/email about new job postings in the occupations they subscribe to.\nd. Send SMS/email if company is interested in them (if option B is checked)\n\nData security:\na. Ensure that the data don't leave outside of EU, we are using a few third party vendors that hosts on AWS. They are well-known so I'm hopeful they are/can GDPR compliance.\nb. Ensure data is secured by limiting access.\n\nOpt-out:\na.Creating a page for logged-in users can;\nRequest their data from us and exported to a json (xml/excel? not sure yet)\nb. Delete all the info about them, that would probably also involve deleting their details on the page (name, phone , CV etc)\n\nI'm I missing something? I feel like Creating a GDPR diary or GDPR compliance person for a 9 person company is super overkill..",

However, I just switched from Vercel to Cloudflare because I'm broke and I needed some features that were premium on Vercel. By the way, I am talking about cookie-free analytics.\n\nSo, what do web analytics tools even do? Isn't it just a script in the code that pushes data to a database whenever a user enters the website, while also distinguishing users from each other (in some way without cookies)? I mean, how hard can that be?\n\nI found [this on quora](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-build-my-own-web-analytics-platform) where everybody is saying that it is really hard, but everyone is also trying to sell \"a better, already existing alternative.\"\n\nFor clarification, I probably won't build anything, but I'm just wondering what's going on with them. If I were to make one, it would be primarily for myself, but who knows. If I did make one, it would just be bare minimum tracking stuff, unlike Google Analytics (cookies).",

Really it depends how good you want it to be.¬†Sure, you can add something in your server side code to every request, but that will also log make response times slower.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like those quora grifters, I also wrote my own analytics script and there is a LOT to it, even for my simple use case. A few of the considerations:\n\n- performance - I used an AJAX request onload\n- detecting bots vs real people (using JS eliminates some, but you also need to check the user agent as Googlebot executes JS now)\n- deciding on what to actually log\n- ensuring privacy (e.g. to be GDPR compliant you shouldn‚Äôt log the IP directly, I logged a hash then compared future requests to that hash)\n- how to avoid the database filling up (in my case it‚Äôs a busy site, many GB were stored within weeks)\n- how to process the data - trying to count stats from a multi-GB table is sloooow, so I have cron jobs running to process it into summary tables\n- things like admin login to see the stats, database migrations etc.",

But if I were to paste this into my browser on, say, another phone which has the app also, it of course wouldn't actually log me in on that other device.\n\n\n\nHowever. Somebody else was able to do exactly that. I'm guessing they've set up their own Facebook app to act as an intermediate & allow them to just open my link, which would redirect them into my account on the application in question using the OAuth token & \"feeding\" that response to Monopoly Go in some way.

It seems that they have set up their own Facebook app intermediate for this purpose, but I'm not sure since I've never developed a Facebook app.\n\n\n\nI've URL decoded each URL in the post so it is easier to comprehend.\n\nFrom what I can gather, I would assume if I am correct in my theory, the flow of the intermediate application would be something like this:\n\n\n\nme >> app >> oauth idp >> I log in >> oauth idp sends token to app >> app logs in and redirects to Monopoly Go app\\`\\`\\`",

As responsive ads didn‚Äôt work as intended, we had to develop our own scaling solution without any proper documentation, but that turned out to be the smallest of our concerns.\n\nRevenue for the first week was surprisingly good - However, when we wanted to receive the first payment, we ran into issues, as our account type was erroneously set to ‚Äûcompany‚Äú - Could have been my mistake. \n\nUnfortunately, according to the support pages, you cannot change the account type (even though we had never received any payment!), which is why we had to close our account and lose out on a quite significant sum.\n\nWith the account closed and a new account created, we were confident that everything would work out now, but in fact, nothing did. \n\nAt first, our account got repeatedly suspended as we allegedly had ‚Äûmultiple accounts‚Äú which was against the guidelines - which we didn‚Äôt. This happened a few times until I had the idea to change the details of your account contact, which worked to resolve this issue (but certainly is a problem on google‚Äòs side). \n\nWith that done and everything configured (again) we were eagerly waiting for our website to be verified and accepted once again. \n\nThe verification process took only, and I‚Äòm saying only as it took far longer the first time, a week but to our frustration, our website got rejected.\n\nThroughout the entire process, we messaged the support 7 times and never got a response that even answered or matched our query. My suspicion is that the are just emails being chosen automatically based on the words included in the question, which certainly upset us even more, as we spent a lot of time communicating with the ‚Äûsupport‚Äú.\n\nThis time again, the support could not tell us why our website got rejected or even addressed our issue, rather wrote about how the verification process can take a while and that we should be patient  and ensure our website is online (?). \n\nI have no idea why the website got rejected this time and it doesn‚Äôt make sense, as the same site got approved a month ago.\n\nWe always made sure to follow all policies and integrated consent management etc. in the ways that google recommends. \n\nThroughout the past month, we did not receive any money from google and had to cover all our operational costs out of our own pockets. \n\nI‚Äòm utterly disappointed by Adsense and am looking for alternatives and have contacted a few (Eozic, Snigel, Media.net) which haven‚Äòt responded for 2 weeks now. \n\nDo you guys have any recommendations or a direct contact to google?",

On the client side, this makes it simpler to add \"Remember Me\" functionality -you simply wouldn't issue a refresh token- and on the backend offers better user tracking for any actions taken during a specific session, offering a better security experience on both ends. \n\nIf permissions change while a user is logged in you, generally need to terminate the existing session and start a new one, which is seamless if you're using a refresh token. \n\nAt scale, it's less resource intensive to validate a session token instead of thoroughly checking credentials each time or issuing new tokens. Sessions can live in cache or in-memory databases. This makes session tokens more convenient and performant, but less secure. Having sessions expire periodically mitigates abuse of a given session token, while balancing that against having the authorization of each and every request validated by the more authoritative and permanent database.",

So I discovered the gmail api nothing new but for me was the oh snap thats it moment...now the 2nd part is a little harder for me but i've learned and put together some more puzzle pieces...Gemini AI API.\n\nI've also seen Google already has a feature to do exactly what I want and others offer some sort of workflow automations but not sure what route to go. Long story short I'm trying to use the Gmail API to connect to emails with users approval then use Google Gemini AI to search emails for emails based on parameters then return a report. I would greatly appreciate any tips or advice, thank you.\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*Update\\*\\*\\*: Deeper down the rabbit hole. I have figured out what I need to do for this project. I've also been told any skilled developer can complete this in 10 hours or less. Can anyone give me feedback please, appreciate your time.\n\nI will use OAuth 2.0 to obtain user consent for accessing their Gmail accounts. This involves setting up a Google Cloud project and configuring the OAuth consent screen.\n\nI will integrate the Gmail API to fetch and interact with emails. This includes retrieving emails based on user approval.\n\nI will use Google Gemini AI to analyze and search emails based on the specified parameters then generate a detailed report with the search results.\n\nI will build a user-friendly interface using a JavaScript framework like React or next.js which will enable users to authorize the app, input search parameters, and view results.\n\nI will set up a server using Node.js or Python to handle API requests, process data, and manage user sessions securely.",

        "author": "WyvernCo",
        "id": "1bomfne",
        "selftext": "Last week, when I tried to sign in to my Vultr account I was greeted with a popup demanding that I accept a new TOS to continue.  Being a completely normal person who reads TOS documents when asked to, I skimmed the new TOS to see if there was anything objectionable.\n\nUnfortunately, **the new agreement is requiring us to fork over rights to our apps/software for anything hosted on the Vultr platform**.  That goes way too far.  No other datacenter company requires this. \n\nHere is the relevant section from Vultr's new TOS:\n\n> information, text, opinions, messages, comments, audio visual works, motion pictures, photographs, animation, videos, graphics, sounds, music, software, Apps, and any other content or material that You or your end users submit, upload, post, host, store, or otherwise make available (‚ÄúMake Available‚Äù) on or through the **Services** (collectively, ‚ÄúYour Content,‚Äù ‚ÄúContent‚Äù or ‚ÄúUser Content‚Äù).\n\n> ...\n\n> You hereby grant to Vultr a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your User Content, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and otherwise use and **commercialize the User Content in any way that Vultr deems appropriate, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you** or to any third parties, for purposes of providing the Services to you.\n\nThis is NOT standard contract language for web services.  I don't know of anywhere else that requires this.\n\nFor comparison, Digital Ocean specifically limits this clause to uploads on their website (ie, for community articles, forum posts, etc), not for all hosted services (which would include virtual machines, databases, etc).  Additionally, commercialization rights are not granted and it is not perpetual:\n\nDigital Ocean TOS Excerpt:\n\n> We will periodically differentiate between our websites such as digitalocean.com (which we will refer to collectively as the ‚ÄúWebsites‚Äù) and all of our other services, such as our cloud infrastructure and other paid services (which we will refer to collectively as the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù).\n\n> ...\n\n> By providing your User Content to or via the **Websites**, you grant DigitalOcean a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels.\n\nThough requesting limited permissions for the purposes of user uploads on a forum or other community site is fairly standard, it is not reasonable for a service provider partner to require full, irrevocable commercial rights of anything hosted on their services.  That'd let Vultr take and monetize customer databases, apps, software, etc. which almost every business would likely find objectionable.  Vultr needs to restrict their request as is done elsewhere in the industry.\n\nHere is another example -- AWS does not have such broad terms, except for their generative AI product:\n\n> 50.12.7. PartyRock Apps. ‚ÄúPartyRock App‚Äù means any application created or remixed through PartyRock, including any app snapshot and all corresponding source code. By creating or remixing a PartyRock App, you hereby grant: (a) AWS and its affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to access, reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, transmit, display, perform and otherwise exploit your PartyRock App in connection with PartyRock; and (b) anyone who accesses your PartyRock App (‚ÄúPartyRock Users‚Äù), a non-exclusive license to access, reproduce, export, use, prepare derivative works based upon, transmit, and otherwise exploit your PartyRock App for any personal purpose. We may reject, remove, or disable your PartyRock App, PartyRock alias, or PartyRock account at any time for any reason with or without notice to you. You are responsible for your PartyRock Apps, PartyRock Data, and use of your PartyRock Apps, including compliance with the Policies as defined in the Agreement and applicable law. Except as provided in this Section 50.12, we obtain no rights under the Agreement to PartyRock Data or PartyRock Apps. Neither AWS, its Affiliates, nor PartyRock Users have any obligations to make any payments to you in connection with your PartyRock Apps. You will defend and indemnify AWS and its Affiliates for any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees) arising out of or in any way related to Your PartyRock Apps or your use of PartyRock. Do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in the input that you provide to create or use a PartyRock App.\n\nNote how the license grant doesn't infect the rest of AWS offerings, but is only restricted to their AI product offering \"PartyRock\".  \n\nIt's possible Vultr may want the expansive license grant in order to do AI/Machine Learning based on the data they host.  Or maybe they could mine database contents to resell PII.  Given the (perpetual!) license, there's not really any limit to what they might do.  They could even clone someone's project and sell their own rebranded version, and they'd be legally in the clear.\n\nI sent my objection to Vultr support, but I've just been getting the run around so far.  I've been trying to get them to at least let me access my account without agreeing to the new TOS so I can migrate out to another provider, but I'm now on day 5 of being locked out with no end in sight.  Migrating all my servers and DNS without being able to login to my account is going to be both a headache and error prone.  I feel like they're holding my business hostage and extorting me into accepting a license I would never consent to under duress.  I'm self employed and the product I host (currently) on Vultr is what pays my rent, so not being able to manage it is a pretty serious concern for me.\n\nAnyway, I don't know what Vultr's plans are, but I think it's definitely worth pushing back on this overly expansive license grant they're giving to themselves.  If Vultr gets away with it, other hosts may try to sneak it into their contracts, too",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\n[chat.positive-intentions.com](http://chat.positive-intentions.com/)\n\nI'm excited to share with you a messaging application I've been working on that might interest you. This is a chat app designed to work within your browser, there a focus on browser-based security and decentralization.\n\nWhat makes this app unique is that it doesn't rely on messaging servers to function. Instead, it works based on your browser's javascript capabilities, so even low-end devices should work.\n\nHere are some features of the app:\n\n* Secure messaging: Your messages are encrypted, making them more secure.\n* File sharing: Easily share files using WebRTC technology and QR codes.\n* Voice and video calls: Connect with others through voice and video calls.\n* Shared virtual space: Explore a shared mixed-reality space, similar to a metaverse.\n* Image board: Browse and share images in a scrollable format, similar to Instagram.\n\nYour security is a top priority. Here's how the app keeps you safe:\n\n* Decentralized authentication: No central server is required for login, making it harder for anyone to gain unauthorized access.\n* Unique IDs: Your ID is cryptographically random, adding an extra layer of security.\n* End-to-end encryption: Your messages are encrypted from your device to the recipient's device, ensuring only you and the recipient can read them.\n* Local data storage: Your data is stored only on your device, not on any external servers.\n* Self-hostable: You have the option to host the app on your own server if you prefer.\n\nThe app is still in the early stages and I'm exploring what's possible with this technology. I'd love to hear your feedback on the idea and the current state of the app. If you have any feature requests or ideas, I'm all ears in the comments below!\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\n* The app: [chat.positive-intentions.com](http://chat.positive-intentions.com/)\n* More information about the app: [positive-intentions.com](http://positive-intentions.com/)\n* Follow the subreddit to keep updated about the app: [r/positive\\_intentions](https://www.reddit.com/r/positive_intentions/)\n\nNote 1: As a solo-developer, i dont have the capacity or knowlege to do anything like an \"official launch\". i expect the app will progressively get better with feedback from users (as it has so far).\n\nNote 2: I think the app has (approximately?) reached a feature-complete state, but i'm not sure. I'm looking for feedback on what features are missing, and what features are not needed. The next step would be to grow the number of users by making the app more user-friendly and easier to use. (I need your help on this)\n\nNote 3: The app is not open source yet (sorry), but im open to answering questions about how the code is working (more details can be found in the docs). Open sourcing the app is something i would like to do in the future, but not a priority right now. Some parts of the app are open source.\n\nNote 4: The UI is a clunky implementation of Material-UI. It's something i will fix as i move towards open sourcing the UI components. i will take the opportunity to also give more attention to a \"desktop friendly UI\" (right now the app is best experienced on a mobile device).\n\nNote 5: Id like to keep the wording i have for \"pods\" although i have recieved feedback about it not being clear what it means. A pod is what you might think of as like a \"chat room\" and will be further developed to support group-chat. you can create a pod with a connected peer in the contact-details-page. The wording \"pod\" comes from how a group of whales is called a pod.",

Like, activate it and then look at the analytics pages in Cloudflare. No API integration required. Bonus is that you can capture more users with Cloudflare, as many privacy-concious web users will have most analytics blocked.\n\nIf you require more control like custom events and such, there're a bunch of GA alternatives which are not so privacy-invasive.

Anything further down will be subject to the caching rules you have set up and may not track every visitor. \n\nIf you are confident that no HTML requests are cached and you use node as your server, you can use google‚Äôs universal analytics. It will still have the traffic discrepancy, but at least it‚Äôll be a familiar interface.

What would you guys do and how would you approach this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some background**\n\n1. Client has never failed to pay me, and has basically never been late. \n2. 3 years ago he ran his company in excel documents. I basically created a site that allowed people to upload data, and then it verified and processed the data. Verified data does a bunch of checks with 3rd party apis, then gets sent to other people on his team. There is a bit more to it than that, but thats the jist of it.  \n3. He told me I have saved over 100 hours of manual labor per week for him and his team. There is a lot of automation and webhooks on the site that handle a lot of the stuff they use to do manually. \n4. I'm pretty weak on server knowledge, I use Laravel Forge to handle most of that. \n5. I handle all the support. Support with bugs, support with teams messing something up, support with helping the teams use something new, etc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New Stuff he wants** \n\nI bring this up because he now wants to integrate his company banking into the platform. Using the banks api to create, manage, track transactions and invoices. Along with reports, etc. \n\nHiring other developers to work under me, to handle the smaller work loads. With me reviewing their work before putting it in production\n\nTheres a few more things he wants, but thats the jist of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of my friends mentioned I should be asking for a lot more. Since I am basically running all the code, keeping it up to date, handling all the support, handling the servers, etc. I'm not sure, so I am wondering what some of you guys do. I am a firm believer of \"your rate is your rate\" and every time I have asked for an increase in my hourly, its gone up. \n\nBut I also don't know if charging a minimum fee everything month is a good idea?

The [Wide Angle Analytics](https://wideangle.co) is built and hosted in the EU (Germany/France) on EU Cloud. No transfer outside the EU. We invested in a GDPR audit and have a professional DPO. Everything is secured and encrypted (we can't encrypt data in-use for obvious reasons, but we encrypt even local traffic between servers).\n\nBecause we did this extra leg work, we offer the ability to process Personal Data.

You can deploy WAA without cookie banner and be compliant, but should you wish to process more, we are ready to support you in a compliant manner. \n\n\nTL;DR deploy Wide Angle Analytics, without Cookie Banner, with custom domain and get much more accurate and reliable view of your website traffic.",

I know I am going to have a Privacy Policy section for this. \n\nWe do not make use of any cookies on the site that I am aware of, although the site was built with NextJS, and there may be cookies used automatically with that framework that I am not aware of.\n\nThe website is based in UK and has to follow UK/EU GDPR policies.\n\nMy first question, do I need a cookie banner if I do not store, save or use any cookies on the website?\n\nIf yes, what should the cookie banner say? Does anybody have any examples? Also, do I need to store responses to the cookie banner, like when they accept I'd need to make sure the cookie banner doesn't keep coming back and save their preference or acknowledgement? I don't have any form of storage like a database for this, as this is a purely front-end build at the minute. Do I need to implement a back-end database and API to store these responses?\n\nIt all seems a little over the top for what I am trying to do - I understand that data protection and privacy is important, but I am not attempting to store any cookies.\n\nAny assistance or pointing in the right direction would be ideal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers!  \n",

True, but web apps are still apps. Is he saying it's hard to make independent money building consumer apps? True, people only install a few core apps over and over again. But that's natural. Just like devs earn in IT by building custom software for large companies rather than everyone building a new desktop app, knowing consumers only need a browser and a media player... there will still be money in highly specialized apps paid for by a company that makes money elsewhere",

What do I have to do/what consent do I need to be able to send this data to **Sentry**?\n\nCan anyone with experience in this area provide some guidance?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I'm using CookieBot if that helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you very much!",

        "selftext": "I am very new to OAuth so there's a lot of holes in my knowledge.\n\nI have this POC system where a node express server would provide users a URL that they're supposed to visit on their mobile phone browsers where they would consent with their Google accounts resulting in an auth code that the node express server then exchanges for access/refresh tokens (Authorization code flow using Google OAuth 2.0).\n\nMy question is, would it be acceptable if these tokens are then passed and used by a separate device (not the mobile device that the user used to consent) so that said device can include the tokens in its HTTP request headers and make authenticated calls to some protected API?\n\nThe way the node express server would \"pass\" it to the separate device is by having the device poll the server while the user goes through the consenting/authorization process on their mobile phone's browser.\n\n**Why am I doing this?**\n\nI have a device that has limited UI capabilities (it doesn't have a browser) that I want to be able to call [Google's Device Access APIs](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access) from.\n\nIt needs to be able to allow users to consent with their Google accounts using Google's OAuth, but since it does not have a browser, its options of doing that are limited. **I understand that OAuth has the Device Authorization flow for these cases** [but the API scope that my device needs to use is not supported if authenticating via Device Flow on Google's OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/limited-input-device#allowedscopes).\n\nSo I've devised this system that mimics the device authorization flow using a node express server and the authorization code flow to allow the user to consent using their mobile phone's browser instead.\n\nMy main concern is that this system could be ignoring OAuth best practices or could be outright misusing the protocol. Again I'm new to OAuth. I'm not even sure what would be considered the OAuth client in this system because while the node express server is the one exchanging the auth code for tokens, it's ultimately not the one that would consume them.\n\nNote: My system also uses user/device code pairs to identify each \"linking\" session.\n\nAny thoughts?",

So it is not feasible to assume that you must only enforce it on European IP's. Additionally, if you do any business with California, they have a very similar set of restrictions known as CCPA. So both of those need to be considered.\n\nIt's worth noting that the modal is not the critical part. It is part of the implementation, but just as important is developing a notice to your customers of what cookies you drop, a system for adding any new cookie based apps where they are categorized and declared, and also allowing for right to deletion. And in right to deletion, you need to have a posted policy of how to request that a user's data be entirely removed from all of your systems.\n\nAll that being said - there shouldn't really be a lot of organizational ambiguity over this. If you are not past a certain size - say a dozen or more employees - I think the likelihood that you will get in a lot of trouble is minimal. \n\nRegardless of the law - data privacy is a big deal and worth taking very seriously. The data we are legally allowed to have and what we are allowed to do with it is wildly immoral and problematic.

This applies to storing info in cookies or localstorage, but if the user actually enters their login data and checks the remember me box, that's sufficient consent and no popups are needed, because your site is only doing what they explicitly requested.\n\nSo if you don't use Google Analytics, Facebook tracking or other similar services to gather information and statistics, you don't need explicit consent modal.

Loading a Google font from google.com? No you don't unless the user actively consented to this. Embedding a YouTube video or a tweet? Hell no you don't unless the user consented.\n\nYou don't need a modal for that right after the page loaded, but then you need to postpone loading any external stuff until the user consented. For embedding content it can be done [the way Borlabs Cookie does it](https://borlabs.io/borlabs-cookie/iframe-demo/).

        "selftext": "I had some issues figuring out how to load 3rd party tracking scripts like Google Analytics without render blocking killing page speed. The advice on forums and blogs included all sorts of random timing delays and scroll or interaction event triggers - way too complicated for something so trivial IMO.\n\nAdding to that, dealing with GDPR consent pop ups. I‚Äôve used cookie-bot and a few others, but also adds to the page delay because you have to load their scripts too. \n\nI stumbled across Cloudflare Zaraz - and although it‚Äôs only in beta, it‚Äôs super useful. Basically, instead of putting the JS in your headers, you can offload 3rd party scrips to their cloud, and injecting the scripts without interfering with load speeds. The interface is a more simple version of google tag manager, a little rough around the edges.\n\nIt also comes with a consent manager that you can use to inject a pop up, quite rudimentary and requires a little CSS to make it look a little more on brand ‚Äî but overall, very impressive platform. Page speed is now 100% across mobile and desktop, whereas before Zaraz, I had 83% on mobile.\n\nIt does make it easier if you are proxied through Cloudflare on DNS, I use the Pages hosting so integration is dead simple ‚Äî however, they do support manual loading outside of Cloudflare too (see docs link below).Hope this helps, because I know how much we all love dealing with cookies.\n\nHere is a link to the docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/",

This works and I thought I was done. But then I realized that the **user could sign in with a different Google account** which would generate their own refresh token. I can solve this by storing the refresh token together with google id so each account has their own refresh token and they don't overwrite each other.  \n\nThe problem is, **you only get that refresh token the very first time a user signs in**, unless you show a consent prompt again (which you don't wanna do on every single login). What if local storage gets cleared for some reason? Then I need to show the consent prompt again. But **I can't know this in advance**, because I don't know which Google account the user is going to pick before they actually logged in.\n\nIf there was only one single Google account they could log in with, I could just check if the **refresh token in local storage is null** and I would know that I needed to show the consent prompt again (to get a new refresh token).

        "author": "currentXchange",
        "id": "juekrg",
        "selftext": "# What is Web 4?\n\nWeb 4 is a set of four **modular paradigms** and practices that allow integration of **provable democracy in any social system** that seeks to be more collaborative (organization, government, community, etc.). Modularity allows any project to adopt one or more of these principles to **increase the accuracy, fairness, and transparency** of each individual's role in **collaboration**. \n\n# [Read on Github](https://github.com/dougbutner/web-4)\n\nWeb 4 is **built on top of web 3** (it's blockchain-based) while being **fundamentally different** and providing enough **benefit to society** warrant the new title of web 4. \n\nIn essence, web 4 is **positive attention catalyzer**, built on providing power to every that only gains meaning when they give it freely to another. This power is also freely given, and limited by time. \n\n> Web 4 combines real-world components like time and geography with existing blockchain technology.\n\nIn this manifesto, I will define each of the **components** of web 4, provide **psudeocode** to illustrate the minimum integration into web 2/3, introduce the **benefits to society**, and offer a **roadmap** to adopting these concepts.\n\n# Background\n\nBefore we detail web 4, we must look briefly at the concepts of web 1, web 2, and web 3. \n\n - **Web 1**\n**Static web**. Files are served from a remote server to a user's browser.\n\n - **Web 2**\n**Dynamic web**. Web pages take a user's information and desires into account to build a unique experience for them. Asynchronous requests allow single page applications to thrive. Applications are still served from a central server.\n\n - **Web 3**\n**Decentralized web**. Applications, often open-source, exist in distributed networks instead of a central server. This unfederated model trades control and censorship ability for freedom and autonomy. \n\n - **Web 4**\n**Democratic web**. Time-limited cryptographic tokens are given to each individual, and used as a measure of opinion or desire in collaborative systems.\n\nToday, the top 100 websites by traffic are [all](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) web 2 websites. The web 2 paradigm fits closely with the wider environment of **corporate-owned information.** \n\nAs more and more individuals and societies are reconsidering the place of **government, censorship, centralization and federated power**, web 3 has emerged as a powerful, provable option to shape the evolution of society on planet Earth. \n\nA growing portion of web 2 websites and applications today have elements of web 3, like [cryptoblogs](https://peakd.com) and [games](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings/category/games). While web 2 and web 3 can operate independently, web 3 enhances the abilities of web 2. Similarly, web 3 and web 4 can operate independently, but it makes the most sense for web 4 to be built on blockchain tech to gain the benefits of reliability and transparency. \n\n## Guiding Philosophy\nWeb 4 seeks to implement [biomimetic](https://biomimicry.org/what-is-biomimicry/) systems in **harmony with the universe itself** by replicating nature: the **abundance** of the Sun, rising **entropy**, and the **equality** of each human being. \n\nI believe when we create information systems in **harmonic resonance** with natural systems, our society will be able to advance more rapidly than ever before, as we will be able to **synchronize energetically** with the larger systems of information processing around us (the Earth, Sun, and Galactic core). \n\n\n## Defining Web 4\nWeb 4 introduces **four modular components** for **provably democratic systems** built on top of web 3's open-source decentralized networks. \n\n### There are four conceptual underpinnings (modules) of web 4\n\n 1. **Time-issued cryptocurrency** \n\t Individuals may receive \"Time Tokens\" at given intervals, but never more frequently, and can't hold another's time tokens.\n 2. **Proof of Individuality**\n\t Biometric Secrets, Social Verification, Proof of Liveness, etc\n 3. **Pseudonymity and Information Entropy**\n\t Information degradation over time, pseudo accounts in sensitive systems\n 4. **Harmonic GeoSocial Systems**\n\t Fair, transparent collaboration through accounting the opinions and desires of participants\n\nEach module can be used separately or in tandem. This paper invites you to involve any of these ideas into your current and future projects. We will discuss these concepts one at a time, but first let's examine why we need them in the first place. \n\n\n# Why we can't have Provable democracy with web 3\n> Provable democracy cannot be fully achieved in web 3 itself because there is intentionally no limit over how many accounts a user may control.\n\nDemocracy is essentially reaching a consensus with the idea that **each person is equal** in their influence on that consensus within defined bounds.\n\nMany different consensus models have been developed in web 3, most notably, [proof of work](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work) (**POW**), [proof of stake](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake) (**POS**), and [delegated proof of stake ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/delegated-proof-of-stake-explained)(**DPOS**). These paradigms of consensus are used primarily to determine which chain of transaction records (blocks) is considered valid, \"securing\" a blockchain. \n\nPOS and DPOS is additionally used to in projects like [**Hive**](https://peakd.com) to allow users to \"vote\" on valuable content, an early example of the democratic web. DPOS is also used for networks to determine who can access network resources, such as in [EOSIO blockchains](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md).\n\nHowever, both of these POS/DPOS use cases (curation and resource allocation) are not democratic in the sense that **each account is not equal**. In both cases, the root of democracy is in the token, not the individual, and the ownership of tokens determines the voting power or computing power held by an individual. \n\nIn the end, the only way to implement true democracy in any system is through giving **each individual equal power**. The only way to do this while keeping web3's decentralized nature is to implement the technological (biosecrets) and idealogical (time tokens) advancements needed to be sure an account is owned by **one individual**, and that individual has **only one account**. These advancements  are, for simplicity and communication, called web 4. \n\n___\n# **<center>**1**</center>**\n\n___\n\n\n# Time-issued cryptocurrency (Time Tokens) \n\nTime tokens may be distributed to users' wallets periodically as time passes, or offered to be claimed manually. They work by hashing a unique personal identifier (address) with a time identifier, linking each token to a **person and a span of time**.\n\nThese tokens provide the user with a function or action. The action burns the token, which may cause some change in the state of a system, minting of another token, or any other action. \n\n## The Gears of Time Tokens\n\nTime tokens rely on the following concepts:\n\n 1. **Time Unit**\nA time unit MUST be a superset of a timestamp. This means that a time unit is some amount (or fraction) of seconds. Each time token MUST be the only one in existence stamped with a particular time unit for each user (wallet). Thus, each time token is unique and semi-fungible.\n 2. **Time Token Faucet**\nA time faucet offers any verified user EXACTLY one time token per unit of time passed since their last faucet. This can be an active faucet; requiring some action by the recipient, or a passive faucet; automatically sending the cryptocurrency to the user.\n 3. **Verified Recipients**\nRecipients of the system MUST be verified to be an actual human in order to receive time tokens. \n\nFor a full description of Time Tokens, visit the  [Time Token repository](https://github.com/dougbutner/time-token). \n\n\n## How do Time Tokens work?\nTime tokens store a time unit (integer) with a unique user identifier (string) in a hash signed by the user's biocryptographic signature.\n\nTime tokens are platform independent, and need only store simple data involving time unit and an account identifier at the most bare level.\n\nHere is the minimum information stored in a time token, using [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction/) as an example\n```\n{\n  \"header\": {\n    \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n    \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n  },\n  \"payoadData\": {\n    \"time-unit\": 294957,\n    \"userid\": \"7f3e873a2c3d\"\n  }\n}\n```\nBelow is a brief pseudocode example of how one could use a signed time token as a JWT.\n\nSee Appendix A for more detailed pseudocode of a time token. \n```\nconst passedBioData = {..} // biodata from user\n\nconst header = {\n        \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n        \"alg\": \"HS256\"\n      }\n\nconst payloadData = {\n\t\"time-unit\": \"294957\", \n\t\"userid\": \"7f3e873a2c3d\", \n\t\"appData\": {\n\t\t\"gold\": 479,\n\t\t\"honey\": 23,\n\t\t\"axe\": 0 \n\t}\n}\n\nconst bioSecret = bioKeyGenerator(passedBioData); // Biometric provider's key or one generated direcly by user\n\n// --- Here we have the signature, to be used for any purpose --- \\\\\nsignature = HMACSHA256(\n\tbase64UrlEncode(header) + \".\"+\n\tbase64UrlEncode(payloadData), \n\tbioSecret\n)\n\n\nfunction bioKeyGenerator(bioData){\n\t// Function takes data in the form of user input into their browser or smartphone.\n\t// Data is normalized (explained in Appendix A, not shown here)\n\tbioSecretChecked = bioData;\n\t// Return biosecret \n\treturn sha256(bioSecretChecked)\n}\n\n\n```\nThe notable parts here are the `time-unit` and `userid` in the payload, and the `bioSecret` which is generated by a user's biometric data.\n\nWe have said we web 4 is based on web 3 (blockchain), but this example intentionally used  **web 2 technology**, so the ability to do it is at all begs the question:\n\n\n## Why can't web 2 be used for Time Tokens?\n\nOf course it can! It's just not viable to fulfill all principles of web 4, but can be done to an extent. \n\nWeb 2 is not a viable candidate for **provable democracy** because the federated nature means that your biometric data **must be trusted** to a third party, possibly a government, large corporation or malicious actor. Time tokens do not rely on blockchain technology, but benefit from it to remove trust and add transparency. \n\n___\n# **<center>**2**</center>**\n\n___\n\n# **Proof of Individuality - Biometric Secrets + Protecting Identity**\n> **Please Note:** There are solutions available today (like [FaceTec](https://www.facetec.com/)) that solve the same issues presented here. This paper seeks to outline a \"better\" system (decentralized + open source) that can be ran without a centralized actor, while not providing specifics to accomplish these goals.\n\n**Biometric secrets** are akin to any cryptographic secret key, they are a hash of information. The information hashed in a biometric secret comes from a person's biometric expression. In today's biometric space, static images are most commonly used for things like fingerprint and facial recognition, and geometry is the means to compare this data. \n\nBiometric secrets generated from static images are not secure, as static images can be faked. [2] Video offers a better solution to this problem, as it is harder to fake, can include audio, and lets developers create a whole new set of algorithms based on a changing stream of data. [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/) is one company using video for biometric verification. \n\n### What is used to generate a biosecret?\nThis stream of data (video + audio biometric expression) could be a user doing a series of hand gestures, singing a part of a song, speaking a phrase, speaking a phrase in different voices, clapping, making a series of facial expressions or movements, or anything else one can imagine.\n\nFor security, biometric expressions must be unique (for example, which combination of words to speak) and many types (gesture, singing, clapping) must be available and used in combination. If each person's biometric secret was generated from the same single biometric expression, it would be a matter of time before specific AI could be developed to deepfake it for anyone. If the user is the only one that knows their biometric expressions it becomes nearly impossible to guess the type and nature of the expression, and even if that is known, difficult to use the same technique on more than one account. The nature of the uniqueness could be chosen by the user, or generated at random from the biosecret software which would prompt the user to complete an action in a specific way. \n\n## Why do we need this, again?\nDemocratic systems certainly are being built without biometric verification, and will continue to be until suitable biometric technology develops along the open source, client-side requirements. For now, **decentralized solutions** like [Civic](https://www.civic.com/), and centralized tech like [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/FaceTec_3D_Face_Matching_Whitepaper.pdf) provide the necessary individuality at the cost of trust and requirement of citizenship. As different projects implement web 4 in their own ways, the ideas presented thus far will develop as flaws are found. \n\nWe will present the ideas that are crucial for this system to be different, and represent true growth into web 4.\n\n\n**Key Aspects** \n1. **Biometric Expression**: A user is presented with a choice of different biometric options used to generate a hash that can only belong to this person. \nUser can choose to either perform a chosen biometric task to receive their hashed biosecret (trustless) or generate it at any time from a third-party provider (trust). Any third-party provider will generate the same hash by a set of open-source algorithms. \n\n2. **Biosecret Generation**: User's sensitive biological information and generated algorithmic results are destroyed (made impossible to reconstruct) at the layer of hashing, and data not stored in any way, public or private, as the user runs the software on their local machine (assuming they choose the open-source software, not a third party).\n\nThe biggest issue with biometrics is the lack of trust, mostly due to the growing number of facial recognition softwares and databases. The lack of trust is almost always associated with an individual's lack of consent, not the technology itself. \n\n### To alleviate the trust issue, solutions must be: \n1) open-source\n2) ran entirely on the individual's hardware (client-side), and \n3) not expose any biometric data to any other users or the system itself. \n\nThere will always be **security concerns** with biometrics. For example, if a user uses their biometric secret to unlock their mobile device, another app could be secretly recording the camera in the background. A person could record them doing their secret, and try to play that video back to the camera to gain access. Also, *[deepfakes.](https://github.com/aerophile/awesome-deepfakes)* exist. These concerns must be addressed before this module of web 4 reaches mass adoption. \n\nThe upside of biometric secrets is they **cannot be lost**, and the account will always be recoverable by the individual. In a web 4 ecosystem, where the tokens are distributed daily and often spent daily, a hack would be much less catastrophic. The attacker will be able to access the user's balance, but not alter the past transactions, nor continue to collect the future deposits, because the real user will (in theory) quickly recover the account and change the biometric secret generation means so that the hacker's biofake is no longer working. \n\n___\n# <center>**3**</center>\n\n___\n\n## Degradation of Information\nWeb 3 focuses on storing information forever in a provable way. Web 4 introduces a **counter-model** which may be **optionally** adopted by any time-token-based system. In this model, who did what becomes **harder and harder to know** the more time that passes. \n\nThis idea hinges upon incremental time units, the number of which is used to decide how difficult information about a particular individual is to access. \n\nWith **pseudonymity**, it is difficult, but not impossible, to piece together a story about an individual user by knowing they are responsible for a set of transactions over time. The further back in time a transaction is, the **harder** it is to link it to another transaction with any **certainty**. \n\n## Degradation of Information Fidelity\nInformation fidelity requirements can also be degraded over time. For example, when generating a users biosecret, it can be assumed that the more time that passes, the more the bioinformation of the individual will change. \n\n## Degradation of Biosecrets\n**Biosecrets** are generated from a **range of biometric values**. This range of values can be expanded over time. The effect is, instead of having one hashed biosecret for eternity, the generation process will create a set of biosecrets from an increasingly **wide range of data**. This concept may be needed to keep people in control of their accounts as they age. There is considerable work to be done to develop this concept, as each data type has its own complications. \n\nIn this case, as time goes on, someone attempting to prove their individuality would have to spend a lot **more effort** to run the algorithms against their collected biodata, and the data **precision** needed to match the person's identity is actually **lower**. This is one example of **fidelity change**; others can make it more expensive to change a record from the past, make it harder to find out the ID of a voter, or even limit a past state's effect on the future of a blockchain. \n\n## Proceed with Caution \nWhile the inclusion of this concept into web 4 may seem **unnecessary** at the moment, it is another guarantee of the privacy that is needed for many **social applications**. Philosophically, degradation of information also fits in with the general web 4 desire to reflect [systems in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics). \n\nBefore moving on, I do wish to stress the modularity of web 4, and that this (perhaps the most radical idea presented) is not going to fit into every web 4 system, nor should it. This idea will find its usefulness when it is time, and should NOT be adopted without clear reasoning. \n\n\n___\n# <center>4</center>\n\n___\n# Geo-Social Harmonic Layers\n\nCollaborative social environments are always happening everywhere humans live. Currently, we are both realizing the vast amount of ways to live abundantly, as well as deciding what direction we should be facing to grow as a society. Human growth in the past few centuries has been focused on technological improvements rather than social improvements. [3] To harness the power of the information age for the collaboration of humans, web 4 will be used to enhance, introduce, and replace current structures that organize our societies, which we term geo-social layers. \n\n> Web 4 proposes that systems based in time token are the most apt to create and improve existing social layers. \n\n## What is a Geo-Social Layer?\n\nA geo-social layer is something that affects **people** (social) at a given **location** (Geo). A simple example is the governing body of an area, including all of the legislation. Another example is the customs and culture of a group of people. \n\nThe geo-social layers apt to be improved by web 4 are those which involve **people collaborating**; government/legislation, food and water management, community projects, education, events, charities, environmental protection and much more. \n\n## Geographic Stratification  \nAcross the globe, one geopolitical pattern seems to emerge. Cities are within Counties, are within Districts (States in the USA), are within nations, are within the world. \n\n1. Cities (aka Towns, Commonwealths, etc.)\n2. Counties (aka Divisions\n3. Districts (aka States, Provinces)\n4. Nations (aka Countries, States, Republics, etc)\n5. Global\n\nFor communication, we will consider cities as the \"lowest\" and global as the \"highest\" stratification level.\n \n> Additionally, a **community level** may be added below cities to further add accuracy and usefulness. \n\nFor the purpose of any geo-social system, **geographic association with each actor** must be defined. \n\nTraditionally, it's the existence within a certain area, such as a place of residence or business, that is of importance. When building a geo-social system, it's only necessary that association is declared at the lowest level of geographic stratification, from which the rest can be extrapolated. \n\nBecause each person can be associated to either a community or a city, we can develop systems within web 4 that allow coordination at every strata with just this one piece of data for each person. \n\n# Democracy, Collaboration, and ever-redefining Utopia\n\nBy offering time tokens to the individual that correspond to each stratum we can create **high-fidelity democratic systems** that better represent each and every person's desires. We can know exactly what the people want, with no guesswork, in a very short period of time. \n\nFor example, a person may be given 12 time tokens per month at each stratum to vote on the initiatives that they would like to see passed. They may vote all 12 tokens for an initiative they are most passionate about, or 1 token to 12 different initiatives (or 2 to 6 initiatives, etc). By collecting and counting these tokens, the governing body can **know exactly what their constituents want**, without the direct need to elect a representative who only estimates these desires. \n\nThe democratic system described in this paper does not solve all problems, as there are still issues of voter informedness, unseen actors, and more, but it is a skeleton to build a collaborative social system that are an **improvement to the representative governments** which were once as revolutionary as these ideas are. \n\n\n\n# Roadmap to Web 4 Reality\n\n## **Phase One**\n> Implementing time tokens\n\n**Time Tokens** are implemented on any and all blockchains where developers see the value. These developers provide open-source instructions and tools to helps other developers incorporate time tokens into their applications. \n\n**Provable individuality** for Time Tokens is up to each application and blockchain, and these application can choose to ignore this requirement, risking their systems' integrity. **Federated** (Facetec) and **decentralized** (Civic) options may be used, and so can social verification.\n\n**Information entropy** and **geosocial layers** are starting to be theorized, but not showing up. \n\n**Phase 1 Action Points**: \n- Time Token ERC proposal (and similar for other blockchains)\n- Developers exploring use cases for Time Tokens \n- Developers implementing Time Token in unexpected ways\n\n## **Phase Two**\n> dApps and discovering issues\n\n**Applications using Time Tokens** are widespread, and issues in implementations are becoming known and solved. \n\n**Provable identity** **issues** are becoming apparent, as certain applications with **lax rules** are being manipulated, showing the need for true provable identity. \n\nSocial Verification and solutions like Facetec are still used, while biocryptography standards and biometric secret technology are being developed to allow true provable identity (in Phase Three).\n\n**Information entropy** principles are starting to be implemented, when required.\n\n**Geo-social layers** are starting to be built, but not used for \"real applications\" like voting because of lack of true provable individuality. \n\n**Phase 2 Action Points**: \n- Proposing the best uses for geo-social layers using time tokens\n- Incorporating different provable identity methods\n\n\n## **Phase Three**\n> Implementing Provable Identity\n\n**Provable Identity** is now possible as suggested in this manifesto through the maturity of the biometric secrets. Standards are being created openly, \n\n**GeoSocial layers** are being used to run and govern communities which are not dependent on traditional representative government. Existing governments are adopting time tokens to get a better read on what legislation the people want. \n\n**Phase 3 Action Point**: \n- Creating provable identity solutions that satisfy all requirements\n\n## **Phase Four**\n> Geo-social systems\n\n**Information entropy** is added to the systems where it can be of use. For example, this could make a person's (anonymous) voting record less knowable over time by increasing the amount of CPU time needed to associate one vote with another. \n\n**GeoSocial layers** are being used as a replacement for representative government where it is the will of the people. Voter informedness is measured and known, as are the exact desires of the people. This creates collaboration and a renewed faith in democracy, and a feeling of belongingness and appreciation for each individual. \n\n**Phase 4 Action Points**: \n- Building and operating geo-social layers for the benefit of society and any collaborating group\n- Exploring use cases and integrating information entropy where appropriate\n\n# Author notes\n\n## Change Without Conflict\n**No one can stop us** from building collaborative systems with web 4 and even **self-governing**. **We don't need** to \"tear down the system\" or separate from society to do so. **We can exist** fully embedded in the geopolitical systems around us, while implementing and improving web 4 concepts, the underpinnings of collaborative democracy.\n\nIf and when the \"old system\" meets its demise, as all things do, **we can transition rapidly** to a web 4 system like [Effective Collective](https://github.com/dougbutner/effective-collective) or any other, as it will already be in place. \n\n## Why use the term \"Web 4\"\nIt is my belief that each version of the web must 1) be built on top of the previous version, 2) be fundamentally different than the previous version by introducing new technology, and 3) have meaningful impact on society. \n\nThis proposal for the next iteration of the web is an effort to both expand and shift the path of information science in a direction where the **meaningful impact** of society involves: 1) empowerment of each individual, which serve as the basis for collective (social), economic, and novel applications; 2) provable identity verification while maintaining complete separation from any federated system, including government, with the side-benefit of lifelong recoverability of private keys; and 3) resonance with our contained and containing systems, like our human organs and the Solar system, which provide us with life and free energy daily, akin to free time tokens.\n\nWhile an argument could easily be made that DeFi is Web 4, or another emerging tech, like \"layer 2\" blockchains (rollups) are web 4, both of these are **not new**. DeFi mimics and improves the systems of the past. Rollups are merely making web 3 **more efficient**. \n\nIt is my hope and desire that the information presented here will be **expanded** on and **implemented** by many developers and systems in the coming years, not for the benefit of the few, but for the **empowerment** of each individual and the **harmony** of the human collective, and every layer of Gaia. \n\n___\n# Notes + References\n___\n\n[1] - Solutions like Civic and Facetec have proved to be effective in verifying individuality. KYC services rely on government-issued identification, physical signature, and minimal, often human-checked bioverification. Until the technology is developed for a biometric system resembling the ideas here, these options (as well as social verification) are viable, though not fully embodying the idea of web 4. \n\n[2] - Hao, K. & O'Neill P.

It made me realize I really do need a problem solution section, which I decided not to do at first. I suppose the problem is only obvious to me.

Groups of people organizing, whether to turn a profit as a company, or to live together in a city, are often under-, mis-, or not represented at all in the decision making processes that affect their life. In both of these (governments and companies,) it is the few that make the decisions for the many, even with the illusion of \"having a say\" that exists in a representative system. \n\n# The Solution\nBy providing each individual with equal power in a transparent decision making process, the true intent of the majority can not only be known, it can be acted upon in predetermined ways through smart contracts. Though the solution seems simple, there are issues that will need to be addressed according to the needs of each group of collaborating people, such as ensuring one person per account, and limiting the minting of voting tokens with time, as well as protecting the privacy of decision makers where appropriate. This paper will detail these solutions, though they may not be needed for each system. For example, systems can (and should) be built using time tokens that do not use biometric data at all. \n\n> What the hell is this supposed to mean?\n\nMan, I'm really grateful for your reply. You are right. typo aside, it was a very convoluted message using vocabulary I used in a [different project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2JH9J73WjgZ9-cULJAzrYvZzyPSXEA_fdgt21lHnDc/preview) that has no real context here. So super glad to gut that before publishing. \n\nHere's what I changed it to:\n\n> In essence, web 4 is **collaboration consensus tool** that helps to manifest a shared desire, opinion, or solution by providing a fair system of accounting using time-limited votes, real people, and existing geopolitical stratification.\n\nHow 'bout dat?",
