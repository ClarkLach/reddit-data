Sometimes you just have to do a bit of detective work to figure out what's actually happening.\n\nIf your GTM and GA4 setups aren't too complex, I'd start by searching for \"GA4 Event\" in your GTM container to find all your Google Analytics event tags. Then click into each tag and look for the event name. That's what you'll use to compare against what's showing up in GA4.\n\nOnce you have those event names, hop over to your GA4 admin panel and check the Events section. You should be able to match up the event names from GTM with what's actually firing in GA4.\n\nJust keep in mind that not every GA4 event has to use GTM. Some might be set up directly in GA4, others could be hard-coded into the website, and GA4 automatically fires several standard events that you won't see in GTM at all.\n\nThe Tag Assistant and GTM's debug/preview mode that others mentioned are definitely worth using too.\n\nIf you are taking over management of these the first thing I would do is create a naming scheme for GTM to help identify tags, triggers, and variables quickly.",

Anytime you're adding additional JavaScript / resources there's always going to be a trade off. In my opinion it comes down to what are your business objectives and KPIs.

There are other considerations too, like whether or not your reporting audiences will need to compare data across markets; and whether or not users will know GA4 well enough to filter data. It may not be a concern if each market site is fully contained in each subfolder, but if there's a \"shared\" experience (i.e., set of pages or interactions before the market pages), you would duplicate those events by the number of properties (and their associated traffic). I wouldn't invite the multiple property workflow unless you really have to.\n\nTo make reporting easier for people, you could create a suite of pre-filtered reports. Or, if you're not too worried about sampling, create Looker Studio dashboards for each using report-wide market-specific filters. Easy.\n\n3. Doing so is probably inevitable in the long run, but since it offers no immediate advantage over page path filtering, I'd think though it first. Will there ever be two markets with the same language, or vice versa? If so, you may need dimensions for each to distinguish them, and a new future solution might complicate historical reporting.\n\n4. I'd also (strongly) suggest coding it to the site via a custom dataLayer event that fires on every page, using GTM only to harvest the parameter data via dataLayer variables, add them to the event settings variable, and push the data to GA4. Why? Page path triggers/filters in GTM are delicate and can break silently if the URL changes and the trigger conditions aren't met, or you may want to develop more dimensions than market and be unable to target them in GTM. The coded dataLayer event push might seem daunting, but it's not usually difficult, and is far more scalable. The juice is almost definitely worth the squeeze.",

        "selftext": "UPDATE:  I got a teammate to try GTM preview/debug from a different computer and they also do not see any events in the debug.  I AM seeing some of the URLs I hit in realtime, but like 20-30 minutes later, and not 100 percent consistent.  Is lag in 'real time' stats a thing?  \n  \nI am trying to debug some missing custom events in GA4 (custom events are firing in GTM but not being reflected in GA4) but using GTM preview and debug mode in GA4, **I seem to be invisible.**  Also when I use incognito or another browser using an easily identifiable URL, my sessions do not seem to show up all the time in the real time overview or pages.  Is there any known common reason for this?  Some notes on what I have tried:\n\nVerified GTM container is firing GA4 and custom events as expected and sending to the right data stream\n\nVerified that the pages in question are tagged with GA4 according to GA4\n\nThe GA4 property is on an active website and is showing realistic user traffic and events for the most part.\n\nI've deactivated all data filters on the GA4 account\n\nEverything is set up to work properly and SEEMS to be working properly, yet I am constantly unable to verify anything through debug or real time view in GA4.  GTM preview tells me all events are firing as expected and sending to the right container but I should see them in debug or rt right?\n\nI will check in 24 hours to see if my test events and the uncommon urls I was hitting are populated in reporting, but I feel like I should not be a ghost on the site in real time... What's going on?",

Latency is unpredictable and GA4 will often not show any details of a specific event when drilling down into it, likely because of privacy restrictions (GA4 gets twitchy about thresholds because you might be able to identify the user that created the event).\n\nDebug view… a few months back I forgot it was even a thing. I just don’t use it.\n\nWhat I do use is Chrome dev tools network tab, because if I see events going out to GA4 from that view, I’m signing off on a job well done.\n\nIf server-side GTM is involved, I’ll maybe look at the outbound server hit from sGTM preview as a peace-of-mind measure, but generally I’m satisfied if the hit in Chrome network view is visibly reaching sGTM.",

        "selftext": "Hey there! Looking for community input on our Google Analytics setup for a nonprofit. I've done some research but I'd love to run it by you all for any advice and thoughts. Thank you in advance!\n\n**Our Setup:**\n\n* Main web application (authenticated users) on maindomain.com\n   * Our web app can push custom user data to dataLayer\n* Login page on login.maindomain.com (separate codebase, legacy setup)\n* WordPress marketing site on marketingdomain.com (public/ no authentication)\n\n**Our Goals:**\n\n1. Marketing team needs a GA property for general usage analysis\n2. Data team needs a separate GA property with curated events for a BigQuery export\n3. Engineering team needs a testing property for new tags from our web application\n\n**What I’m thinking for setup:**\n\n* **GTM Containers (2):**\n   * Container A: Web application (main.domain.com) \n   * Container B: WordPress marketing site \n      * Also to be fed by login.maindomain.com (while I know that this flow is technically part of the user flow for the application use itself, I am thinking of including it with the Wordpress site’s GTM container since 1) the tags themselves will be similar in that these users are all unauthentificated and 2) I’d like to keep the Web application container as clean as possible, only being fed by the maindomain.com codebase if possible. I would love to know any thoughts here! I am probably missing some limitations that would arise in doing this.).\n* **GA Properties (3):**\n   * **Testing Property**:\n      * New tags from web app before promotion (and that promotion just means changing the destination of the tag’s data via a change to the tag’s measurement/property stream ID).\n   * **Marketing Property**:\n      * All functioning tags from both sites\n      * Enhanced Measurement ON\n      * cross-domain tracking domains list: maindomain.com and marketingdomain.com\n   * **BigQuery Property**:\n      * Curated events only\n      * Enhanced Measurement OFF\n      * cross-domain tracking domains list: maindomain.com and marketingdomain.com\n\n**Some questions:**\n\n1. Does this container and property division make sense? And, specifically any additional thoughts on how login.maindomain.com should be handled?\n2. For the BigQuery property, I'm planning to duplicate certain desired tags in the GTM containers and pointing them to my BigQuery Property. Is this the right approach?\n3. For cross-domain tracking, I read [here](https://www.analyticsmania.com/post/cross-domain-tracking-in-google-analytics-4/) that Google handles subdomains automatically now. I am reading this as that I do NOT need to add my subdomain (login.myapplicationdomain.com) to my list of configured domains in my tag settings for my property streams, is this correct? And, would I still need to make sure my GTM container code (for Container B) is included in login.myapplicationdomain.com’s code?\n\nAny feedback on this approach or things I'm missing? Thanks again!",

A little background/context.\n\n  \nWithin GTM we are using a lookup table to passthrough the unique Measurement ID based on domain. This is working correctly as our several GA4 properties are collecting data via this method.\n\n  \nI have built out the backend of our website code to pass and push some custom variables. for example \"current\\_population\". Via GTM preview and debugging I'm able to see these variables populated on the website and working as expected. I've also added these parameters and their corresponding values into the GA4 configuration tag. I did this two days ago. I also added in GA4 matching custom definitions. With all that said when I build out a custom Explore report and import these dimensions, and add them as Rows, the data is blank. I've validated my work in ChatGPT and Gemini and they both say everything is set up correctly.\n\nDoes anyone have an experience with this or a way to solve this? Happy to share some screenshots if needed.\n\n  \nTYIA.",

        "selftext": "**To conduct a proper analysis, I need to structure event fields in a very detailed way.** My site is highly multifunctional, with various categories and filters, so it’s crucial to capture the primary ID of each object to link the web data with our database (which contains hundreds of tables).\n\nFor example, for each event I must:\n\n* Distinguish the type of action (e.g., viewing a modal form, viewing a page, clicking).\n* Include the primary ID (if one exists).\n* Include a “log type” so I know which table or entity in the database the ID corresponds to.\n* Specify the type of page (to differentiate between routes leading to conversion or activation).\n* In certain cases, identify the type of web element (e.g., if one page type has multiple ways to perform an action).\n\n**Option A** is to configure all these events and parameters directly in Google Tag Manager (GTM), then export to BigQuery via GA4. But this approach requires complex JavaScript variables, extensive regex lists, and other tricky logic. It can become unwieldy, risk performance issues, and demand a lot of ongoing work.\n\n**Option B** is to track broader events by storing raw data (e.g., `click_url`, `click_element`, `page_location`, etc.), then export that to BigQuery and run a daily transformation script to reshape the raw data as needed. This strategy lets me keep the original data and store different entities in different tables (each with its own parameters), but it increases BigQuery usage and costs, and makes GA4 less useful for day-to-day analytics.\n\n**Question:** Which approach would you choose? Have you used either of these methods before?",

Also, dynamic Sort and Filter features can also be difficult to impossible to target in GTM (think iFrame); I'd definitely confirm those as well.\n\nIf you have developer resources, you might consider an Option C: code dataLayer events, then use GTM to configure dataLayer variables, tags, and triggers to grab that data and send it GA4/BigQuery. This is the workflow I've seen in every job, but most have been larger org/stores.\n\nHow I read it, any solution for what you're describing is going to require a fair amount initial and ongoing work in GTM.

If the purchase event is what's being fired via an event outside of GTM, it's most likely a timing issue.\n\nI would avoid doing it this way unless absolutely necessary. You can use custom GTM events to accomplish pretty much anything you'd do with gtag events, and assuming that you've structured the ecommerce data in the recommended way it's pretty trivial to reformat the events to send to GTM instead with minimal additional setup required (you can use \"Send ecommerce data\" instead of manually adding all the parameters).",

We have built out sending GA4 events on element/button clicks, pages loading and purchase events when receipt pages are loaded. So, we ask for clients' GA4 key, we load that into their site, and all these GA4 events we have built get sent directly to their GA4 account. \n\nWe also offer the option to load a GTM key into the clients' website if given to us. This gives them the option to tag stuff and create events that maybe we didn't build out with direct GA4 events mentioned above. They, of course, can load in script logic, etc. through GTM too. \n\nThat is why the option of loading in GTM and GA4 occurs. But, your comment about potential timing issues, the dataLayer being over written, etc. are great points that I can bring to the table to work on dis-allowing GTM + GA4 begin loaded together.",

That does make it more complicated if you can't be 100% sure if the client has a container. \n\nThough, given that container setup can be templated, it also presents you with a potential upsell if you can require them to have GTM. Create a template container where you use a constant variable to add the tag ID to each GA4 tag, and all you'll generally have to do for setup for a new client is export that template container, import it to a new container, and edit the constant with that client's tag ID.\n\nThere's also no concept of ownership in GTM, so it doesn't matter if you create the container and give them access. I would recommend going the GTM route if possible, as it'd make things cleaner and gives total control over tag timing.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend:\n\n* Only fire one GA4 config per page, either via GTM (my reco) or via an on-page gtag, but not both\n   * Any gtag events that try to fire before the config is loaded will most likely fail\n* Place GTM as high as possible in the head (but not before the gtag 'consent', 'default' call if you're implementing Google Consent Mode)\n* If you have to do anything GA4-related above GTM in the head, add this immediately before your GTM script in order to avoid overwriting the dataLayer (which the gtag also uses):\n   * <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || \\[\\]; </script> \n   * Note that you can just add that regardless with no downside",

Google calls this pixel a Google Tag, and it will look something like G-xxxxxx. Go to GTM and fire it on all pages, presumably like you did for Meta. \n\nFrom there,\n- for GA4 you can create events directly in GTM (no initial event configuration required within GA4, you just start building in GTM)\n- for GAds, you’ll need to follow the conversion setup flow within GAds before you receive a conversion ID, conversion action, and conversion label. That information will need to be put in a tag in GTM (along with whatever triggering conditions apply).",

I was able to successfully set up the triggers for multiple buttons on a single page (not the homepage) and create a tag that appears to be sending the events to GA4.\n\nBut now I'm trying to figure out how to set up a trigger for a buttons on other pages, as well as hopefully one trigger for the main CTA in the top nav. Here are my questions:  \n  \n1. Do I need to set up a separate trigger (or even event tag) for every page? Or can I add a trigger fires from other pages to the same Trigger I used on the single page?\n\n2. If I add a trigger fire to the top nav button, will that fire when people click the button from any page, or do I need to do it separately for every page?\n\n3. Do I need a separate tag for button triggers for forms?\n\nApologies if some of this doesn't make sense...this all seemed pretty easy for setting up buttons on a single page but now I'm kind of lost and most of the YouTube videos I've found are for setting up the event for a single button.\n\n",

Without additional configuration of your event tag you will not be able to tell which elements caused the event to fire in GA4.\n\nYou really have two options here.\n\n- Option 1 (not recommended) -\n\nCreate an event to handle every single element that can be clicked on and have it fire off a “click element - all clicks” trigger.\n\nIn the event setup, create a parameter to send along with the event that will help you distinguish between different elements. An example might be the text of the element so you could create a parameter called “clickText” and send it along with the event using the inbuilt GTM variable [Click Text] as the value.\n\nYou will need to add clickText as a custom definition in the GA4 admin as well otherwise the parameter won’t be recorded with the event (even if it does show up in debug mode)\n\nI don’t recommend this method as it is a lot of extra work for you when reading reports to dive in to the event and look at the parameters to work out what was clicked on.\n\n- Option 2 (recommended) -\n\nCreate a unique event for each specific element you want to track using specific “click element - some clicks” triggers. You will need to configure triggers for each event to ensure they only trigger for the elements you want each event to fire for. You may need to use multiple variables for targeting such as click class, click url and click text.\n\nWith this approach you can then create plain English event names such as “Button - Contact”, “Button - Back to Top”, “Button - Click to Call”, etc. Now when you look at the events in GA4 you can tell from the event name what element was clicked.\n\nYou can go further too. Say you have multiple contact buttons on the site and most of the time you don’t care which contact button was clicked, just that a contact button was clicked. Then you could make an event that fires on all contact buttons and send along parameters with the event (as in option 1) which distinguish between them (note: If the only distinguishing feature between each button is the page it is on, you don’t need to do that as GA4 automatically captures the page any event is fired on). This means you can still very quickly see the amount of total contact button clicks while still being able to dig deeper when needed and find out which clicks happened on which contact buttons.\n\nI hope the above helps.\n\nEdit: Oh and to answer question number two, if your trigger doesn’t include a page URL in its conditions then that trigger will fire on any matching event no matter what page it is on (in case that wasn’t clear from my explanation).",

        "selftext": "I've been looking at event data and I'm finding that the numbers just don't add up. By a fairly wide margin.\n\nI have a list of third party websites on my site. When a user clicks one of them, they are presented with a modal HTML popup to acknowledge that they're going to visit a third-party website. If they click OK, a new tab opens with the website in it. If they click Cancel, the modal popup closes. Once the popup is showing, they can't take any other actions on the site (aside from closing the window, refreshing, the Back button, etc).\n\nPreviously, I was just tracking which link was clicked but found that the value recorded in GA was \"(not set)\" or blank much more frequently than I would have expected. So I set up three tags/triggers in GTM to diagnose the issue. Each tag/trigger captures the name of the action (in event\\_action) and the link that the user clicked (in event\\_label). The first tag/trigger is on the initial link click, the second one tracks if the user clicks OK and the third one tracks if the user clicks Cancel. Theoretically, the total of OK and Cancel clicks should be close to the number of link clicks. If nothing else, logically, it should never be *more* since the user can't get to the OK and Cancel buttons without first clicking a link.\n\nBut looking at my data from yesterday, I show 57 instances of the initial link being clicked, 9 instances of the user clicking Cancel but **85 instances** of visitors clicking OK to proceed to the website.\n\nI'm stumped. How could I have more instances of an event that can't happen until the initial link is clicked.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts?",

To see the actual data you have to connect BigQuery.\n\nAnd to throw another wrench in GA4 explore reporting, I've been experiencing reports being sampled to hell. I just did one the other day, Explore reported 16 clicks on a particular button - BigQuery with the same exact filters reported over 600 clicks. Explore warned the sample size was less than 10% so I imagine that's the discrepancy. Granted, this is a site that gets a fairly large volume of traffic.\n\nUltimately, validate your tagging is working, especially across desktop and mobile, and the most common browsers.

May I ask which platform your website is built on? Most ecommerce platforms offer a direct integration with GA4 and/or GTM. Depending on the platform that you're using, you may be better off using the platform's native GA4 integration.\n2. Any particular reason why you want to create the event in GA4 instead of GTM?\n3. Do you have the GTM script added to your site anyway? I ask this question because I would still use Tag Assistant GTM preview to debug and test the solution we put in place\n\nIf I were to create this event in GA4, I would probably do it like this:\n\nevent name: order\\_button\\_clicks\n\nMatching conditions:\n\n* event\\_name **equals** click or gtm.linkClick\n* page\\_location **contains** (insert the specific URL where the order button is placed)\n* link\\_url contains (the URL that you land on after clicking the button)\n* link\\_text contains Order\n   * I wouldn't use link\\_text but if you need an extra matching condition to differentiate this event and another event.. you can use the CTA text here. CTA buttons are tested for performance all the time, especially important buttons like the one to place your order. It can be easy to forget that someone suggested last month to change it from Order to Order Now, as an example, and the event would stop working.\n\ndon't forget to test this using Tag Assistant - that will tell you what to do for the first matching condition, click or gtm.linkClick",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been testing and trying to set up an AB test for a while now and I'm failing again and again so I decided to post a question and hopefully receive some hints on how to achieve this.\n\nMy current implementation uses gtag.js to send a custom event `experience_impression` to GA4 with custom parameters `exp_variant_string` as per this guide by Google [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/integration).\n\nI've followed these steps so far:\n\n1. Implemented the gtag into my code;\n\n2. Created the `experience_impression` tag in GTM (Google Tag Manager) with the `exp_variant_string` parameter with a default value of '`template_variant`';\n\n3. Tested the newly created tag with GTA (Google Tag Assistant) and ensured it is firing:\n\n[GTA event trigger details](https://preview.redd.it/plf0z4olsy7e1.png?width=1724&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c4f8869fd24acafd8bad53f7d7953517eb3d6f2)\n\n4. Created the event in GA4, marked it as a key event and ensured it is being recorded by checking the realtime overview:\n\n[GA4 live report](https://preview.redd.it/ysqggehmty7e1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c8683e20437cfdb1606ba6225895f74685c55f6)\n\n  \nSo far, my setup is supposed to work, but I have two main problems:\n\na. I cannot figure out how to pass the `exp_variant_string` programatically. I'm currently using JavaScript to send the parameters with the gtag.js\n\n[Current setup is wrapped in a fn that can create consistent names for different web pages I have based on wether user's assigned variant, as per the suggested format from the docs by Google for developers I provided above](https://preview.redd.it/q4i6ocacuy7e1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bf5e913d60ffc2fbfe3b12200d5a1b5987a6910)\n\nhowever, this does not seem to work. As you can see in the screenshot from GTM, the parameters are not being passed at all (or so I think) and I'm not even sure how to find them in GA4. I've even tried removing the default parameter, but then nothing shows up at all and I'm not sure why - I have to create a custom dimension matching this parameter in GA4? How?\n\n[Variables tab from GTA](https://preview.redd.it/muadhu9puy7e1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a52076cc3f730b0129e8317d5876ce4b1a1a97)\n\nb. How can I create a GA4 audience that checks for the `exp_variant_string` parameter's value rather than an event? I basically want to use eventName.parameterValue as a filter for my audience, where eventName is `experience_impression` `and parameterValue is experience_impression`'s `exp_variant_string`.\n\n\n\nI might have missed or misunderstood some things so sorry in advance, but I could not find any straight-forward guide on how to set this up. If there's any guides you can share, that'd also be super handy!\n\nThank you in advance.",

When debugging with the Tag Assistant, you have to check the Data Layer tab and get the name of the parameter from there (this way you're also testing and ensuring that it is being sent).\n\nAfter doing this, when creating the tag in GTM, simply go to parameters, add that same variable name to the parameter, and set the variable you've just created as the value to be stored with that parameter. Next time you're testing with the Tag Assistant and your tag fires, you should be able to confirm the data is transmitted properly by checking 'see as values' instead of seeing the variable name.\n\nYou've made sure through Tag Assistant testing that the events are properly sent - now in GA4.

However, in practice this doesn’t always work the way we want, depending on how your users flow, whether your site is a single page app, how you are utilizing the UTMs, etc. For example, if a user clicks on a Google ad and lands on the site, then clicks an on-site banner that has a UTM campaign on it that directs the user to a different page on the same hostname, the UTM will appear in the navigation bar, however, this session won’t be attributed to the banner in reporting. This is because the session was attributed to the Google ad. \n\nCurious how others deal with this, but there are at least a few ways to try and address this that I can think of.\n\n1. Use a different UTM. Campaign is a native UTM that gets treated differently. If it’s easy to use a unique one, then you can pass it in the config tag and report on it separately.\n\n2. Include this in both the config tag AND event tags where you specifically want this data included. This will ensure it’s always present where you expect it to be. If you only rely on the config tag, there are scenarios where events can fire out of order, and the config param could be populated as blank or (not set). Including your param in both should help minimize those scenarios. Adding these to all event tags gets time consuming, so take a look at the event tag setting variables. You can create them once & apply to all event tags. Just make sure you only include event params you are OK being applied to all events if you do that.\n\n3. Of course there’s the obligatory “just use big query”, but that’s becoming a catch-all phrase on this sub for any issue with GA4, and often lacks specificity on how exactly to use BQ to solve the problem. \n\n4. Don’t rely on GTM debug view for anything ever. It regularly shows data being collected that is not going to be available in reporting. Sounds like you’re reviewing network calls. That’s the correct way to ensure data capture & transmission.",

If you have a custom event with the name page\\_view, then every time that event is triggered, Google will read it as a second view of the same page that GA4 has already counted. The DOUBLES the page view, session, and user count metrics. \n\nI don't see a way to use the Google Tag tag in GTM with stock page\\_view disabled, so I don't see a way to make a custom Event with name = page\\_view without this double counting. \n\nWe made this mistake because we misunderstood the event name parameter. We thought we were adding our custom dimensions to an existing event named page\\_view; no, we were added a second page\\_view with custom dimensions. Instead, the custom dimensions event can be named anything. The name does not matter, the custom dimensions are added to the session anyway, because custom event parameters are always added to the current session, regardless of event name.",

So I'm starting with a small ads campaign.\n\n\n\nWe've been running GA4 tag in Shopify, which I believe I set up correctly even before the UA tag was deprecated. So I believe our Analytics data is correct.\n\n\n\nI was trying to use GTM, which looks like it's causing multiple fires of events. But I think I have multiple fires in addition to GTM. I'm seeing way more events fired than I should be seeing for both the Google Ads and the other traffic sources.\n\n\n\nFor example, when I look at Analytics --> Life cycle--> Engagement --> Events I see:\n\nEvent count: 44,745 (100% of total)\n\nTotal users: 3,838 (100% of total) -- this might be right. But in Google Ads this number is way higher.\n\nEvent count per active user: 11.79 (Avg 0%)\n\nTotal revenue: $947.10 (100% of total) -- I confirmed this is correct between Shopify and Google Analytics.\n\nFor traffic we get high engagement and multiple page views on Organic traffic to the store as showing in Analytics.\n\n\n\nThe event tag that I think is from GTM is ads\\_conversion\\_Shopping\\_Cart\\_1 has 10x the fires than the purchase event shows.\n\n\n\nBut before I installed GTM I wasn't getting any conversion reporting. \n\n\n\nI think I need to remove GTM and start over. At this point I don't mind that I will lose data. I want to build a set up that will use Google Ads, GTM, and Google Analytics that will fire right and once confirmed we can scale.\n\n\n\nCan anyone comment on how to proceed? Thanks.",

I would agree then on re-setting up your tracking here.  \n  \nUsually, when you are using the Shopify-GA4 native integration, there is no more need to use Google Tag Manager as this might only cause double counting depending on the tags set up within your GTM. I assume you are using GTM for your Google Ads conversion tracking on Shopify? If yes, then why not do away with GTM and just use imported conversions from GA4 to Google Ads and then use those for reporting and optimization goals? This is something you can start off with and see if it works for you.",

Any and all advice is appreciated.  \nOne of my clients is a franchise; all of the locations/traffic is being sent to one website. Because of this, there is one GA4 account that is used to keep up with everything and we typically segment traffic per campaign using UTMs.\n\nThe client is very keen on being able to attribute what purchases are coming from what advertising channels. They recently switched booking platforms and now utilize MBO with a custom solution widget. I set up cross domain tracking in GA4 between the website and the booking URL., but now it seems as thought the GLID is being stripped halfway through the booking so it's not attributing to a campaign via UTM.\n\n  \n I've worked with the dev team in getting the dataLayer set up to send over everything I need to GA4 from each purchase - Item Name, Price, and Quantity. In GA4 I'm able to see all of the purchases coming in, but, since all locations share the same website and GA4, I'm unable to see what purchases are coming from which advertising channels or to which location.\n\n  \nI worked with the dev team again and created individual GA4 properties for each of the booking sites (each location has their own). I then added the GA4 for the original site as a second data stream to some of the properties to test how things would flow through. It seems to be working, and it should give me what I'm needing. However, I feel as though there is a better/easier way for this to be done. If anyone has any insight or feedback I'd greatly appreciate hearing it.",

With no banner, they're still taking a risk.\n\nThat's because banners use Consent Mode, which requires the default consent initialization tag from Google Tag Manager to fire BEFORE anything on the screen is drawn.   (Google even created a new tag to allow this to happen).\n\nBy the time the directly placed GTM script is run, Drupal is well under way with the screen.  That means that the default tag fires out of order, and either Google will think that you didn't get consent from your users during this time to analyze their data (most probable), or it overwrites consent that the user previously gave (less probable).   As a result, analytics data is partially or totally lost.\n\nThis timing problem is why the Drupal community created the GTM module: it is built to allow the initialization tags to fire at the right times.   But caution with the GTM module because some past versions contained some terrible bugs which have caused significant damages in lost data and lost time trying to diagnose the problem.   (We know because it happened to us)\n\nDon't be scared, just make sure you perform all updates and understand what you're installing and you'll be fine.",

        "selftext": "I will be so grateful for anyone that can help with this issue. Below is a more detailed description of the problem I am having.\n\nI am trying to set up an RFI form submission event. I already have a form\\_submit event in GTM that is being pushed to GA4 for all form submissions on my site. Now I am setting up a separate event specifically for RFI form submissions that I plan to mark as a conversion in GA4. \r  \n\r  \nI have created a custom event in GA4 that fires when event name equals form\\_submit and the form\\_id equals the id of my RFI form. I then tested it using the preview mode in GTM and looked for the new event to fire in the debug mode of GA4. Not only did the new event not show up in GA4 debug, the generic form\\_submit event did not show up either. \r  \n\r  \nI can't fathom why the form\\_submit event was not sent to GA4 since the tag fired perfectly fine looking on the GTM side. The form\\_submit event has been working for all other form submissions that I have tested before and since, but it will not send to GA4 for this RFI form for some reason.\r  \n\r  \nI tried recreating the RFI form submission custom event from GA4 in GTM and set it up to send to GA4 to see if it would work that way, or if I could at least see what the issue was. But, once again, this tag fired perfectly fine in GTM but is not showing up in GA4 debug mode.\r  \n\r  \nI've double checked that the I am using the correct GA4 container in the GTM tags and that the event names match up and haven't found any issues. Has anyone else encountered an issue like this, or does anyone have any ideas on what I might be doing wrong? I'm fully prepared for this to be something simple and small that I have overlooked, but I've been searching for a long time and I can't fathom why this event won't show in GA4.",

It's a good point to check that more closely though. I will double check that the event is set up the exact same way as the corresponding event in UA and let them both run for a full day and compare the numbers.",

I'm not sure what needs amending or removing. \n\nThey have a Google Analytics global site tag that has a UA code on their website. Their UA analytics is connected to their GA4 and is showing all their events correctly. \n\nThey also have a GTM account, but it's not installed on their site, and have one legacy UA tag that is tracking one of their key events in GA4. \n\nSo, I was wondering do I need to replace the UA global site tag code with the GA4 version? Does the GTM code need to be added to their site? And does the UA legacy tag need to be replaced with a GA4 event tag?  \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, thanks. ",

        "author": "ForeverSarcastic",
        "id": "1auwavm",
        "selftext": "Would love some help with some ongoing issues I'm having on GA4. Long story short:\n\n1. I didn't really have anything to do with GA/any experience using it until the end of 2023, after the migration to GA4 from UA. My background is as a content writer but hey, we're a small scrappy startup, so sometimes I get thrown a wild card here and there. \n2. I have been asked to confirm that conversions are being tracked correctly in GA4 - for historical data, so we know what we're tracking on an ongoing basis is correct.\n3. My company's GA setup was created years ago, well before my time, with no documentation.\n4. I'm seeing what appears to be multiple versions of different tags/containers firing on different sites, and can't figure out what feeds into what. This is arguably the most confusing thing for me.\n5. From what I understand, the trigger for a specific conversion event (the most important one for me) actually occurs server-side - so I guess we're using both GTM/GA4 as well as some kind of server-side implementation.\n6. There's a hell of a lot of data that shows up as (none) or (unassigned) or other tags that don't lead anywhere. Exploring any of this via the user view, and it doesn't look like there's much in each individual user profile to connect the dots.\n7. We also track customer data on GA4, for some reason (i.e. we track peoples' actions in our web app's backend, as well as behavior on the marketing site)\n8. There's all sorts of random tags and old data left around the system and on our website and I have no idea how to decipher them. I've tried dozens of approaches and still get the same numbers which are missing lots of data/fields with seemingly no pattern.\n9. We also have some custom events/dimensions set up, but there's no indication of what makes them trigger.\n10. If I can prove that the missing data is gone forever as it was never set up, and we need to start from scratch going forwards, that's completely fine. I just don't understand how I can be sure one way or the other.\n\nBasically, all I want to know is how I can come up with a concrete number for conversions that follow this journey:\n\n1st entry to our site via organic search, with details on the referring URL i.e. google > landing page is anything on our standard domain > they trigger the conversion event. As far as I know, the conversion event can only be triggered on one page on the site, so once we know where it started, we're fine. It's just the directly attributable journey from organic search that seems impossible. Half the data (source/medium/hostname etc) seems to be missing from people who triggered the record.\n\nWould appreciate any help here - I'm pulling my hair out over this. Suggested to the team starting from scratch with Matomo, but they don't want to put 2x JS tags on the site to avoid slowing it down, and also would rather harness a free existing solution than convert to something paid, which makes sense from a business perspective.\n\nAnything pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.",

                "body": "This sounds like you’re about to become the subject matter expert for GA4, GTM. Cleaning up & mapping your tags (documenting what is being tracked) is priority 1. \n\nCheck to see if the same GA4 property tag is implemented via GTM and hardcoded. If a migration happened, make sure they didn’t duplicate a property tag.\n\nServer side and client side tagging as a combo is very common. Some tracking can only be done client-side. It’s typical for 3rd party tags (I.e Google, FB, Bing, Floodlight, etc.) and DB driven events like a purchase to have server-side. \n\nLook for cross-domain tracking. If there’s multiple containers, there are probably multiple GA4 properties, but again, if a migration happened with no documentation, check to see if any of those are empty. If I were to track multiple domains today, I’d do so with a single container & cross-domain tracking. Some vendors I’ve had requested their own GTM container to be installed, but that’s rare and weird.\n\nCustom dimensions should be within your event and config tags in GTM. Check there to see what parameters are being passed to GA, then you’ll have an idea of what triggers them (or is supposed to trigger them).\n\nYou may go into tag manager and look for unused tags (tags with no triggers), unused variables (variables that are not used in any tags), and unused triggers (triggers not used in any tags). If you find any of these, they should be safe to delete or ignore. It can be helpful to label these as “historic” in the naming convention.\n\nOnce this stuff has been done, follow the same path you’re looking to track - Google > landing page > conversion event. While doing so, have the debug tool running & check the params that are passing each step of the way. The first pageview event should have a session source/medium. You can also check chrome dev tools and look for “collect”. This JS will show what’s passing to GA from your session. I’ve had instances where everything looked fine in the debug tool, but data was not passing in the collect statement.",

        "selftext": "I am using GTM on our Product Cart website to fire a GA4 event tag called Product Cart Purchase, with the event name `purchase_from_cart`. When users complete a purchase, they are redirected to a page on the site with `/designer-download` in the URL path, and the query string contains all the info I need for the ecommerce analysis.  Instead of using the data layer, I have defined custom variables using the URL query string and composed a custom Javascript variable called `ecommerce_object` .\n\nIn the Ecommerce configuration of this tag, I have `Send Ecommerce Data` checked, with the `Data source` as `Custom Object`, `Ecommerce Object` is the value of the `{{ecommerce_object}}`, and the `ecommerce_object` value is generated like this:\n\n    function() {\n        return {\n            transaction_id: {{transaction_id}},\n            value: {{signup_revenue}},\n            currency: \"USD\",\n            items: [\n                {\n                item_id: {{product_id}},\n                item_name: {{item_name}},\n                currency: \"USD\",\n                price: {{signup_revenue}}\n                }\n            ]\n        };\n    }\n\nThe values `{{transaction_id}}`, `{{signup_revenue}}`, `{{product_id}}` are derived from the query parameters, and `{{item_name}}` is derived from another Javascript custom variable translating the `{{product_id}}` to a string naming the product.  But when I look at the Monetization: Ecommerce Purchase report in Google Analytics, it has no data.\n\nHere's what I've tried:\n\n* GTM preview: Verifies that the tag is firing at the appropriate time and that the parameter values are populated correctly, including the \\`ecommerce\\_object\\`\n* GA4 debug view: Shows the \\`product\\_cart\\_purchase\\` event firing with the parameter values intact.\n* My ecommerce object has the minimum required data for ecommerce analysis: transaction id, value, currency, array of item objects, and each item object has product id, item name and price.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nPlease and thank you.",

It looks like the tag fires as expected.\n\nI've confirmed that my internal IP filter is inactive.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nEdit: There seems to be two issues. Addressing them both may have solved things. First, both GA4 and GTM code were embedded in the site, so things were being double-counted. Also, the RegEx code in the trigger would sometimes allow the trigger to fire, but sometimes it wouldn't. I decided to just remove it. I may get additional, unintended counts of thank-you page conversions, but from what I can tell, there just isn't a super-predictable way of tracking form submissions that will fire consistently. If I'm wrong, I'd love to know something that works all the time! For now, I'm going with what I've got, and I'll tweak when GA4 presents new / better options.\n\n&#x200B;",

The text documentation specifies using the \"Initialization - All pages\" trigger. However, the video on the same page specifies using the \"Page View - All pages\" trigger. Our web developer suggested using the \"Initialization - All pages\" trigger because he said they've seen numerous issues with the \"Page View\" trigger since GA4 no longer uses pageview events like UA did. I'm going to try switching the trigger to see if that fixes the problem, but I'm concerned about creating other issues if using \"Page View - All pages\" has been a problem for other people.\n\nThank you!\n\n\\[1\\] [https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9442095?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9442095?hl=en) ",

                "body": "It sounds like you're experiencing issues with tracking sessions and pageviews in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) through Google Tag Manager (GTM). Let's address your concerns step by step:\n\n**Session Not Immediately Appearing in Realtime Reports:** It's not uncommon for sessions to take a short while (a few minutes) to appear in the realtime reports of GA4. However, if there's a significant delay or if sessions don't appear at all without navigating to another page, it could indicate an issue with your implementation.\n\n**Cookie Consent Banner:** Since you mentioned you accepted the cookie consent banner terms long ago, it's unlikely that this is causing the issue. Consent preferences are usually stored in cookies, and if you've already given consent, it should not affect the immediate session tracking.\n\n**GA4 Configuration in GTM:** The \"Initialization - All Pages\" trigger is the recommended trigger type for initializing the GA4 configuration on all pages of your website. This trigger ensures that the GA4 tracking code is consistently executed across your site. The \"Page View - All Pages\" trigger might still work, but using \"Initialization - All Pages\" is the recommended and more reliable approach for GA4.\n\n**Discrepancy in Google Documentation:** Discrepancies in documentation can sometimes occur due to updates, changes, or different use cases. Using the \"Initialization - All Pages\" trigger is the correct approach for GA4. Since you're encountering issues with sessions not being immediately tracked, it's worth trying the \"Page View - All Pages\" trigger to see if it resolves the issue, but do keep in mind that it might not be the ideal solution.\n\nTo troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n**Check Tag Configuration:** Ensure that your GA4 tag configuration in GTM is correct. Double-check your GA4 Measurement ID and other settings.\n\n**Test in Different Browsers:** Test the behavior across different browsers to see if the issue is specific to a particular browser.\n\n**Check for JavaScript Errors:** Use your browser's developer tools to check for any JavaScript errors that might be interfering with the GA4 tracking code.\n\n**Review GTM Preview:** Use GTM's preview mode to see if the GA4 tag is firing correctly and if there are any issues reported.\n\n**Session Timeout:** GA4 has a session timeout period. If a user lands on your site, performs no actions, and leaves, it might not trigger a session if the session timeout is not reached.\n\n**Page Load Time:** If your landing page has a very short load time and a user leaves quickly, the session might not be tracked. GA4 requires a minimum amount of time for a session to be counted.\n\n**Cache Issues:** Cached versions of your site might not trigger the GA4 tag. Clear your browser cache and test again.\n\n**Check Network Requests:** In your browser's developer tools, monitor the network requests to see if the GA4 tracking request is being sent when you land on the page.\n\nIf switching to the \"Page View - All Pages\" trigger resolves the issue, it might indicate a specific behavior of your site or a potential bug in GA4's current implementation. However, it's always a good idea to follow the recommended practices whenever possible.",

        "id": "16eyi73",
        "selftext": "\n\n\n\nFrom what I know, GTM’s <head> snippet is the main snippet to track websites users. The <body> snippet is only there as a backup to track users that do not load Javascript on their browser, which to my understanding almost everyone’s browser loads JS. The body snippet can help in that case, but other than that it’s not actually necessary. Please correct me if I’m mistaken. \n\nThe reason why I’m asking whether I can leave out the <body> script is because I’ve been getting a lot of pageviews with the url as gtm-msr.appspot.com on my analytics tools, and it’s messing up my analytics. Looking at the user screen recording, it shows my website even though these urls are gtm-msr.appspot.com. That URL is Google’s URL to load a frame over my website for browsers that don’t support JS, which is what the <body> snippet is for. Basically these are bots landing on my website and leaving almost immediately, driving up numbers I don’t want to track for a URL that isn’t mine. \n\nThis is affecting my analytics tools, and website recording tools, my ads tools, etc etc. I can add a line of code for every tag saying to only load when its my website’s URL and not gtm-msr.appspot.com. But this is not ideal because a lot of my tags on GTM use templates so I can’t edit the HTML. \n\nSo I was thinking, if only bots are using the <body> snippet to load GTM, and it’s messing up my data, and I don’t care about bots; can I just leave out the <body> GTM snippet from my website? \n\n- Would this cause any problems that I’m not aware of?\n- Is there anything else that I need to consider?\n- Are there any alternative to this?",

UA offered some features to handle this, but these are not yet available in GA4. The solution I found was to modify the referrer in GTM, before the hit is sent to GA4. It appears to be working fine.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n**In Google Tag Manager**\n\n1. Create a new User-Defined Variable, and select JavaScript Variable as type\n2. Paste in the code below into the field and save it\n3. On your GA4 tags, add the following under 'Fields to Set': page\\_referrer\n4. Set the value of page\\_referrer to the JavaScript variable you created before\n\nThe code I created:\n\n    function(){\n      var referrer_hostname = new URL(document.referrer).hostname;\n      var facebook_arr      = [\n        'm.facebook.com',\n        'mobile.facebook.com',\n        'l.facebook.com',\n        'lm.facebook.com',\n        'web.facebook.com',\n        'touch.facebook.com'\n      ];\n      \n      if(facebook_arr.includes(referrer_hostname)){\n        return 'https://www.facebook.com/';\n      } else {\n        return document.referrer;\n      }\n    }\n\nIt works great.

It says:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Don’t add more than one Google tag to each page. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to remove the old gtag.js now because my team still relies on it to count output, and we have our ad account linked to the older GA.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis one's been a pain for a few days, and I'm hoping to get a little help! We are running a WordPress site, have set up a GA4 account, got our \"Measurement ID\" of the form G-XABCDEFGHI, embedded the recommended script in the WordPress header php:\n\n`<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) --> <script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XABCDEFGHI\"></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'G-XABCDEFGHI'); </script>`\n\nWe can observe this script is in the page DOM on every page of the site (browser developer tools).\n\nOur marketing company is forming URLs as follows (actual website redacted, and specific UTM values also redacted and replaced with \"test\" or \"testing\").\n\n`https://our-domain.co.uk/?utm_source=testing&utm_medium=testing&utm_campaign=test&utm_content=2023-09-09`\n\nWe can observe an HTTP POST to `https://region1.google-analytics.com/g/collect`: (again most codes/numbers etc. are redacted as I'm unsure which could identify my GA account!!\n\n`https://region1.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-XABCDEFGHI&gtm=13tr5367&_p=163425986&cid=1111111111.1694258684&ul=en-gb&sr=3440x1440&uaa=x86&uab=64&uafvl=Chromium%3B116.0.5845.180%7CNot)A%253BBrand%3B24.0.0.0%7CGoogle%2520Chrome%3B116.0.5845.180&uamb=0&uam=&uap=Windows&uapv=10.0.0&uaw=0&_s=1&sid=1111111111&sct=1&seg=1&dl=https%3A%2F%2Four-domain.co.uk%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtesting%26utm_medium%3Dtesting%26utm_campaign%3Dtest%26utm_content%3D2023-09-09&dt=our_web_title_appears_here&en=page_view&_ee=1`\n\nWe are simply not seeing this traffic being recorded in GA4. Neither in \"real-time\" nor in reports. There have been some intermittent captures, when we've tested from our own office. The web logs indicate many visitors (hundreds) but GA rarely captures more than a dozen landings in a day.\n\nIn our own HTTP/SSL web logs, we can see plenty of people landing on our site with UTM codes in their landing URLS.\n\nWe (currently) do not have a CSP, I read that having one (specifically an out-of-date one) could cause issues with google \"regions\" in respect of GDPR. But I don't think the issue is here as we're currently running without a CSP.\n\nSometimes the marketing company uses a utm\\_campaign wth an encoded space (appears as a '+' plus in the URL) - when this happens our site issues 301 redirect, which turns the '+' into an HTTP encoded '%20', the user/browser follows the redirect and we can see them land again, UTM parameters still intact, receive a 200 and some page content etc.\n\nWe turned off all GA4 filters, in case the 301 counted as \"internal traffic\", but I don't think that's it either, since several of the campaigns haven't featured the '+', so have gone straight to HTTP:200.\n\nWe've checked and triple-checked the Measurement ID in GA, in GTM and in the embedded script. GTM is definitely configured to \"pass\" our measurement ID to our GA4 \"property\".\n\nI'd gratefully appreciate any more thoughts on what we might investigate, and apologise for a lengthy post!\n\nMany thanks,\n\nclumsy.....",

At least that's what I've been told by a marketing agency.\n\nSo my question is twofold:\n\n1. Is this actually a common thing? Has anyone else experienced the same problem? (Google Signals not working with server-side GA4)\n2. How should I actually implement the double tracking? I mean I can simply duplicate the GA4 configuration tag and all GA4 event tags, and have one set of tags send to my tagging server and the other set of tags send directly to GA4, but this just feels so bad and cumbersome...

You could use a single property and even use the same stream measurement ID to receive data ... presumably with a custom dimension indicating where the data came from.\n\nI think I'd still just keep it entirely separated.\n\n~~The \"trick\" here may be to go ahead and have two GA4 config tags, but let's assume you already have your server-side config tag, you would then use tag sequencing on that tag to fire the web GA4 config tag either before or after the server-side GA4 config tag.~~\n\n~~What I'd be careful to test is that you get consistent results and that any fields and/or user properties are being sent correctly.~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\* I'm going to test this, because now I'm curious.\n\nSecond Edit: I'm talking out out my backside.

I've got Simo Avahara's 'EEC Products -> GA4 Items' variable template set up and I'm populating it in the 'Send Ecommerce Events' area of the GA4 event tag. \n\nIn GTM preview mode I see the variable working perfectly, but I must be missing some important step because none of the ecomm data are populating in GA itself.\n\nAnyone use this setup yet able to point me in the right direction? Thanks so much for the help!",

        "author": "TC-marketing",
        "id": "y28x69",
        "selftext": "I'm working on transitioning my global company's site to GA4 and I'm not sure what the best approach is for the setup. I'm considering 2 approaches described below. If anyone else has had to set up GA4 for multiple countries (or maybe multiple lines of business, departments, something else similar) that all share a domain, I'd love to hear what setup you went with and how it's working out.\n\nThe company operates in several countries, and every country is on our domain with separate subdirectories by locale, e.g. /en-US/. Historically, the different countries were on separate domains (.com, .ca, .co.uk etc.), so today we have a separate UA property and GTM container for every country.\n\nFor GA4, I want to have every country's data flowing into one GA4 property. That seems like the cleanest option given the data stream setup GA4 uses and the ability to create unique reports in explore, so the different countries can see their own data.\n\nBut for GTM, I'm split between:\n\n1. **Merge every country into one GTM container.**\n   1. Downsides:\n      1. Each country's individual tags would need to have the firing triggers filtered to only apply to their locale, e.g. pages with URL containing /en-US/ vs. all pages. (This means modifying all existing tags and risk of data corruption if the teams don't consistently set the triggers correctly.)\n      2. The one GTM container will have a ton of tags in it worked on by different teams. It could make it harder for people to find their own tags (e.g. if the UK and US team each have 5 specific Meta pixel tags) and with more people working in there, it could cause mixups with version publishing.\n   2. Benefits:\n      1. There's a single GA4 implementation in GTM that applies to every single country's data. The main implementation tag as well as ecommerce event tags, variables, etc., and custom events that multiple countries would like to measure, are only created once.\n2. **Maintain separate GTM containers by country.** Create a GA4 implementation tag in each country's container that sends data to the same global GA4 property/measurement ID.\n   1. Downsides:\n      1. All of the GA4 events (and component parts like variables and triggers) need to be created in duplicate for every country's container.\n      2. There will be several GTM containers implemented on various sections of the site (though no individual page should have more than one GTM container) and several GA4 implementations sending data into the same property. **Is this possible? Is it advisable? Might it cause load time issues or data discrepancies in GA4?**\n   2. Benefits:\n      1. The different teams in each country can work and publish in their own containers without interfering with anyone else's tags. Each country can easily find the tags that belong to them.\n      2. The tags in each individual country container can continue to use \"all pages\" triggers, since that container ID will be implemented only on the pages within a given locale (like /en-US/) rather than across all pages on our domain.\n\nThanks in advance for any input!",

Our site is very large across 20 subdomains that have very different tracking needs, so one container holds events that are specific to the subdomain and the other container is a container that fires page view tag and any other global events like video tracking and pixels.

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nWorking on an upcoming feature that will use a lightbox for conversions that require a form submission. Essentially, the conversion requires a user account, but the CTA is available whether the user is signed in or out. If signed in, there's no form - the user just clicks the CTA and it converts. If signed out, today, the user is taken to a second page to either sign in or sign up, and after successfully completing that, they are returned to the original page with the conversion completed. What we're developing is a lightbox to contain the sign up/sign in form to see if it improves conversion for signed-out users to keep them on the same page. I'd like to set up event tracking to measure interactions and conversions that include the lightbox user journey.\n\nWith the current user flow, there is a standalone URL that records the user's visit to the form since it's on a separate page. Is there a best practice when developing a lightbox that will make it easier to track (ie create an event tag and trigger) when a user lands on/interacts with the lightbox? \n\nWould appreciate any insights or being pointed towards resources that may help. TIA!",

If you consider the traffic across all three subdomains to be one big group (i.e. maybe you need combined traffic for advertising audience purposes), you could make one GTM container, put it on all three subdomains, and collect everything into one GA4 account. If you need to track sessions and users that hop between the three sites, turn on cross-domain tracking to pass the cookies and UserIDs between them. If you do it this way, you can toggle between website analytics in GA4 by building comparisons, segments, and/or filters using the hostname dimension.\n\nIf you want to see traffic completely independently in three separate GA4 properties, you should probably create three different GTM containers. Cross domain measurement wouldn't apply in this case. That only applies to different sites that have the same data stream. I can understand the desire to only have one GTM container, i.e. less tags to manage if all three sites process the same types of events. But it's best to maintain them separately. You MIGHT be able to do what you're describing with one GTM container and 3 separate GA4 properties if you do some funky stuff with the GA4 measurement ID being set by a variable. In that case, you'd have to shove the actual measurement ID into the datalayer on each site, probably before you load the GTM container, grab the dataLayer variable with a custom GTM variable, and spit that into your GA4 tags. This should work, in theory, to create a dynamic kind of GTM tag, but I wouldn't do it. That type of infrastructure feels too fragile to me. I know it's a pain to maintain separate GTM containers, but it gives you more control. You can use the import/export tool to speed up the process of deploying changes across your containers. Just make sure to double check your tags after importing to make sure they're routed to the right GA4 property.\n\nHope this helps a little. Good luck!",

Your other criteria seem pretty specific so I wouldn’t worry about it misfiring.\n\nEDIT: just throwing this out there, but remember that when you send back a dynamic variable ( such as {{Click ID}} ) that it will be sending back any variation of that variable that GTM picks up based on what gets past the trigger. You may flood your GA Event Label dimension with a bunch of random Click IDs. If your trigger only allows the tag to send back relatively clean data you may be okay, but just something to keep in mind in order to optimize what data you have in your GA account.",

The site is built with Elementor and I'm using Google Sitekit.\n\nWhen I went to GA4 a few days ago I could see activity in debug view and real time, however now I can't and I have no idea why. I have the GA4 config tag firing on all pages and it has the field {{Debug Mode}} set to \"true\".\n\nIs sitekit a bit shit? I noticed a lot of people got JSON errors earlier this week but it was resolved. While that was happening I uninstalled it and figured out how to add the GTM code straight into the site (Elementor has a nice custom code feature specifically for snippets) but I kinda like having the sitekit dashboard (even though I have no traffic yet) so I reverted to it once they resolved the issue (I did remove the snippets I added manually prior).\n\nI did the \"view page source\" thing and see snippets for analytics and GTM, but that's about as far as my expertise goes. I've also got the internal and developer traffic filters active.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nThanks!",

You can save this and create another one for your staging site. Same steps, but filter hostname for your staging site.\n\nNow you can flip between segments of all traffic, staging and production.\n\nHope this helps!",

IWe have walked through all the steps over and over again, like many other clients before. It's regarding a WooCommerce shop using GTM4WP. \n\nWhat I am seeing now, is that all events are firing perfectly fine. However, the only ones showing up in analytics are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* gtm4wp.changeDetailViewEEC\n* klik\n* gtm4wp.addProductToCartEEC\n* gtm4wp.checkoutStepEEC\n* gtm4wp.checkoutOptionEEC\n* gtm4wp.removeFromCartEEC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, the transaction/purchase events are not coming through in UA. That means that the enhanced e-commerce tracking is not working properly. We are seeing conversions, but only on goal level. So no conversions in actual monetary values are showing. \n\nI cannot seem to find why the transactional events are all firing in console and GTM debugger, but not coming through in UA. \n\nDoes anyone know where this might be going wrong?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot in advance.",

You can leave the GTM code on the site, and have the existing GA continue to work with out any issues, as long as you do not add the same GA code to the GTM container while the GA code is also deployed on the site. As u/sharathonthemove pointed out, this will cause duplicate hits to be sent.  \n\n\nIf you want, you can add the GA code to the GTM container, but then you'd have to remove it from the site and only deploy it via the GTM container. You may want to deploy the GA code to the GTM container as this will give you more flexibility over modifying the tracking as many modifications, which would otherwise require developer involvement, can be managed via GTM.  \n\n\nYou could, however, leave the GA code on the site and only use the GTM container for adding other tags, such as Facebook or adwords tags. Remember that the GTM container is just a box, it does nothing unless you add things to it.  \n\n\n2. This sounds more tricky and I'd be wary of fiddling around with the production version of the container if you're not so experienced (no offense intended). Firstly, get familiar with the preview pane of GTM and how container versions can be tested. You say you added a new tag to GTM to try and tag the home page, but it sounds to me that you should take a look at the existing tags and figure out why it's not firing on that particular page. If you have multiple GA tags on the site then it sound like there could be risk of duplicate hits being sent. I recommend, as a first step, checking to make sure that all the GA instances that are deployed are different properties i.e. different UA ids. Otherwise you will be sending duplicate hits and breaking your data.",

Now we have had a couple however the forms are usually on a single page containing only the form on which users arrive after clicking a button on another page. So for example in a blog there is an href with the text: 'Interested in the possibilities for you organisation? Request information here!'. Sorry if it's getting confusing but it basically comes to down to this: how can I see from which page a user that submitted a form came? Is this something that can be added as a secondary dimension in the events tab?",

I've inspected the page and GTM preview debugger to know that the category is \"Button Clicks\" and action is \"Click\" which I've inserted into GTM alongside my GA tracking code UA-...- and I've also ticked \"Enable override settings\". I inserted this into the goal settings in GA as well.\n\nThe event is reaching GA because I can see it in behavior-events but I don't understand why it won't track it properly as a goal.

All of them. And determine if they're still useful. And that goes for determining if they're affecting site performance, too. My experience is that GTM affects performance less than people worry about, but if you're automatically firing a bunch of custom html tags with js scripts, for example, it certainly can.\n\nIf you don't have the time for a proper audit, check your site core vitals and/or partner with a dev to assess the site's page/content load times.

A Google Tag can hold multiple tag IDs, any of which are able to trigger it via GTM or on-site code.\n\nFor some reason Google makes [merging tags](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/12329709?hl=en-GB) sound like a great idea, when it usually just leads to measurement chaos and is a super bad idea unless you absolutely understand the implications of what you're doing.\n\nYou can't delete tag IDs, you can only add them to new tags. You can do that by clicking the splitting arrow icon on the tag ID. You can also merge them into other tags, but I don't think you can do that on an individual basis.\n\nWhat makes things extra confusing is that once you start moving any of this stuff around, your Tag ID, GA4 Measurement ID, and Destination ID can all refer to different websites and platforms *despite being identical in terms of their letters and numbers*.\n\nIf you're seeing those tag IDs there, it means that they're no longer associated with any other destinations or Google Tags (i.e. website 2). Destinations must have a linked Google Tag, so the other website's property should have been assigned to a new Google Tag, which would have generated new tag IDs.\n\nYour best bet might just be to leave that mess of IDs alone, figure out which Google Tag is currently sending data to your other website and what its IDs are, and make sure that all your tagging for website 1 refers to only one of the tag IDs from your screenshot, and all your tagging for website 2 refers to only one of the tag IDs from that other Google Tag.\n\nIf that Google Ads account is shared across both websites then, well, good luck. You may need to split it back out into a third Google Tag, otherwise you may inadvertently send the same website data to both destinations while trying to build remarketing audiences.",

Whenever you load that combined tag, it sends data to both destinations. \n\nIf you're using a remarketing tag in Google Tag Manager rather than adding the Google Tag to your site, it might be okay, but if you're tracking via anything that refers to any of those tag IDs, it'll send data to that GA4 property in your screenshot as well as GAds. \n\nWhat you can do is split off that AW- tag ID into a new Google Tag by clicking the split arrow icon, then click the minus icon next to the GAds destination which should let you move it into the Google Tag you've just created while preserving its original Tag ID.\n\nIf you want, you can also split off the Tag ID that corresponds with the other website's Measurement ID (found in its GA4 admin settings > data collection > data streams > its data steam), find that other destination (from that same menu you can click into its tag settings to see where it is), then move that destination into the new tag with its Measurement ID. \n\nThat's optional as you can still track that property via whatever GT- tag ID is associated with its GA4 destination currently, but I find it super confusing when the Measurement ID is a Tag ID for a different property.",

My boss created a regular Tag in Tag Manager a few months ago, so is it sending data to ***his*** GA4 account (that I'm only assuming exists)? I created a new GA4 account with the website property, but I've found no way to 'connect' the existing Tag to the new account I created. \n\nAm I misunderstanding how the Tag functions? Is there no way I can just link the Tag currently installed and gathering data to a new GA4 account? My brain is just struggling to comprehend the whole 'container' 'account' 'property' 'tag' 'trigger' thing. I need to put together a basic report, and I'm running out of time and patience. The Google articles and videos confused me, and trying to figure it out myself has made me go around in circles.\n\nI'm not sure if I articulated myself properly, I'll be happy to elaborate in the comments.",

As nervous as everyone gets, these algorithms are not designed to track user behavior to such a degree that they can accurately track everything they do. They're calibrated based on your account and what you care about and so will vary depending on how much effort you put into tailoring it. \n\nBeyond that, these are very old systems that have been updated over time. As the internet evolves with age, the backend on these products get more and more complicated with how they operate. For example, it is no longer legal to track user behavior over various urls, so the exact accuracy of a users data you can collect is less than what it used to be. You gotta put some level of guessing or prediction into the equation, again meaning that the different products might predict something slightly different. 16% is minimal",

If you're adding a GA4 tag, use the Measurement ID.\n\n\n\n\nIf \"Enhanced Measurement\" is enabled for the Google Tag you are using, page_view events should be tracked automatically when the Google Tag triggers. If it's disabled you will have to send a manual page_view event with the GA4 Tag (after triggering the Google Tag).\n\n\n\n\n>There was also TWO tag ids in my analytics account so I just grabbed the first one\n\n\nDon't just pick one at random. Make sure the Google Tag you've selected actually has the desired Measurement ID mapped as a Destination.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, just in case you've missed this part, make sure you actually published the changes in your GTM workspace.",

More so because the documentation is all over the place and Google Analytics itself is menu diving hell in its own right.\n\nThat being noted, I have an existing website that we configured with Google Tag Manager so that any tags created with Google Tag Manager would be used automatically, and would help store page view events, click events etc.\n\nMy main thing is this:\n- How do I hook the existing Google Tag Manager tags so that when they are triggered, they send data to an existing 'Data Stream' that exists on Google Analytics?\n\nI ask this because it looks like you have to not only create a duplicate tag on the Google Tag Manager side to specifically use Google Analytics, but when I do so, it wants the measurement ID and complains that it's not present in the container even when I put this value into the related field.\n\nDo I have to add yet another Google Tag that specifies the Google Analytics measurement id value somehow?\n\nOn top of that, if I find the Data Stream section and look to add a custom event, the event section itself on Google Analytics wants its own triggers, which defeats the purpose of defining the triggers on the Google Tag Manager side.\n\nReally, ideally, I just want it so that when a Google Tag Manager based tag fires, it just sends the data to Google Analytics.\n\nOtherwise, I have found this process to be pretty damn difficult, frustrating, and stupidly hard for someone who knows a ton about tech and computers.",

Correct me if I am wrong but I understand your problem is that you have defined custom events on Google Tag Manager and want to see them on Google Analytics 4 property. Ideally you do not need to create custom events within GA4. You can define an event with a proper trigger and If your measurement ID is correct you should see the event on GA4. I would suggest you to do a simultaneous debugging. Once you open the preview mode on GTM also open the GA4's debug view (Admin->Data Display->Debug View). Trigger your new tag and you should see the event in GA4's debug view. Once you successfully do it, it means your GTM is working and sending data to your GA4 account. However, this does not mean that you will see your new event immediately on your events report. After publishing your GTM container wait up to 48 hours. In this point you should see your event at the reports.  \n\n\nAn additional note is that you should have at least one Google tag (previously known as Google Analytics Configuration Tag) that is firing at all pages (or all the pages you want to track). If you do not have such a tag GTM will give you an error stating that Google Tag is not found on the container. It is a tag pretty easy to set up; just enter your measurement ID and set the trigger to all pages' pageview.   \n\n\nLet me know if it helps.",

Currently, I'm setting up Google Analytics for a website and encountered the following issue:\n\nWhen I open Tag Assistant in preview mode:\n1) I open the dropdown menu to select product categories, click on an item in the dropdown. In the debug, I see \"Click\" on the input to open the categories, but there's no click when selecting a specific category.\n2) After filling out an ad and successfully publishing it, a popup window appears. Initially, it displays information that the ad is being processed. When it's successfully published, another element appears in the same popup indicating that the ad has been successfully published. Here's the problem: the appearance of the container itself is visible in debug as a \"Visible element.\" However, when the element indicating successful ad placement appears, nothing appears in debug.\n\nI managed to find out that debug takes information from the dataLayer. I asked our frontend developer to add clicks on the category and the appearance of the successful banner to the dataLayer. However, he replied that they don't send anything to the dataLayer at all (quote: \"We don't send anything for GTM\").\n\nI don't understand if any data can be \"automatically\" sent to the dataLayer if the frontend doesn't send anything. Who misunderstands something - me or the frontend developer?\n\nPerhaps there's a way to solve my problem on my side?\n\nThanks for the help!\n",

You wouldn't use page\\_view for this, but likely a custom \"taxonomy\" event with a parameter or two that you then unearth via custom dimensions within GA4.\n\nGA4 reporting is flexible enough though that if you did decide to instead send the taxonomy tags as a comma or vertical bar separated list, you could manipulate existing reports or create an exploration report that would be able to filter using that string to include / exclude one or more tag. This would cut down on the number of events and network hits involved.",

The trigger group will then fire your tag once.\n\nI'm happy to take a more direct look into this for you if you want to share details in a DM.",

I've never done it before but had been taking Google's online courses and, although the learning curve seemed steep, I assumed I could figure it all out.  (I was also unaware of the UA to GA4 transition but that's a tale for another time).\n\nAnyways, things were going well until I stumbled across a tutorial that stated \"Next, you'll want to link your Google Tag manager account\" ... and I've been scouring the internet for the last 2 hours trying to figure it all out.\n\nHere's my question:  **How necessary (if at all) IS Google Tag Manager?**  I thought Google Analytics stored all the necessary metrics and dimensions I would need to keep track of.  My client is just starting her photography business in a fairly small town and we simply wanted to set up Analytics to be able to track how her updated SEO-copy is doing.\n\nAny guidance is GREATLY appreciated!!

So far, no revenue has been recorded.\n\nIn debugging mode through Tag Manager, I tested the checkout process and copied and pasted the code for UA below from the purchase page. (The question is below the code)\n\nga('require', 'ecommerce');\n\nga('ecommerce:addTransaction', {\n\n'id': 'xxxxx', // Transaction ID. Required.\n\n'affiliation': 'xxxx\\[.xxxxx.com\\]', // Affiliation or store name.\n\n'revenue': 'x.xx', // Grand Total.\n\n'shipping': 'xx.xx', // Shipping.\n\n'tax': 'x.xx' // Tax.\n\n});\n\nga('ecommerce:addItem', {\n\n'id': 'xxxxx', // Transaction ID. Required.\n\n'name': 'XXXXX', // Product name. Required.\n\n'sku': 'xxxxx', // SKU/code.\n\n'category': '', // Category or variation, should be category purchased from, not necessarily primary category.\n\n'price': 'x.xxxxxxx', // Unit price.\n\n'quantity': 'x' // Quantity.\n\n});\n\nSo based on the code above, I created a Tag in Tag Manager for the event ‘*purchase*’ that fires for every instance of a pageview when a specific token expression shows up in a URL and the parameters ‘items,’ ‘transaction\\_id,’ and ‘value’ are present. The question I am really stuck on, is how would I write the Data Layer Variable based on the code above? I have 'value' written as “ecommerce.addTransaction.revenue”. In the code, it was shown as e-commerce:addTransaction’, {‘id’: so I am not sure if that is how it should be written.\n\nAny help or direction to get this working would be greatly appreciated!

Data layer values could be eventCategory, eventAction and eventLabel\n- one GA \"event\" tag that pulls the variables from the ones you setup for category, action and label, and that fires on your custom event trigger.\n\nWhen setup correctly, you just need to push your event to the  datalayer with something like this\n\ndataLayer.push({\n    event: 'trackEvent',\n    eventCategory: 'your category',\n    eventAction: 'your action',\n    eventLabel: 'your label'\n});\n\nAnd you won't need to configure gtm for every specific event.

But I'm wondering, if GTM automatically loads GA.\n\nThat's because [this guide](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-set-up-google-analytics/) says, I only have to add GTM and create the GA property/tag in GTM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analytics**\n\n[https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs?hl=de](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs?hl=de) says, I need to add the following snippet to my site:\n\n    <!-- Google Analytics -->\n    <script>\n    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n    (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n    m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n    })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n    \n    ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');\n    ga('send', 'pageview');\n    </script>\n    <!-- End Google Analytics -->\n\nThat adds GA to my site, but is it needed if I already added the code above and did the steps from the hootsuite guide?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analytics > measurement > gtag.js**\n\nTo make my confusion complete, there is gtag.js and the [corresponding guide](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs). To be hones: I don't know what gtag.js is and what it does. It seems to me, that I can create/add tags to google analytics, but how is different to the tag manager then?\n\nThe guide says to add:\n\n    <!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->\n    <script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID\"></script>\n    <script>\n      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n      gtag('js', new Date());\n    \n      gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');\n    </script>\n\nSame question: Do I need it if I already added the GTM snippet from above?",

Technically the email signup tool is a form, but my attempts to add the form title to Category, Action, or Label have thus far proven unsuccessful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny suggestions?

Sometimes, plugins or themes can interfere. In GTM's Preview mode, look in the event stream for 'wpformsFormSubmit' when you submit the form. If it doesn't show up, the trigger won't activate.  \n  \nIf it isn't firing, you might need to add a small JS snippet to trigger a custom event or check WPForms docs for GA/GTM integration steps.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nHoping to get some help from the analytics community here. I'm an email marketer, not a professional analyst, and I'm trying to get better at measuring the success of my campaigns in GA4. I've hit a wall with some revenue data that just doesn't make sense to me.\n\n**The Problem I'm Seeing**\n\nWhen I build reports in GA4 Explore, I see a massive difference between two metrics. For my newsletter campaigns in one month, GA4 reported:\n\n* `Total Revenue`: $410k USD\n* `Item Revenue`: $190k USD\n\nI know shipping/taxes can cause a small difference, but this is huge and makes it impossible for me to know the real financial impact of my emails.\n\n**What I've Found So Far**\n\nI did some digging and noticed the problem is almost entirely in campaigns related to our loyalty program, where we remind customers about their points.\n\nI managed to isolate a single transaction from one of these campaigns, and this is where it gets really weird:\n\n* In one report, this transaction's `Total Revenue` is \\~**31 000**\n* In another report, the `Item Revenue` for the exact same transaction is only **442**\n\n**My Best Guess (and this is where I need you!)**\n\nAgain, I'm not an analyst, but my hypothesis is this:\n\nWhen a customer uses their loyalty points to get a \"reward\" product, our system still fires a `purchase` event. Could it be that the `value` parameter (which becomes `Total Revenue`) is being set to the full market price of the reward, while the `items` array (which calculates `Item Revenue`) is correctly showing only the small amount of *real money* the customer paid?\n\n**My Questions for You All:**\n\n1. Does this sound like a plausible explanation? Has anyone ever seen an e-commerce setup that tracks loyalty points this way?\n2. As a marketer, what can I do right now to get a cleaner view of the *real monetary revenue* from my campaigns? Is there a report I can build to reliably see the revenue I'm actually generating?\n3. What is the \"correct\" way this should be tracked?\n\nAny advice or insight would be massively appreciated!\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm an email marketer seeing a huge discrepancy between `Total Revenue` and `Item Revenue`. I *think* it's because our loyalty point redemptions are tracked with the full market value in `Total Revenue`, but only the real money paid in `Item Revenue`. Has anyone seen this, and what's the best way for me to report on the actual, real-money results of my campaigns?",

So, whoever developed your event did exactly what Google instructs to.\n\nWhile most would fix it, it might be worth thinking through it - you'll no longer have both pre and post discounted revenue (total v. item), you'll only have discounted. As long as pre-discounted revenue isn't ever a considered metric, great, but as is you have both. In favor of the fix, if you're sending purchase data via pixel, they probably want the actual transaction value. \n\nAlso, while it's a little manual, but you report full item value now without committing discounted total revenue reporting:\n\n1. Create two item-scoped reports in two tabs of an exploration with dimensions item name/id/whatever, item quantity, item price, and metric item revenue.\n2. filter one for item revenue = 0 and another for item revenue > 0. Export the revenue = 0 tab and calculate the total \"would have been\" item revenue: item quantity \\* item price\n3. Sum them if you want: The exported manual calculated report and the revenue > 0 reports should sum more closely to your total revenue number.\n\nKeep in mind that you can also develop things like 'discount', 'coupon', 'campaign', etc. into the item or purchase e-commerce array... and then into explorations as custom dimensions provided they've been added in the Admin custom definitions section.\n\nTL:DR: If it's as simple as wanting total rev to reflect discounts, your devs just need to include coupon/campaign/discount/? value as a parameter in the purchase event and update the value parameter to reflect the 'net value' of the transaction.",

Items should reflect real paid amounts Can you ask your Devs to adapt this (can points be calculated as a value and then deducted?)\n\nMight be useful to also add some custom prams like original price, loyalty points redeemed.\n\nWould be good to see your full ecommerce purchase event datalayer structure if you are doing it like that. Or the output in debug mode.",

It works in tandem with **Google Analytics.** Though, you don't need to replace or change your current GA4 setup, since it doesn't impact it.\n\nIntegration takes 15 minutes.\n\n**What you'll get to test:**\n\n* **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English and receive instant visualizations, eliminating the need for complex SQL queries.\n* **Session Replay**: Watch real user sessions to identify bugs, UX friction, and confusing flows, helping you understand the user journey in detail.\n* **Feature/Page Usage Analytics**: Discover which features/pages are most engaged with and identify those that are underutilized, allowing for data-driven product decisions.\n* **Funnel Analysis**: Pinpoint exactly where users drop off in their journey and understand the reasons behind it, enabling targeted improvements.\n* **Automatic Event Tracking**: Implement tracking without Google Tag Manager, as we automatically capture and tag every user action.\n\nWe’re not selling anything — just looking for honest feedback.  \nYou’ll get full onboarding help and access to all features. Zero commitment.\n\nIf you want to better understand your users, **comment below**!\n\nDo you think nobody needs it? You have any questions, doubts? Let's discuss here.

Phew.\n\nLooking at your screenshot of mediums, I probably wouldn't start investigating ad traffic or any specific channel to start, as all of your mediums (including Organic) seem to have dropped simultaneously.\n\nDoes your channel report provide any clues though?...Did you all of the sudden see a proportional spike in \"unassigned\" or other channel (SMS, etc.) at that time? I don't think 'unassigned' has a source/medium, and so wouldn't be included in the sessions report in your screenshot. That'd probably be too easy, but quick to confirm.\n\nDid your consent settings change at all? For example if your consent was set to auto accept and then configured to auto deny, your traffic might drop off.\n\nWas there a code release on the site around then? If so, is it possible that the GTM code snippet was deleted or moved somewhere else on some high traffic page(s) and that's preventing the dataLayer from loading, or causing it to be overwritten? If deleted, no tracking and a huge drop off. Also, I'm assuming you did, but just in case: did you check GTM versions to make absolutely sure that nothing new was published?\n\nThose are usual suspects for a channel-agnostic and precipitous drop in traffic, all events, etc. like that. Drops like these are almost always technical implementation issues - it's as though GA4 has disappeared from the site's code base. Either that, or there's something opting the vast majority of users out of tracking. The silver lining is that the drop is huge and that it's not channel-specific it doesn't seem - the problem will probably stick out like a sore thumb when you get a little further under the hood. \n\nI'd open the site, open Console in Dev Tools, and start testing. In Console, you can see what events are firing by entering 'dataLayer' into the prompt. If you're familiar with GTM debugging, that's even better.",

While it's more or less straightforward to me how to implement GTM with GA4 and other tags, configure conversions, create UTM tagging rules and set it up with Google ads, the project seems complex (18 businesses) and I'm wondering if anyone more experienced here could give me some pointers and tips that I can improve my presentation. \n\nAny little hacks or \"how would I do it\" are helpful - willing to share a reward in case I win the process and get the client.\n\n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n**Role: Digital Marketing & Analytics freelance consultant (8-16h/week)**  \n  \nObjetive: help unify digital marketing operations across its 18 businesses. While each company currently operates with some level of autonomy, they all use ServiceTitan as their CRM and rely on Google Analytics and Google Ads for marketing insights—though tracking and reporting structures vary widely.\n\nNote:   \n\\- The most critical aspect of this role is deep expertise in Google Ads, Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics 4, and ServiceTitan, as well as experience standardizing marketing tracking and reporting across multiple businesses - whether in a holding company or in a similarly structured environment. This individual must quickly assess the client's current digital marketing landscape and implement a unified framework to ensure all businesses are tracking, defining conversions, and integrating data consistently.  \n\\- A highly hands-on approach is essential, as this role goes beyond just project management but also direct execution—setting up integrations, resolving technical challenges, and providing clear guidance to internal teams. The ideal candidate will have deep expertise in paid search advertising, with a strong emphasis on tracking accuracy, attribution modeling, and performance optimization to drive measurable results.",

        "selftext": "Hi all, apologies in advance for the super long post but I'm at my wits' end and have no idea how to resolve this. Please be kind — I actually don't know much about GA or GTM beyond what I have read on Google instructional articles as I am primarily a graphic designer who was kind of forced to moonlight as a marketing/analytics person by my boss (but that's another story).\n\nAnyway: the main issue is that this quarter, 60k out of 62k visits to our website's homepage has a session source/medium of (not set). We've had some (not set) data in the past before but never this much, and there was a little yellow warning sign next to the data that said this data was coming up as (not set) because no data was received. However, the most immediate solution that Google has for this is to make sure the website's Google Tag has a trigger of \"initialisation - all pages\" in Google Tag Manager — which I had done in Google Tag Manager ages ago and nothing about it has changed.\n\nHowever, Google Tag Manager is also now telling me that there's an urgent issue because my Google Tag has stopped sending data. Clicking on the Help article for this leads to instructions on how to set up the website's Google Tag in GTM and GA4, both of which I also did ages ago, and upon re-checking there really doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the way the tags are set up on both platforms. My containers are all published in GTM. Under Admin > Data Streams > View tag instructions in GA4, there is a green tick telling me that data is flowing, and when I type the website URL into the bottom box to scan, another green tick comes up indicating the tag is installed and working.\n\nSo basically I have no clue what on earth is going on — I don't understand why GTM is telling me that my Google Tag hasn't been sending data for at least 48 hours, and I don't know why or if this has caused the 60k (not set) data coming up on Google Analytics. I know this may be two entirely separate issues, but any help would be appreciate on either or both!!",

We are trying to see how the arregement/wording of different landings affect the decision of testing our product or not. In that event have the landing\\_version property, which is the number version of the one the user sees.\n\nI want to do different analysis, like how much they scrolled, where they click etc per different landing\\_version. Since it seemed impossible in GA I was lowering my expectations to just be able to see depending on each landing\\_version how many users ended up login in (if we could filter by first time user even better) But even with that i can not seem to see how to do that. I have background in platforms like Mixpanel and Amplitude which doing analysis like that was extremely easy.\n\nI also have tried to connect with Bigquery and I have tried to connect directly to postgresql using airbyte, so i can use the raw data and do the analysis with SQL but the data does not contain the events which is mindblowing.

Create a filter for version A and version B using your event parameter. Analyze your scroll rate, conversion rates, etc.. at session-level.\n\n- Use BigQuery in the same way by filtering session_id which contains the event param version A or B...\n\nNow to make it easier for you next time I would advise setting your event parameter landing_version on the Google Tag directly instead of on a unique landing_array event. It will ensure that your parameter is populated on every single event which uses your Google Tag. Easier to manipulate later.\n\nYou could also use the User Properties feature in the same way to make sure this value is available on all interactions done by the user.",

For example, websiteexample1.com and websiteexample2.com automatically changes to the URL of mainwebsite.com. \n\nThere are five individual domains. Right now, I have made five individual properties that represent those five individual domains in Google Analytics. All these properties are under the main website. The main goal is to differentiate the traffic coming from each domain, and still also be able to track the “main domain.”\n\nThe websites were all registered through godaddy, and then transferred all to AWS. All management of those domains are under AWS now, something I do not have access to. However, I do have access to all of the Google Analytics/Google Tags Account.\n\nCan someone help me achieve what was mentioned before? I have considered adding some kind of tracking code through the URL that each domain forwards to(like mainwebsite.com/trackingcodeforexample2/ . However, how would I set that up, and even connect that through AWS? \n\nAnother thing commonly suggested is putting the tracking code on the actual code of the website, which is another thing I don’t have.\n\nPSA: Before anyone goes \"ask for more access to troubleshoot\", my boss doesn't know how to give me access, I just want to get this thing done, and I'm just an intern/contractor.\n\n",

(The campaign is called Lady Kings of Texas if you want to look for it. I don't think I can link it here without getting removed by auto moderation.)\n\nS&S has a place in the campaign dashboard to insert a GA measurement ID, and that's been done, but no data is being registered. It is showing up in the HTML though, and Seed&Spark has said it's been done correctly, so it appears it's done as it should. However, S&S customer service says the issue is on Google Analytic's side, not theirs.\n\nI think that might be wrong though and from what I can tell, it's because the implementation on the backend is still using UA and not GA4. But I'm not well-versed enough to know for sure. I've tried debugging with Google Tag Manager and it's showing that a legacy tag is detected and so can't be dubugged.\n\nThe script call in the HTML looks like this:\n\n        <script>\n           window.ga = window.ga || function () {\n                (ga.q = ga.q || []).push(arguments)\n            };\n            ga.l = +new Date;\n            ga('create', 'G-6PR7T653X8', 'auto', 'filmmaker');\n            ga('filmmaker.send', 'pageview');\n        </script>\n\nAs I understand, that's legacy UA code, not the current GA4 code. If so, is that enough to prevent data from going to the GA Property? Or is there something else that needs to be done on the GA side to make it work? Thanks for any insight.",

There are several ways to run campaigns but the most common are cpc (cost per click) and cpa (cost per acquisition/conversion). If you are interested in reach, or getting users to your web app, you may want to use cpc, where you pay for users clicking on your ad. With cpa you pay only when a user converted (aka. a business goal like a purchase/subscription).\n\nI fail to see how clicking on an ad can be your business end goal. If for now, all you care about is getting known and reaching users, then your current business goal is to spend money on marketing, at a loss, as it would not necessarily automatically mean revenue, just visitors. \n\nBut anyway, Google Ads will optimize towards one or the other, depending on your setting. This means, you'll likely reach greater number of users with CPC since the algorithm doesn't require them to convert to scale the campaign up. \nIf it optimizes towards a business goal like a subscription, then the reach will be lower, less users on your app. But those users may convert a lot better than the ones targeted to just \"visit\".",

Are visitors being mislead as to the contents? \n\nI'm often too busy with the main parts of my job to branch off into new stuff, but there's a lull at the moment, which I want to use to be more proactive on the analytics front.

Depending on your / your organization’s needs, those KPIs and dimensions to cut data by may vary. I always say that you shouldn’t feel like you need *one* singular dashboard to answer every question you may have, you may be better spinning up a few separate views. So for example, maybe one dashboard is on high level site and visitation stats, another view more narrowly focused on your conversion-oriented pages, etc. \n\nMy second suggestion is that once you’ve built out the above, make it a habit to look at them regularly. Setting up a monthly touch base or data review where you’re reviewing the same metrics and measures on a regular basis is super helpful. It may take a little to get familiar, but once you develop that understanding of what “normal” looks like, you can then start to dig into those abnormal bumps or changes that you see.",

Is there a way to choose a specific conversion (ohter > conversion action \"product\\_consultation\") to exclude them? \n\nWhy would I like to do that? These specific converters don´t need to have the ad displayed anymoyre hence I would like to put them on the exclusion list. \n\nAnyone got an idea how to achieve this?",

If it's remarketing for a specific product, I'll build an audience based on users who have visited that product page.   \n  \nI don't trust remarketing to always work the way it should, so these audiences help to give me manual control. In my opinion, after you build your remarketing campaign, you should A/B test which audience works better - general remarketing, or your unique audience (i.e. users who meet the criteria for visiting a product page minus the audience of converters for that conversion).   \n\n\nGoogle Ads success is 100% built on training their AI to go after the right audience, in the right place, with the right ads.",

In a case where we have multiple CTAs with the same text name, then we'll attempt to create unique triggers and tags for those based on CSS Selector. No need to collect the click text in these cases.\n\nOne additional step for scenarios 1 and 2, is that you'll have to create a custom metric in GA4 for those additional event parameters.\n\nDue to limitations in GA4, you'll want to link to either Looker Studio or BigQuery to get a complete report on the additional event  parameters for click text that were clicked on over time as GA4 only gives you like the last 30 minutes or something annoying like that.",

        "selftext": "(Reposting this, because the other one got removed probably due to links to screenshots)\n\nHi everyone!\n\nWe just discovered an issue that has apparently been going on for quite a while (possibly since we switched to GA4) and we're trying to figure out if this is some weird setup issue on our side, or a potential bug in GA4.\n\nWhen measuring traffic to our study program websites, we pass along a program ID to Analytics to not be dependent on the exact URL. We use Google Tag Manager for our setup, so it looks as follows:\n\n* CMS pushes the program ID to the data layer\n* A variable reads this data layer value as is\n* A tag uses this variable to send the program\\_id parameter along with the event to GA4\n* GA4 has a custom dimension that uses the program\\_id parameter\n\nGood to know is that these program IDs are all uppercase, no exception.\n\nWhat we're observing in GA4, however, is that for one specific program, the program id is lowercase: *it is reported as 'inf', instead of 'INF'*.\n\nI have confirmed that:\n\n* The CMS correctly pushes the uppercase value to the GTM data layer\n* GTM correctly sends the uppercase value to GA4\n\nBut what's more, we also have a BigQuery export and this specific program ID is *the only one that's not exported correctly to BigQuery*. It is exported as a null value.\n\nAs a result, in a dashboard where we're using this program ID as a drop-down filter, one program is completely missing.\n\nMy gut feeling says this is a bug in GA4, possibly related to a reserved keyword or something. That's mostly because as far as I could tell, we're not making any exceptions for the 'INF' program and all the others are working just fine.\n\nWas hoping you guys have any ideas or are perhaps able to confirm this issue. I wasn't able to find a good way to report a potential GA4 bug to Google; the community forum looks pretty dead to me, and I wanted to gather some more info first anyway.\n\n**I'm attaching some images** to show:\n\n* The variable setup in GTM\n* The fact that indeed uppercase 'INF' is sent to GA4\n* The fact that GA4 shows it as 'inf' while all the other values are uppercase\n\n[Variable setup showing that we don't perform a 'change case' operation](https://preview.redd.it/q66xu3tmf7kd1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=0071b7811ade2c7fac73f09c6b7973d46d6ae8ca)\n\n[Value passed to GA4](https://preview.redd.it/c6r8ml7sf7kd1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=79fa3b4225d1b86ce2d5d28609397b45643cd091)\n\n[Value passed to GA4](https://preview.redd.it/elp6v5dtf7kd1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=9512a219297e64c84ac016417b913d74f3a81054)\n\n['INF' has now turned into 'inf' in GA4.

I am asking because I suspect that the \"inf\" is somehow interpreted as infinity which might then appear in one of the numeric columns.\n\nIf that is the case: As far as I know there is no way to explicitly tell GA4 that something is a string. So if GA4/BigQuery think it is a numeric value then the only workaround I know is to add some text add to the value, e.g. a dot, an underscore or similar.   \nOf course this messes up reporting, but if you do it only for \"INF\" value (easy to do with a lookup table in GTM) then the impact is minor.

        "selftext": "I've done a bit of digging and wondering if removing a plugin I was trialling on a WordPress site could have affected my Google Site Kit / Analytics figures? Details:\n\nOn April 12th I spotted that JetPack were now charging to look at my traffic figures in detail, so I thought I'd look elsewhere. We're a small website and don't exactly pull in enough money to make the premium features worthwhile. I already had (and still have) Google Site Kit installed, linked to Search Console, Analytics, AdSense, PageSpeed Insights and Tag Manager. However, I spotted MonsterInsights and installed it for a trial.\n\nI gave it a few hours, realised that it was just a freemium overlay of Google Analytics, and uninstalled it. I opted to just use Google Site Kit / Analytics directly.\n\nHowever... two days later and my figures on Analytics have tanked. On the 13th and 14th April - the two days after my tinkering and the only two since then that I can see on Analytics - we're down a consistent 65% in terms of visitors. It's even labelled as \"Anomoly Detected\". Except that the Jetpack overview for the same dates disagrees with that, and is showing figures roughly inline with what we'd usually have.\n\nWhat could have broken with Site Kit when removing Monster? And any idea how I could fix it? Do I need to reinstall MonsterInsights and tinker with anything? Or remove and reinstall Site Kit?\n\n\\[EDIT\\] I've looked further and individual pages are getting views and being registered on Analytics, but their individual views are all down by huge percentages. The implication being that any tags / header code must still be in place otherwise at least some pages wouldn't be registering traffic.\n\nThanks in advance for any pointers.",

This means GA just sees the initial navigation event but not the download.\n\nI've partially tested a workaround for this by adding explicit gtag calls in the onClick event of the navigation links.\n\nTesting these on their own, i.e. have <a href=\"#\"> to avoid the navigation works as required, the onClick gtag is run and it sends the correct info for file name, extension, link text, link url, etc. which show up in GA.\n\nIssue now arrises when I want to make it work as it normally would and have the normal navigation link in there then the gtag is not fired, the navigation away from the page seems to occur before the onclick event has had a chance to fire.\n\nIs there any 'easy' way around this or am I looking at doing both the gtag and then the navigation in a separate javascript function and removing the href url?  \n  \nMany thanks.

All the prebuilt metrics/events are tracking correctly so I know the GA4 property is connected to the site. The GTM also says it is passing data correctly to the GA4 property.\n\nHowever, I have been trying for WEEKS to get an event (and subsequent conversion) set up to fire when a customer makes a purchase. You would think that this would be a really easy task to accomplish but no matter what I have tried **none** of my events are firing (and therefor cannot be tracked as a conversion). I have tried EVERYTHING I can think of. I've changed around the event parameters/conditions, setting up a button click google tag to fire when they click \"purchase\", I've tried a google tag that fires on page view of just the cart. Absolutely nothing is working.\n\nIf anyone has encountered this before please help me. *Any* advice, tutorial, direction would be appreciated! I'm happy to provide any details needed to help figure this out\n\n**Edit: I got it to work using the native Shopify app, definitely an easy fix to a complicated issue. Thank you all for your help!!**",

It would be helpful if someone can explain how they do it.\n\nI feel like I've set it all up correctly, but I am unable to see the results of my content\\_group values in Google Analytics.\n\nMy site is on Drupal, and I can successfully add data into the data layer using the Data Layer module.  I can confirm that the data is being stored in the data layer array by typing dataLayer in the console.  For example, in the 6th index of the dataLayer array, I can see:\n\nfield\\_author: {id: '314', label: 'Dan Smith', bundle: 'author'}\n\nI set up variables for these values in Google Tag Manager.  The Variable Type is Data Layer Variable.  The Data Layer Variable Name is field\\_author, which should return 'Dan Smith' from the field\\_author object in the dataLayer array.\n\nI set up a Google Tag.  It's a GA4 Event type tag.  It is set to trigger on all pages.  The event name is page\\_data.  Then I enter in Event Parameters.  The Event Parameter is content\\_group, and the value is the variable I created, {{field\\_author}}.\n\nI can verify that this is working so far by using the Preview mode on Google Tag Manger.  If I launch a page on the site in preview mode, I can verify that the dataLayer is being sent to Google Tag Manager, with the field\\_author value.\n\nThe issue seems to be sending this content\\_group value to Google Analytics.  I look at my Google Analytics account for that site, and pull up Pages and Screens, then set the chart to show \"Content group.\"  Nothing shows.  I recently saw on value come through, so it seems to basically be connected, but it should be showing all page views for all values that I've set up in this way.\n\nIs there something I'm missing here?",

I can only do this because I understand how databases work, how to query using SQL, I know what a webhook is etc. \n\nEven doing basic implementations is easier when you can sort of guess what GA4 is doing on the backend. Custom scripting in GTM is also important sometimes.\n\n>What extra skills would you need to boost your salary?\n\nI would learn all the basic client-side tech (HTML/CSS/JS), get familiar with GA4 itself (and get the certs, which aren't overly difficult) and maybe/optionally do some online courses in stats and machine learning. It's not hard to distinguish yourself from most other GA4 practitioners, who tend to be fairly restricted to GA4 itself. Once you start integrating GA4 across CRMs and other systems like that you're pretty safe.",

History Source is one of the variables that can be toggled on. This is the history change loading in new content.\n\nI have a note to myself that using the above history change trigger was necessary when firing page load event tags, like a thank you page hit, otherwise the Page Title would be recorded as the previous page. But it looks like Wix actually fixed this, so I'm updating to use their 'Pageview' trigger properly now. I'd still keep the history change trigger activated on the side so you can see it in preview, like you noted sometimes it might catch a dynamic page load that pageview might miss.",

        "author": "fedaykin00",
        "id": "1csp8tb",
        "selftext": "**# BACKGROUND**\n\nMy organization uses a third-party marketing agency to manage certain advertising (let’s refer to that marketing agency as “Foo”). In the past, the name of that marketing agency was appended to the end of the utm\\_source value in the URL query string (e.g., utm\\_source=facebook-foo).\n\nWe are now beginning to move the marketing agency name reference to a new custom URL query parameter: utm\\_agency. I am passing the value of the utm\\_agency parameter to a new custom dimension (named “Marketing Agency”) in Google Analytics 4 by way of Google Tag Manager. Data is being received in that custom dimension as of March 14. All is good there.\n\nThere is still some active advertising using the previous URL structure with the agency name references in the utm\\_source value in the URL query string (e.g., utm\\_source=facebook-foo). So, for some amount of time in the future, the value will be captured by different URL query parameters: utm\\_source and utm\\_agency.\n\n\n\n**# ISSUE WHEN CREATING A CALCULATED FIELD IN LOOKER STUDIO**\n\nNow, my goal is to create a new calculated field in Looker Studio (let’s call it “Calculated Marketing Agency”) that does the following:\n\n* When the “Marketing Agency” custom dimension value exists and does not equal “(not set)”, set “Calculated Marketing Agency” as that value\n* Otherwise, when the value of “Session source” contains “foo”, set “Calculated Marketing Agency” as “foo”\n\nHowever, any function I have used so far that references the “Marketing Agency” custom dimension results in “Calculated Marketing Agency” only having a value defined *after* the date of creation for the “Marketing Agency” custom dimension in GA4 (March 14).\n\nBelow is an example of one of the formulas I have tested when creating the “Calculated Marketing Agency” calculated field. It returns the desired results on or after the date of creation for the “Marketing Agency” custom dimension in GA4 (March 14). However, it returns no value on dates before March 14, even though the \"Session source\" dimension *does* contain the relevant values before March 14.\n\n    CASE\n        WHEN Marketing Agency IS NULL\n            OR Marketing Agency = \"(not set)\"\n            THEN\n                CASE\n                    WHEN CONTAINS_TEXT( Session source, \"foo\" ) THEN \"foo\"\n                    ELSE \"(not set)\"\n                END\n        ELSE Marketing Agency\n    END\n\nBelow are other formulas I have tested when creating the “Calculated Marketing Agency” calculated field, reversing the order of the function to lead with the reference to \"Session source\" in case that had an impact. However, the results were the same.\n\n    CASE\n        WHEN CONTAINS_TEXT( Session source, \"foo\" ) THEN \"foo\"\n        WHEN Marketing Agency IS NULL THEN \"(not set)\"\n        ELSE Marketing Agency\n    END\n\n    CASE\n        WHEN CONTAINS_TEXT( Session source, \"foo\" ) THEN \"foo\"\n        ELSE Marketing Agency\n    END\n\nI did confirm that the following formula *does* return a value for all dates (before and after March 14) when creating the “Calculated Marketing Agency” calculated field — referencing only the \"Session source\" dimension and not the \"Marketing Agency\" custom dimension.\n\n    CASE\n        WHEN CONTAINS_TEXT( Session source, \"foo\" ) THEN \"foo\"\n        ELSE \"(not set)\"\n    END\n\nI also tested the following formula when creating the “Calculated Marketing Agency” calculated field, just to confirm whether or not the value of the \"Marketing Agency\" was stored as NULL before the date of creation for the “Marketing Agency” custom dimension in GA4 (March 14). However, it still returned no values before March 14.\n\n    IFNULL(\n        Marketing Agency,\n        \"(not set)\"\n    )\n\nIt seems I need some expression to account for the lack of value in the \"Marketing Agency\" custom dimension, since its value is not even NULL prior to its date of creation in GA4 (March 14).\n\n\n\n**# MAIN QUESTION / SUMMARY**\n\nIs there a way to accomplish this so that I have a calculated field in Looker Studio (\"Calculated Marketing Agency\") that defines its value based on *whichever* of the two other dimensions (\"Session source\" or \"Marketing Agency\") actually has the relevant reference value, regardless of whether the “Marketing Agency” custom dimension existed in GA4 on a given date?",

You said you have no idea what the JavaScript that you copy/pasted into your site means, and in terms of time and effort I think that's a much better place to start in terms of your learning journey, while you let an expert do steps 2 - 5.\n\nOnce you have the payment details connected back to your site, the setup is a pretty standard e-comm setup in GTM and GA4. You need the details from PayPal to be pushed into the datalayer as variables in that code you got, e.g. `\"value\": donationValue`. Make sure transaction ID is a unique ID for every transaction.

However, Cliniko has made it difficult to track user's sales conversion whenever a booking is made on our website. Once a booking is made, the page does not reload or redirect to a confirmation page as everything happens within the iframe.   \nUpon further investigation, we found out that Cliniko blacklisted Google Analytics due to the UK-EU GDPR laws. We, therefore, need to create a workaround, which has partially been made by inserting a listening event script on the page, which is then picked up on Google Tag Manager.  \nHowever, the issue with that is that we have no way of tracking what service was booked and how much it was. This would pose a problem as we'd be unable to identify how much a campaign has generated in sales conversion. \n\n  \n",

The first is that Google Ads is simply not tracking all conversions that I'm seeing in GA4. Note: conversions are on a page that is only accessible via Google Ads. The second observation is that my Google Ads Tag (Tool & settings -> Setup -> Google tag) has a diagram that says, \"This tag has never been detected.\" I'm not sure if this tag is redundant with my current setup, but I've been side-eyeing it while trying to debug my conversion issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny and all help is appreciated.

        "selftext": "We are a medium sized website with 35k to 65k users a day, and we had a problem.\n\nWe'd had GA4 installed for a long time, we had just decommissioned Universal and GA4 wouldn't allow us to edit our channel matrix. I mean how dumb was that, right? Unassigned traffic had become the leading channel, accounting for 38% of traffic and paid campaigns were being  assigned to direct and unrelated channels seemingly at random. Our channels were a mess.  We couldn't accurately attribute leads or sales to any specific digital footprint.\n\nBut after a lot of study, a lot of WTF moments, I realized we were stuck in the old days, stuck in the Universal train of thought days...  and we were hurting the accuracy of our reporting. I eventually realized GA4 was our chance to clean house and get it right. I luckily had a digital director and a new sales director that came to believe the same thing after I showed them the data and a plan forward.\n\nWhat was so wrong with the Universal channel matrix? It allowed us to be lazy, to not think through our long term naming strategies. After all, we could fix the channel matrix. Right? Well, yes. With line after line of contains, equals and regex statements that had to be monitored, updated and managed. But there were other problems, misspelled links, improper use of strings, leading to 404 and 500 errors. Let me count the times that I tracked down a jump in 404 errors to a bad link in an advertisement that managed to slip and sneak its way through the QA process.\n\nSo we did a lengthy evaluation of Google's custom tagging documentation and created an internal UTM builder in Excel. But what about all those free UTM builders online, there's tons of them and don't require all that work. Because they are part of the problem. They allowed any person in the organization to build out UTMs without oversite or control. It was the wild west of UTM building, it was a nightmare of report building trying to account for every way an media rep could name a sales campaign. Why not use a free Excel UTM builder? Well, they replicate the functionality of an online UTM builder, still the wild west.\n\nI did start with one Excel builder that I thought was fairly robust, so I wasn't starting from scratch. We locked down everything that was a required field for our UTMs. Regions, sources, mediums, URL structures were all strictly controlled and conformed to GA4 custom channel building documentation. And....well, some people loved it, some people hated it. Many still wanted the wild west. But eventually, everybody came around, especially when the results came in.\n\nWe've been using our custom internal UTM builder for a month and a half.. as of the last two weeks, unassigned traffic went from 38% to less than 1% of all traffic.\n\nSo if you are having the same issues, I strongly suggest getting out of the wild west and look at building your own strict UTM builder.",

Our internal media managers would do this as Partner Co. / Media, and that's how they would track in internally. The person who had my job before, would just simply go into GA and update the default channel matrix and modify based on campaign information. \n\nIn GA4, that doesn't work. Instead, GA4 reports it, but can get confused and assign the traffic to \"Unassigned\" or if it's really confused, to some random channel, usually direct. \n\nThe ways this should have worked would be the company name would be in the utm\\_campaign as a value, with Facebook / Paid or YouTube / Paid for the source medium. \n\nThey would also use all kinds of symbols like +, {} or \\[\\], which google recommends not using. \n\nI went to the GA4 Google Help page for channels and built all the rules they mentioned into the builder. \n\n[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9756891?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9756891?hl=en)\n\nThis including, only allowing sources in the source list, which can be downloaded.

I’d say minimum since mid-March.\n\nHere’s how we set it up: when someone makes a purchase on the website, they get sent to a “booking successful” page. When they land on that page, GA4 is supposed to count this as a conversion. This event has been implemented with Google Tag Manager. At the time of set up, I previewed the new event in GTM preview mode and checked it in GA4 debug view and the event recorded fine at that time.\n\nI logged-in to GA4 today to see the updated purchase event numbers…. And to my horror, it said “1” on March 20th. At first I was shocked, but then I knew this couldn’t be correct because every time a purchase is made, these customers go through a workflow. I checked the workflow and there have been 33 purchases since March 20th.\n\nSo, I tested the GTM preview and GA4 debug modes once more. GTM showed the proper tag firing and GA4 showed the purchase event in debug more.\n\nSo, can anyone tell me what the F\\* could be going on and how I can fix it?",

                "body": "That -20% discrepancy after switching away from your GTM work-around is a classic Shopify/GA4 problem, and it's frustrating because you were so close to the finish line with UA retirement.\n\nIt sounds like you moved from a robust, custom tracking setup back to the standard, client-side tracking offered by the native Shopify GA4 integration, which is the most likely root cause.\n\nClient-side tracking relies on the user's browser, and that’s where the data loss happens.\n\nThe main reasons for this kind of discrepancy are: users closing the thank-you page too fast before the GA4 tag fires; ad blockers, privacy extensions, or browser restrictions (like Apple's Intelligent Tracking Prevention, or ITP) preventing the GA4 script from running; and interruptions from third-party payment gateways like PayPal redirecting users away and sometimes back, breaking the session context.\n\nShopify's native integration typically uses client-side tracking, meaning the transaction data is sent from the user's browser, which is easily blocked or interrupted.\n\nShopify Analytics, in contrast, tracks transactions directly from its server when the order is created, making it the more accurate source of truth for revenue.\n\nTo fix this and future-proof your tracking, you should move to a server-side tagging solution.\n\nA powerful combination for this on a Shopify store is Google Ads Conversion API + Google Tag Manager + Stape.io.\n\nHere's how that combo works:\n\nInstead of having your tracking tags fire directly from the user's browser (client-side), you set up a server-side Google Tag Manager container, often hosted on a dedicated platform like Stape.io.\n\nWhen a user completes a purchase, Shopify sends the data server-to-server to your GTM container first.\n\nThis data includes all the information needed for accurate tracking, such as the transaction ID, value, and other ecommerce parameters for events like `view_item`, `add_to_cart`, `begin_checkout`, and, crucially, `purchase`.\n\nWith the data reliably sitting in your server container, you then use the Google Ads Conversion API to send the purchase conversion directly to Google Ads.\n\nThis is a much more resilient way to report conversions, as it bypasses ad blockers and browser-side restrictions entirely.\n\nYou're sending a direct server-to-server confirmation of the sale.\n\nYou also send a parallel event from the server container to GA4.\n\nThis dual-path approach is key to improving accuracy and is often referred to as 'deduplication,' where you send both a browser event and a server event with a unique ID, and Google only counts one, making sure the more reliable server event is prioritized if the browser event is blocked.\n\nUsing Stape.io is often recommended for Shopify because it specializes in server-side tagging hosting, simplifying the complex setup process of the GTM server container.\n\nIt provides a more stable environment for your tagging server than some other options and often offers pre-built templates for common tracking needs, making the implementation via GTM much smoother.\n\nIn short, this server-side setup makes your tracking resilient, ensures that events like `purchase` are sent reliably, and should bring your GA4 reported sales much closer to your Shopify revenue, potentially minimizing that 20% gap significantly.",

For example, in Funnel Exploration you can set step one as “session\\_start where page\\_location contains /blog/” and step two as your conversion event. That way you can see the share of conversions that originated from blog traffic. In Free Form, you’d build a segment of users who viewed a blog page and then add conversion metrics to compare against non-blog users.\n\nIt feels hacky because GA4 isn’t built to show assisted page value out of the box. If you really want a cleaner read on influence, you’d either push the blog page as a custom dimension on the user/session level, or send that data into BigQuery and stitch paths together there. That’s how you actually see the blog’s role in the funnel rather than just the last page before a conversion.",

On average, how long does it take to complete the demo?\n2. On average, how long does it take to complete the content *after* the demo? Unfortunately, when the full game ends, it doesn't converge on a single virtual page view. Rather, there are multiple page views that, when all viewed, indicate the full game has been completed.\n\nFor this question, I want to focus on #1 because I believe it's much simpler than the 2nd. **How do I answer #1?** \n\nThe above is the TL;DR version. Everything that follows are *my* ideas that could solve the problem.\n\n---\n\nOkay so the tools at my disposal are complete freedom to modify the webpage however I want, Google Analytics (GA4), Google Tag Manager, and Big Query. \n\nBased on my research, this duration is called \"engagement time.\" It's automatically collected by analytics and sent to Big Query. But this is collected on events when the webpage/window has focus. Therefore, for a single user, it might be 1 minute here, 5 minutes there, 30 minutes here, etc. To find the total engagement time for a user, I would have to sum those together. \n\nI then have to do the same thing per user. I then have to average the sums.\n\nBut that isn't the answer to my question: that tells me the *total* gameplay time. I'm looking for the total gameplay time *before the \"free demo page\" was reached*.\n\nAnd what complicates this further is, I know from conversations, that some players restart the free demo and replay it. I bring this up to point out it's not as straightforward as summing the engagement time before the \"free demo page\" was reached. It needs to be per play through. \n\nI know a lot about SQL, but very little about Big Query. That said, I think the data in Big Query can answer this question. Problem is, the query seems so challenging, I'm hoping there's a easier solution.\n\nSomething that seems way easier is to use Google Tag Manager to keep track of a variable like \"free demo engagement time.\" The only reason I don't just go with that idea is, maybe even that is the hard way to solve the problem. For example, maybe there is a tab in Google Analytics that can just tell me the answer?\n\nGiven my limited knowledge of GA4, GTM, and Big Query, it would be nice to know which one to focus on learning. In summary, I'm looking for an answer to this question: **On average, how long does it take to complete the demo?**",

What we're seeing across the board is that events we mark as conversions are not tracking as conversions. The default purchase conversion is working perfectly, but none of our conversions built on custom events.\n\nAll events, including purchase are passing through the Server-Side tag manager. We're passing ALL parameters through as well as signals data. The reason I'm pointing the finger at Server-Side is because we ran the same test on three sites, two had server side and displayed the same behaviour and our direct to GA4 site marked conversions.\n\nThis is a head scratcher for me.\n\nUpdate: the issue was we had obfuscated the Measurement ID in our client tag thinking that it didn't matter since we had one Measurement ID and the server-side sends it there anyway. While almost everything works, conversions do not when you do this. The fix was using the regular unobfuscated measurement ID in the client tags.",

Create for each button one tag and one event and one trigger\n2. Create for all buttons one tag, use dynamic event names {{}} to track each button and one trigger\n3. Create for all buttons one tag, one event name, one trigger and afterwards use the custom event functionality to get events per button\n\nWhat would be best practices here and what would you recommend?\n\nMany thanks!",

They already have GA set up for their website (a Wordpress site), so where/how do I place the tracking code for GTM? I don't want to cause accidental duplicate traffic or otherwise upset their current Analytics setup which is working very smoothly, so where do I place the code as to not create any alterations or duplicate traffic?

Your dev team likely implemented basic tracking but missed critical session attribution requirements.\n\n## Quick Diagnostic\n\nRun this on pages showing \"(not set)\" traffic:\n\n```javascript\n// Check GA4 session continuity in Node.js app\n(() => {\n  // Check for GA4 cookies\n  const cookies = document.cookie.split(';').map(c => c.trim());\n  const gaCookie = cookies.find(c => c.startsWith('_ga='));\n  const sessionCookie = cookies.filter(c => c.includes('_ga_'));\n  \n  // Check page_view timing\n  const pageViewEvents = dataLayer.filter(d => d.event === 'page_view');\n  const sessionStarts = dataLayer.filter(d => d.event === 'session_start');\n  \n  console.log('GA Client ID:', gaCookie ? 'Found' : 'MISSING');\n  console.log('Session cookies:', sessionCookie.length);\n  console.log('Page views fired:', pageViewEvents.length);\n  console.log('Session starts:', sessionStarts.length);\n  \n  // Check if page_location is being sent\n  const hasPageLocation = pageViewEvents.some(e => \n    e.page_location || e.event_parameters?.page_location\n  );\n  \n  console.log('Page location parameter:', hasPageLocation ? 'Present' : 'MISSING');\n  \n  // Check referrer preservation\n  console.log('Document referrer:', document.referrer || 'EMPTY');\n  \n  return 'Check console for session attribution gaps';\n})();\n```\n\n## Root Causes for Node.js Apps\n\nYour 35-40% \"(not set)\" likely comes from:\n\n1. **Client-Side Rendering Issues** (Most likely)\n   - Node.js SSR sends initial HTML without GA4\n   - GA4 loads after React/Vue hydration\n   - First page_view fires without referrer data\n\n2. **Session Continuity Breaks**\n   - GA4 script reinitializes on route changes\n   - Session cookies not persisting properly\n   - Missing page_location parameters\n\n3. **Referrer Loss**\n   - Node.js app strips referrer headers\n   - Internal navigation overwrites external source\n   - URL fragments (#) breaking attribution\n\n## The Fix for Node.js\n\n### 1. Ensure Proper GA4 Initialization\n\nIn your Node.js app's main template/layout:\n\n```javascript\n// Initialize GA4 BEFORE any route changes\n// Place in your app's head or earliest loading point\nwindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\nfunction gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\n// Preserve original landing page data\nif (!sessionStorage.getItem('original_referrer')) {\n  sessionStorage.setItem('original_referrer', document.referrer);\n  sessionStorage.setItem('original_location', window.location.href);\n}\n\ngtag('js', new Date());\ngtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX', {\n  'send_page_view': false,  // Control page_view manually\n  'page_location': window.location.href,\n  'page_referrer': sessionStorage.getItem('original_referrer') || document.referrer\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Handle Route Changes Properly\n\nFor single-page apps (React/Vue/Angular):\n\n```javascript\n// On route change (React Router example)\nhistory.listen((location) => {\n  gtag('event', 'page_view', {\n    page_location: window.location.href,\n    page_path: location.pathname,\n    page_referrer: sessionStorage.getItem('previous_page') || document.referrer\n  });\n  sessionStorage.setItem('previous_page', window.location.href);\n});\n```\n\n### 3. Server-Side Fix (Node.js/Express)\n\nEnsure your Node.js server preserves attribution:\n\n```javascript\n// Preserve referrer headers\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n  // Don't strip referrer for analytics\n  res.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'no-referrer-when-downgrade');\n  next();\n});\n\n// For SSR, inject referrer into initial state\napp.get('*', (req, res) => {\n  const referrer = req.get('Referrer') || '';\n  // Pass referrer to your template\n  res.render('index', { \n    referrer: referrer,\n    landing_page: req.url \n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Why WordPress → Node.js Breaks Attribution\n\n- **WordPress**: Plugins handle session management, referrer preservation, and proper event sequencing\n- **Node.js**: You must manually implement all attribution logic\n- **The Gap**: Your dev team implemented basic tracking but not attribution preservation\n\n## Expected Results\n\nAfter implementing these fixes:\n- \"(not set)\" should drop from 35-40% to under 5%\n- Organic traffic will show proper sources\n- Campaign parameters will persist correctly\n- Management will see accurate channel attribution\n\n## Quick Win\n\nAs an immediate test, check if \"(not set)\" traffic spikes during your highest organic traffic periods. If yes, it confirms the attribution is being lost, not that the traffic is actually direct.\n\nI Hope this helps!",

                "body": "Based on my experience, there are two possible explanations.\n\n1. Second halves of broken sessions. If the user leaves your page open in a tab, and returns to it after the session expires, and reads it without reloading the page, then there is a session with events (scrolls, engagement) and no pageviews. This session has (not set) as its landing page. Very common.\n2. Rogue event with no page\\_location parameter. Play with metrics (views, sessions, users) to see if users and sessions are more impacted. See if any popular non-standard events are firing on your pages.

If interested, I created a tool, Assertion Hub, that automatically tests your tracking implementation for you and notifies you if any errors ( or you can look at the test results in your admin dashboard). We also offer a free trial.   \nNo installation or coding knowledge required. No data is sent to the AI. Avoiding exposing personal information to the LLMs should be more than a suggestion.",

Check anywhere that you might have added the tag directly to the code, in GTM if you're using it, and in platforms that let you give them the measurement ID and they add it for you. \n\nWherever you see Tag 2, replace it with Tag 1.

One solution to try is to have differently named DLVs for different events. Keep all the parameters for your single event in GTM and then only the relevant parameters will populate depending on what the event is. You do end up with events that have blank parameters as a result but the trade off might be worth it to avoid the stacking.",

So, something like this...site code: <a class=\"button\" data-event-name=\"cta\\_click\". data-page-location=\"header\">, then create variables for the attribute {{event-name}} and {{page-location}}, and then use the {{event-name}} variable as the Event Name in the tag, add {{page-location}} to the tag parameters, create the Custom Event trigger, etc. Since each event included only the attribute values associated with event/code, it generated a lot of (not set) parameter values but I don't remember any stacking issue.",

You could do some advanced filtering of raw BQ data, but that might not be simple or scalable.\n\nI might be reading it wrong, but without Segments or by creating a tab with it's own filter for every event and targeted set of parameters, your filtering options are going to be limited because the Filter section doesn't allow for a single filter with conditions like \"event matches: x AND event parameter regex matches 3 or 4\". You'd have to have Tab 1: Filter 1 = \"event matches: x\" and Filter 2 = \"event parameters regex match parameter 3 and parameter 4\". \n\nYou could, theoretically, do something like Filter 1 = \"event matches: button\\_click\" and Filter 2 = \"event parameters regex match parameter 3 and parameter 4\" for all button clicks if you're also collecting and have as a dimension something that would distinguish them from each other like a <class>. \n\nI'd be a little nervous about committing to that maybe because those reports run out of tabs, and it might not be scalable in the long run. \n\nDunno. Just riffing here and I'm sure I don't fully understand your use case. Good luck!",

There’s a lot less friction in getting from Point A to Point B using data studio. Generating reports in the GA4 UI is a pain in the ass. \n\nIf you’re a more advanced user, the free bigquery integration (which previously required GA360) is a godsend. The data granularity provided is awesome. It’s a nice option to have because the GA4 data api in its current state is lacking when compared to the UA API. Lots of incompatible dimensions.",

If they didn't ask you for reporting until now, however, you haven't done anything wrong. It's not implied that you'll provide data and reporting when you agree to post a banner ad for $. \n\nBut you should asap IMO, so that you can see click performance on banners. If everyone's clicking on that banner, are they paying you enough? If nobody is, the company that bought the space might remove it. If what you earn is based on click performance, are there better places on the site to show it...etc., etc.\n\nWhy aren't they in your GA4?  \nFirst, there are clicks and URLs. The click URL is what they provided you (with the banner I assume), and it includes the UTMs needed to track the click source. A User clicking on the banner results in:  \n   \n1. A click event on your site to another site (outbound click)  \n2. A page view event on the destination site (banner people)\n\nIn order to collect and report that click event to your GA4, you need an event listener - a bit of code that's listening for click events - and a GA4 event tag for outbound clicks that sends the click target URL to GA4. \n\nThere are relatively easy solutions for tracking all outbound clicks via GTM. You don't need to create an event for each banner. If you need help, and I can volunteer a little time to get you pointed in the right direction. Feel free to PM.",

So it would most likely get bucketed into unknown... but GA4 has this weird tendency of taking UTMs it doesn't understand and just calling them Direct. So now all the sudden your sources have been changed from blog to direct. \n\nTracking the incoming link correctly would depend on the originating platform and whether it was paid or not.

Not to mention, I started burning out from dealing with the support of the tool - it's a lot of work to keep up with the industry and everyone gets really upset when the tool stops working! \n\nIn any case, I appreciate the feedback and I am hopeful to spend some more time on Omnibug in the coming months.

That said \"Session manual campaign/etc.\" are obeying the UTMs in all cases.\n\nFor display, everything is pulling through fine with the exception that most of the traffic is labelled \"google/cpc\" instead of \"google/display\" for \"Session source/medium\". Again, \"Session manual source/medium\" is correct.\n\nConsidering auto-tagging is turned off, is there any way to have the \"Session...\" data pull through as the UTMs direct (i.e. the way it is for \"Session manual...\")? - or should it be doing that, and something else is incorrect in the setup. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the ad platforms.\n\n(my fallback is simply to look at the \"Session manual...\" data, but I'd like \"Session...\" data to pull through as we want so that any default reports can show it properly and our display pulls through as \"display\" and not \"paid search\")  \n  \nThanks!",

In UA this was possible, but now the option is removed. So if you manually tag URLs but you have auto-tagging enabled then it will just be overridden with the auto-tagged values.\n\nSo it looks like if you want to use your own UTMs in your URLs then auto-tagging needs to be turned off for any ad accounts that have it. That seems like a big deal because data like cost and conversions won't get imported to GA4.\n\nBefore i go ahead and test this out....has anyone done this and knows all the cons for turning this off?

The Google Analytics UTM helps with that.\n\nIf there is 2,500 in total traffic, I might take time to dive in. But 250, I'm going to look for more traffic to send to what ever imperfect measures I have.\n\nEven after conversion starts, I'll still look for statistically significant counts before concluding anything.

Meanwhile, every post on our website has no UTM tags - just the raw link. \n\nIn my understanding, when a user clicks on our link with a UTM tag in Facebook - it counts as one session and one pageview for this UTM tag. If he clicks on any link with no UTM tags on our website in the same session - it counts as one pageview for overall website statistics, but not for the UTM tag in the first link.\n\nBasically, even if he views 20 pages in this session - it still should be 1 session and 1 pageview for the initial UTM tag.\n\nHowever, when I viewed our stats for UTM links in GA4, I saw that number of views for every UTM tag is much higher (about 20% higher on average), than the number of sessions. How is this possible?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. I wouldn't have this question and just assume that my understanding is wrong, if our Facebook stats for link clicks were not also about much higher than our GA4 stats for sessions. So now I think that GA4 stats for sessions might be just wrong.",

A purchase is a clear conversion in this case but I'm wondering if there are any other events that I should tag as a conversion. As I'm a total beginner in this field, I'm having a hard time deciding what a good setup for this is. I'm worried that I'm stalling on the Ads until I feel like I have the perfect setup which I want to avoid. At the same time I want to avoid that I'm running ads and my setup won't allow me to see the information that I need. But then, what information am I looking to see in the first place lol.

And if that's too much setup for them they should drop it and conform to your existing setup. I've worked both sides, and now as the client I'm very controlling of my UTM parameters.\n\nMore specifically: instead of `utm_campaign` all they have to do is place a tracking template in their ad campaigns and create their own `$agency_campaign` parameter. In GTM create a variable for URL Query, and in the field simply input `$agency_campaign`. Save this parameter to a session cookie for every visitor. Pass this cookie along as a parameter with every event (or at least the conversions), you can modify the page view event too. Then set up an event-scoped custom dimension in GA4 (man, I miss session-scoped dimensions).\n\nIt's a lot of setup, but they shouldn't act like it's impossible. And hey, more billable hours. Plus there's a lot of benefit to saving the campaign parameter as a 1st party cookie, for example: you can insert the cookie's value as a hidden field in web forms.\n\nquick edit: either that, or you can always CONCAT the two variables haha.",

        "selftext": "Using GA4 & GAds Tag at the same time\n\nHello everyone,\n\nSo I have a unique problem and thought a new perspective could help. GPT has opinions but Idk which is fact and which is hallucination. \n\nWe track WhatsApp clicks from our Shopify website (tracked using GA4, they just show up in GA4 because its included in the app we use for WhatsApp) as conversions in Google Ads but we also get calls from website top bar so I thought I should track those using Gads because the click event in GA4 tracks those but I had a hard time with custom events. \n\nAnyway I made the mistake of making two changes at the same time so dont know which is which but when I installed the GAds event snippet I just added a gtag with AW-xxxxx to my existing GA4 tag as Google recommends. Another change I accidentally made was in the WhatsApp app I enabled GA4 (it had a separate button for GA4) so what happened was my WhatsApp click disappeared because it started showing up under a different name because of that GA4 enabled option. But since GA4 reports show data quite late I did not see the new event and freaked out thinking my WhatsApp tracking has stopped. (It was a pain finding a Shopify app that had Analytics on for free)\n\nAt the same time my call tracking was working buy it was slightly over reporting (I thought). I dont have exact data from client so I couldn’t quite verify. Also I was tracking clicks on mobile number so it was bound to over report. \n\nAnyway I thought maybe my Whatsapp clicks were now being reported to my newly installed Gtag for calls thats why one disappeared and one was over reporting. Reason being that call tracking was using a function and reporting a url (tel:xxxxx) to the event snippet. But the event snippet was not verifying whether the url being reported was a phone link or not. It just checked url != ‘undefined’ and passed it on as a conversion and I thought maybe our WhatsApp tracking was calling the same function (since its a generic Google function that is called using onclick attribute) just passing on the WhatsApp API link and maybe that function was reporting to my new event snippet & since my event snippet just worked with any url it was firing & reporting to my GAds tag directly skipping GA4.\n\nAnyway, i later found out the issue with my Whatsapp event appearing under new name and fixed that but I also removed call reporting in panic and now will check back again but it did made me think if using both GA4 and Google Ads tag at the same time could have such issues? I did ask the app maker & saw their source code but couldn’t figure out how they were reporting those Whatsapp clicks to GA4 since it was a pretty bad code (all written in one line lol). \n\nShould I just stick to GA4 & try to track phone calls using the built in click event by creating a custom event or is it harmless to use both GA4 tracking & direct Gads tag? \n\nBtw reason I had to rely on GA4 for whatsapp link clicks to begin with was because our Shopify plan did not allow GTM so we used GA4 and switched through multiple contact apps until we found one with Google Analytics enabled automatically.",

You could include parameters, such as the membership level, etc... as needed. Then, mark this as a conversion in GA4.\n\nDepending on how your membership system works this would vary and would likely require changes to your data layer (but maybe you could use what's there already)\n\nFor example, you could create a GTM event tag:\n\nEvent: member\\_signup  \nvalue: {{purchase amount from data layer}}  \ncurrency: USD (or local currency code, or value from data layer if you have multiple currencies)  \nmember\\_level: {{the membership level selected from data layer }}\n\nAny custom parameters you'll need to register in GA4 admin.\n\nThat is what I would do. However, if you are set on using the `purchase` event you can. But, to know for sure the best strategy there we'd need to see what your data layer looks like when it fires after a member signs up. In other words, \"Send Ecommerce Data\" may or may not work based on the data layer implementation. It does sounds like you may need to create the eccommerce variable for the item array and other parameters, though.",

You could trigger a couple of events with dev tools open and make sure that your GA scripts are firing with a 200 code in the network tab. As long as your seeing the call being made with a success code, you can assume that the data is being sent and GA4 is just taking an incredibly long time to process. \n\nSometimes I’ve had better luck using a chrome extension called analytics debugger instead of doing my debugging / hit testing within GTM tag assistant.

We have several subdomains, e.g. blog and shop, but when I imported the data, only the blog URLs showed up in the table with any view values. I reversed the sort from low to high, and the shop & root domain URLs were listed there, but with 0 views. However, when I changed the rows from page location to hostname, in aggregate it showed plenty of views associated with all the other subdomains. So it seems to be recording that views are happening on those subdomains but not on which URL. I then went into GTM preview and clicked around a few pages, and the main GA4 configuration tag did fire on all the various pages, and in the tag details says \"Send a page view event when this configuration loads - true\", but I'm wondering if I need to add a custom parameter to send the page URL with the page view too? But that still doesn't explain why the blog links showed views associated with specific URLs, since we don't have any separate tags or configs for the various subdomains, so the blog pages should be firing through the same tags as any other pages.\n\nAny idea what could be the issue?

As soon as we turn on the GA4 tag, our UA session/user counts increase by anywhere from 25-50% and we get an influx of sessions where the landing page is listed as \"not set\", bounce rate = 0% and the pages/session is 0.00. When our GA4 tag is turned off, we don't see any of these \"not set\" sessions in UA.\n\nI really want to get our GA4 up and running but I still want to be able to rely on our UA data in the meantime (until UA sunsets next year) and this data issue is getting in the way of that. Our developers aren't well-versed in GA4 yet and to this point haven't been able to figure out why this is happening. I would say my own knowledge of GA and GTM are intermediate and beginner-level respectively, but any insight or guidance on this would be very appreciated as I've hit a wall with this.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\\*Edited to fix a typo ",

We have the gtag.js tracking code embedded in our website, and on our GA4 setup assistant page and under \"view tag instructions\", it says, \"Data flowing\" and under \"Data streams\" it says, \"receiving traffic in the past 48 hours.\" Under settings, it says \"2 AUDIENCES ARE DEFINED.\" So it appears that we are getting the tracking data. \n\nWhere I get confused is the Tag Assistant debug mode. I don't know if this was a pre-populated page or what, but all of our website pages are not listed there. I tried adding additional pages but it did not work. Should I just leave this page alone? Are these domains coming from the tracking code, or would they have been manually added? \n\nSorry if this is a stupid question. I'm just trying to understand how this debug mode is related to the GA4s tracking, and if I need to worry if all of the pages of our website are not on the debug list. \n\nHope this makes sense!

Even when I check youtube tutorials about data streams, they seem to show zero connected site tags.\n\nAre you sure your google analytics 4 property has data stream which shows some connected tags. choose your google analytics 4 property -> choose data stream-> click data stream that comes-> in the google tag option there will be option called manage connected site tag. You will see if there are any connected site tags. Usually it shows 0 but mine says 1. If we click on it there is an option to connect more tags.\n\nPlease let me know what you see",

        "selftext": "Hello! I am the sole user of GA in my company and I’m developing the standard for tagging our digital ads. A question from a team member stumped me today and I could use some guidance from my fellow redditors. \n\nA team member posts our blog on facebook, IG, etc and I have them tagging the link they share to track traffic from the site to our blog. Within the blog, however, my team member has a banner ad directing to sell our product and wants to know how many sales are driven by that banner. He asked how to tag the banner. \n\nThe blog already lives on the website, but I want to be able to differentiate between sales from a user on the blog clicking the sales page vs clicking the banner. I also want to avoid double counting, and I fear that tagging both will cause this. What is the best solution here? Should we tag one and not the other?\n\nAny and all advice is appreciated!",

If you can’t set up the internal promotions, you could fire an onClick event for that banner and then used that to create a session based segment to see how many converted. Alternatively, if you want to go more sophisticated you can set a session based custom dimension with the onClick event, assuming you have spare ones, and then run a report for that dimension. \n\nHowever internal promotions would be your best bet as their purpose is to track exactly what you’re after. If you google “internal promotions enhanced ecommerce ga” you’ll find plenty (don’t think I can post links on this sub).",
