I'd store any error message that we shared as event actions and labels.   \n\n\nNow with GA4, I'm a bit. confused. There are a couple of ways I think this can be done:\n\n1. Fire an event for all error responses as an event labeled `\"error\"` with response type and message as custom parameters. \n2. Fire an event for  each action, with the error message as a custom parameter to that event. In this case you'd get events like `Field_1_filled` with a response type and response message as custom parameters. \n\nOption (1) seems like the most scalable way to track those errors to me.

Your repeat customers are where the money is made, especially because you havent spent additional marketing dollars to acquire them a second time compared to your first time customers.  Your marketing economics should budget in a customer acquisition cost that matches up with your numbers.  This helps you define your marketing budget, knowing your margins on your first transaction will be low or negative and you'll make those dollars back up on repeat purchases.  This is why newsletters and email lists are so important - they continue to convert on a customer base thats proven to convert for you already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the ratio of \\~15% of your transactions coming from new customers is about spot on actually.  The bigger concern is your poor conversion rate period.  It looks like you're already in the shopping behavior section of GA, but if not,  Conversions -> Ecommerce -> Shopping Behavior.  What I see is that your product views are actually pretty solid, but your add to carts suck.  Which means your checkouts and transactions will also suck.  So consider how to increase the experience of getting people to add to cart.  Is the button available on a category/home page to one-clck add to cart?  On product pages, is it high up on the product page?  Are there too many options that are confusing customers?  Is it prices?  What kind of promotional language are you running to entice users to add to their cart?  Once the product is in their cart, are you doing upsells and cross-sells?  Too many?  Do you provide flexible checkout options like guest checkout, or are you forcing people to give over too much info?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust go through that user journey.  Look into some heat mapping to understand consumers too, like Crazyegg, which can help you see what are they looking at, mousing over, highlighting, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I'd focus on \"how do I get customers to more easily add something to their cart\" right now.",

The few who have no regrets went from free GA4 to paid Adobe, so there's a $100k investment that's beyond most other clients. \n\nThe reasons they changed analytics platforms: ease of use and \"grass must be greener\". These clients tended to be less active users of website analytics and found the GA4 learning curve to be too steep for their liking. Then, they'd been reading about all the alternatives during the UA to GA4 transition and figured another platform would be worth a try since they had to relearn a tool anyway.\n\nThe reasons they regretted making the shift: heavy lift to realign all internal teams to new reporting, plus creating a new method to monitor and track marketing (not always daunting, but change itself is difficult for most orgs). While they changed Analytics platforms, GAds was still their mainstay for paid traffic conversions.  The tight integration between Google products either had to be replicated with effort, required another tool to buy and learn, or simply surrendered as not feasible.\n\nBig tip: Know what you are trading off between analytics platforms.

So, you can see quickly how all clients’ KPIs are pacing in one place. No need to access separate dashboards, unless more detail is needed. \n\nLastly, scorecards can be sent automatically on a recurring basis to everybody’s inbox as a quick digest of how these KPIs are pacing. The client, agency account team, and agency leaders feel good being in the loop and able to address any red items without having to spend time logging in, remembering which dashboards to look at across multiple clients, and so on. \n\nPlus, huge time savings from manually pulling and arranging all this data into nice charts over and over again. Once the workflow and visualizations are built in Databox, you’re done.  \n\nTo be fair to GA4, I hate it haha but we even run CRM, email, Amplitude and many other tools through Databox because it has so many integrations and can combine data from multiple sources into one visualization. For example, a buying funnel chart showing website visitors down to closed - won deals. \n\nI’ve become a big believer in using CRM to store and organize data and using a separate reporting/visualization tool to create, automate and keep stakeholders informed. It’s crazy how many times I’ve seen companies spending a fortune on Salesforce that can’t tell you basics like avg. days in each sales opportunity  stage and still build 90% of their reporting in Excel. Instead, invest in a cheaper CRM that intuitively stores and organizes data. Use the savings to invest in a visualization tool that reduces time and even automates chart production and stakeholder communication.  \n\nAnyway, went off on a tangent there beyond GA4 lol but if you’re still with me I feel like all these systems are connected.

        "selftext": "I had a conversation with my head of SEO. For the past two years, an entire team worked within blogs and always made sure that, when creating a blog post, every link (whether internal or external) was set to open in a new tab. The guidance was to help with UX and also keep the user in the page - avoiding accidental exits if the user clicks by accident or even intentional that may drive the user away from the page before a conversion point. The exception was for transactional pages: those always open in the same tab.\n\n  \nMy manager said that GA4 tracks every \"link that opens in a new tab\" as a \"new session\", risking losing referencing data within GA. But I haven't found a source for that claim so far, so I thought I could ask here. Does anyone know for a fact **how GA tracks internal links that open in a new tab vs. internal links that open in the same tab**? I'd love some references, please, since I haven't had luck googling them or even Chatgpting them ><",

Here are a few points:\n\nInferior User Interface: The new UI is less intuitive, making it harder to find essential data quickly.\n\nData Sampling Issues: There's more data sampling, which can lead to less accurate insights.\n\nLearning Curve: The learning curve is steep, which can be a significant hurdle for teams used to UA.\n\nLimited Customization: The customization options are not as robust as in UA, restricting tailored reporting.\n\nAlternatives we're exploring include Matomo and Piwik PRO. Both look like they may offer better customization and data ownership.",

To me, Google has effectively changed the market they are going after with GA4. They seem more interested in targeting more an enterprise customer base and competing with the Adobes and higher end products in the space. What is the outcome of this? Essentially you now have thousands of small business who used to leverage GAU to help them track their performance now with a product they cant understand. Google doesnt care about these customers bc they were never making any money off them anyway. Post-migration, Google has created a gap in the market with people now looking for Google analytics replacements. Many tools are currently filling that gap like matomo, heap, plausible, and others. GA4 isn’t for smbs and may require a GA4 admin to pilot or someone really willing to get their hands dirty and learn. As someone that was not a GA specialist but definitely a frequent user of it, Ive been getting the hang of it but it hasn’t been easy.",

So we started working on a way to store it, then I got the bright idea to use the keyword referral to go back to Google and query it to get the ranking of the page.\n\nWe were generating ranking reports on the fly. We then told our boss who immediately helped us patent the idea.  The company did end up building it out - much larger than we'd ever planned.\n\nMy plan was something simple and lightweight - kinda like what your tool does. But in the end they wanted more complex reports and that ultimately caused the end of the project because it got too complex for even a 1/2 dozen developers to maintain.  I still feel if they had left it as we had envisioned it - a simple analytics program with built in live rankings - it could have been huge.\n\nIt did help the company get noticed though, and eventually  a larger competitor bought them (I had moved on by then).",

The custom events have gotten out of hand with a custom event firing for different clicks, rather than one click event firing with a detailed payload. The same is happening for page views and other generic events. We are planning to migrate to a new platform and have an opportunity to build out a potentially better solution. Coming from an engineering background, I feel like our custom events are WAY over-engineered, but I'm not a tagging expert. I just think that there must be a way to implement basic tracking that sends all of the necessary information to google analytics, so that an analyst can filter the data to get the insights they need, rather than waiting on us to build out a new custom event with extremely specific parameters.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions for resources on best practices for implementing/enhancing basic events for ecommerce?

I would recommend using GTM for reasons that have been discussed already. \n\nI just wanted to say that you’re asking the right questions as you approach a website redesign, while potentially moving to a different CMS too. My advice - and I wish I had been more disciplined about this part  - create a well organized Measurement Plan that documents everything that you will be tracking. You shouldn’t be the only person answering that question though - gather feedback from stakeholders from all levels and departments.\n\nResources - I suggest using a Google Sheet template that organizes your implementation from beginning to end. Share it with other stakeholders so everyone is on the same page in 2-3 months (or whenever the new website and tracking are completed) so everyone is held accountable, and more importantly everyone is on the same page. \n\nYou can find implementation templates on Analytics Mania, MeasureSchool, DumbData (underrated resource), or just make your own. I can DM you one if you’d like. These event planning documents will help you determine if you need 1 click event with 5-10 event parameters, or 10 click events with 1-2 parameters. I almost always lean towards the former rather than the latter. But every situation is unique and sometimes the latter is the right solution. \n\nLastly, check out Orbit Media’s blog, in particular the post about tracking website redesigns in GA4. I share that blog post every chance that I get because of how helpful it is to have a guide during a hectic transition period - it will help keep you on track. \n\nGood luck!",

Identifying and eliminating PII is part of any holistic analytics audit for a reason, and If recent legal precedents around User consent to collect data are any indication, even attempting to track non-anonymous User activity is only getting to get harder and more radioactive.\n\nHow are you currently identifying the user in GA4 to determine that you're not seeing the data you're expecting? Does your User log in and have an ID that you've connected to the User? Are you using the User Explorer report in GA4 somehow to determine the data aren't correct?\n\nI'd need to know more about your tracking - and especially how you're identifying the User - to help much, but if you're able to identify the user via the dataLayer, the best way to track a User's activity would be BigQuery I think.

So they killed it, to start making money from non 360 customers who were more advanced.",

This is puzzling because:\n\n* Default Dimension Works - The Session source/medium in the default GA4 reports correctly attributes traffic as cpc.\n* Manual Dimension Issue - However, the **Session manual source/medium dimension** often **defaults to organic** even on landing pages where **we expect cpc**.\n* What makes this stranger is that our organic traffic isn’t manually tagged with source=google and medium=organic, so it’s odd that this would appear in the manual source/medium for our paid landing pages.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone else seen the Session manual source/medium dimension default to organic in GA4, especially in cases where organic traffic isn’t manually tagged?\n2. Are there any known fixes or workarounds within GA4 to address this problem?\n3. Would relying more on BigQuery for session reconstruction be a more reliable approach, or is there a solution within GA4 that we might be missing? If so what are the steps here?\n\nThanks for any insights or advice you can share!",

The activity before login would be assigned to the link (correct) landing page, but would obviously end at login, so revenue wouldn't attribute.\n\nAfter that, it's a little ambiguous; I've never heard of a scenario where the homepage was arbitrarily assigned as Landing Page for direct sessions begun on the site. In the login scenario, Landing Page would report as (not set), as technically there is no Landing Page - the session was initiated internally on the site. All that said, Google reports that if page view events aren't getting necessary URL data, GA4 may attribute Landing Page to the homepage (as you're seeing possibly). Incidentally, I looked at some Landing Page reporting and found more Landing Page - Homepage than I expected for a specific campaign as well.\n\nRe: a fix, based on Google's diagnosis of page view issues, I'd check out how you're sending page view events (i.e., either via Google Tag or standalone event tag), and then in GTM preview mode make sure the URL data is available in the dataLayer when page views actually fire, paying special attention to the page following login (i.e., login success)...oh, is your login page an single page/progressive web app by chance? Those often breed page view tracking issues. While you're there, also check you're not creating a new session at login. It also might be interesting to check out the few pages that are attributing correct Landing Page to see if page view or other events are firing in a different order (again, in GTM preview mode).

I went to [Google Analytics Python API GitHub](https://github.com/googleanalytics/python-docs-samples/tree/main/google-analytics-data) and there were no code samples with the audience whatsoever. I asked 6 LLMs for code samples and I got 6 different answers that all failed to do the API call. By the way, the API call with the sample code of the first documentation is executed perfectly. It's the Audience Export that I cannot do. The only thing that I found on Audience Export [was this one](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/issues/12802) , which did not work. In particular, in the comments it explains how to create audience_export, which works until the operation part, but it still does not work. In particular, if I try the code that he provides initially(after correcting the AudienceDimension field from name= to dimension_name=), I take \nTypeError: Parameter to MergeFrom() must be instance of same class: expected <class 'Dimension'> got <class 'google.analytics.data_v1beta.types.analytics_data_api.AudienceDimension'>.\n\nSo, here is one of the 6 code samples(the credentials are inserted already in the environment with the os library):\n\nproperty_id = 123\n\naudience_id = 456\n\nfrom google.analytics.data_v1beta.types import (\n\nDateRange,\n\nDimension,\n\nMetric,\n\nRunReportRequest,AudienceDimension,\n\nAudienceDimensionValue,\n\nAudienceExport,\n\nAudienceExportMetadata,\n\nAudienceRow,\n\n)\n\nfrom google.analytics.data_v1beta.types import GetMetadataRequest\n\nclient = BetaAnalyticsDataClient()\n\n# Create the request for Audience Export\n\nrequest = AudienceExport(\n\nname=f\"properties/{property_id}/audienceExports/{audience_id}\",\n\ndimensions=[{\"dimension_name\": \"userId\"}]  # Correct format for requesting userId dimension\n\n)\n\n# Call the API\n\nresponse = client.get_audience_export(request)\n\nThe sample code might have some syntax mistakes because I couldn't copy the whole original one from the work computer, but again, with the Core Reporting code, it worked perfectly.

The manufacturer doesn't care. Everyone is now suffering from the compromises resulting from it. \n\nThat's exactly why everyone is angry at GA4. We want our f'ing trunks back (path analysis, easy filters, bounce rates, intuitiveness for use, pages instead of screens, etc.)",

My colleague is convinced that 'Explorations' are Google's poor attempt to rip off Adobe Analytics. Apparently, nobody uses Adobe built in reports, either. My theory is that they're tired of supporting the platform and want to push GA, for all intents and purposes, towards those able to report out of Big Query. The platform is there for occasional users to grab a few quick metrics, but not for any real, efficient reporting. That there are no unsampled reports - at any price - available in the platform says a lot IMO. It also may be that enterprise web analytics are happening more and more via API (R, Python, etc.). I, for one, hate using either interface and want out of that type of workflow ASAP. It feels more and more lethargic clicking around a website to get what I need.\n\nI won't be surprised to see more UA functionality come back in coming months - especially in the standard reports, but the architecture and dimension/metric set is what it is, and I don't understand why they couldn't build on the previous set instead of reinventing them.\n\nIMO, GA4 events' flexibility (inclusion of more parameters) is a significant improvement over UA's archaic Category, Action, and Label.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that there weren't even going to be sessions in GA4, and as of last month, Google Signals is already gone. They're flailing. They'll either cave and start reintroducing UA-ish (or new, better) functionality or GA will die. GA going away seems very possible considering there's not even a paid service tier anymore. Currently, GA only makes money via warehousing/BQ/GCP, right?\n\nIt also seems possible that personalization and user journey platforms (like Full Story, Contentsquare), and their built in analytics, may be ramping up to replace a lot of what bigger businesses/orgs have relied on GA for in the past, and maybe Google knows that. GA4 may just end up there for basic site function reporting and whatever you can dream up using BQ.\n\nOne thing I do know is that I'm not super excited that my job relies on Google apps anymore. I never was, but it feels more and more sketchy all the time.",

A user scans the QR code, their phone decodes a string, which in this case is a web address, it passes the address to the default browser, and the browser treats it no differently than if user had typed it in. Only when the page is loading does GA enter the equation — everything upstream is outside its perspective. You can research best practices for QR codes, but at a minimum you want a dedicated URL in the QR and/or campaign attributes appended (often this is done via a redirect from the shortened dedicated URL in the QR code), associating the entrance in GA with your campaign. Note that the latter bit is not foolproof — a user can always reshare a campaign URL some other way — but leveraging a redirect in the QR code link will make sharing of that dedicated vanity URL less likely, since user would be less likely to see the actual QR link URL",

Oblivious to my blunder, I received a call from our client's CTO the next day, who (very coolly) inquired why they couldn't access their data. As we talked, the realization hit me like a ton of bricks – I was probably the last one in the account and deleted a giant real estate portals analytics history 💀I could practically feel my career flashing before my eyes.\n\nPanicked, I drafted a resignation letter and confessed everything to my CEO. To my surprise, he just laughed it off, saying this would become a legendary office tale. Sure enough, a Google AdWords rep came to our rescue, and with some help from the GA team, the account was miraculously recovered. But let me tell you, those three days had me on the edge.

Simply tracking how many people clicked on the link isn't enough, we need to know how many **converted**, and where they converted from!\n\n  \nI believe the solution to this would be a better booking platform, but I need your assistance with this; because I can't seem to figure this one out.

How do other analysts or ad techs analyze facebook ad spends relative to revenue/leads/etc in GA4 when the only view seemingly available is campaign level? My thoughts on approaching this include a few options:\n\n1. Keeping analysis manual (which is terribly inefficient)\n\n2. Structuring all Meta/Facebook Ad campaigns to live at the campaign level (no ad set breakdowns) so that pairing cost/conversion data in GA4 is possible\n\n3. Something much smarter that the reddit community came up with. \n\nLooking forward to feedback. ",

It also has a terrible interface (IMO) where I'm constantly getting lost on what I was trying to do because the reports aren't working as expected.\n\nSomething has to change on my part. I either need to master GA4, or I need to switch to a new reporting platform, even if it means I have to pay for it. But I don't want to invest time in learning GA4 if others think it's a poor data measurement platform no matter what.

Then update if for your GA4 implementation plan.\n\nRemember: everything is an event now, custom parameters can be set for custom dimensions/metrics. GA4 basic setup will track more than page_view, but check if it works like you would expect. Use recommended event_names... Reuse existing parameter names before creating new custom parameters. Use snake_case for custom event and parameters... It looks cooler and more consistent. \n\nGood luck!",

Google have stated (again through the 3rd party) that their API uses some kind of additional algorithm on top of the (other) aggregation to speed up requests and their accuracy threshold for this is 5% (which implies a degree of inaccuracy is expected in all reports). It feels like this will be something to do with it.\n\nHonestly the fact this is so unclear in the first place is a major failing of Google.

As a result the GA4 time on site numbers are much closer to reality than older version of GA, as the averages used to be way off with all the zeros throwing everything off. \n\nThings i would check:\n\n* Check the time on site metric to see if it has changed before and after the site redesign.\n* If the time on site hasn't changed, check which events do you have set as conversion event. Perhaps the old site had something random tagged as a conversion event, inflating the engagement rate. \n* Have you controlled for any changes in traffic source? Are you running any campaigns to promote the new site (e.g. Social) that might have a lower engagement rate that could skew the results. Many paid sources have lower engagement rate than organic sources.\n\nIt might also just be the case that you've made stuff easier to find on the site, thus more people are able to get what they need without visiting multiple pages or staying longer than 10 seconds.

It doesn't need a 2nd page to be considered 'engaged'... that's the big difference between GA4s new 'engagement metrics' versus the previous set of metrics that UA offered (Bounce Rate in particular). GA4 will do a much better job of measuring engagement.",

The files are generally small, but receive hundreds or even thousands of hits on some days. So the issue becomes more about transfer speeds or limits via a URL, ease of management, simple URLs for linking, and importantly at least some simple analytics such as number of downloads per file, etc. I should say we are based in the US (mid-west) and 95%+ of our internet file requests would be US based.\n\nCurrently we are using AWS S3 storage but this seems expensive and overly complicated for our needs, especially getting simple analytics.

        "selftext": "Hello! I'm relatively new to GA4, and I'm working on setting up configurations for my company's website. There are groupings of webpages (6-8 webpages per group) that I'm wanting to isolate and get user data about, and I'm just trying to figure out the best way to go about doing that.\n\nUltimately, my goal would be to run an analytics report in Google sheets every Monday morning about the previous week's traffic for these groups of pages. I've already set up configurations in Google sheets for all pages for All Users and New Users, so I'm thinking that I have to segment the users that visit these groups of 6-8 pages specifically.\n\nI've managed to create the reports that I want within GA4 itself. I've set up a segment for each grouping of webpages, page title is my dimension, page view is my metric, and it's giving me a line graph where each webpage is a line so that I can see the traffic over time. And that's what I want!\n\nMy main question is: is there a way that I can run this report in Google Sheets? I've looked at the segment dropdown in the \"Create Report\" sidebar and looked for my newly created segments, but they aren't there. Am I not understanding segmenting correctly? Should I just stick to my reports in GA4? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!",

        "author": "UptonDogW",
        "id": "14n7gik",
        "selftext": "In the old UA API, we were able to retrieve unsampled metrics on how many pageviews and unique users we had on various pages/paths on our site.  So for example we could say, give me the pageviews for each date from June 1st to June 30th, for the following paths:\n\n/users/303\n\n/users/304\n\n/users/305\n\nThe way we used to do this in the UA API was to say, \"give me the metrics for all paths that begin with /users/\". And then we would loop through the results, and make a second request for the next page of results if needed.\n\nBut in the new GA 4 API we are running into sampled data issues whereby the response is always including the following metadata:  data\\_loss\\_from\\_other\\_row: true\n\nThe quality of the sampled data, for this particular purpose, is terrible. We have tens of thousands of URLs / paths, and if a given path had 10 pageviews, I want to know it was 10 and not some essentially random number like 0, 2, or 17.\n\nI have seen some questions on this Reddit about topics like this, such as this one:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/11aiedo/anyone\\_else\\_experiencing\\_the\\_ga4\\_api\\_being\\_way/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/11aiedo/anyone_else_experiencing_the_ga4_api_being_way/)\n\nBut I'm still uncertain and confused if what I am trying to achieve is possible:  Even if I narrow down my API query to only be:\n\n\\- dimensions: just 1 date\n\n\\- metrics: just 1 metric (pageviews or unique users)\n\n\\- filters: pagePath, \"EXACT\" match type, for a given, single path string\n\n... Is there no reliable or known way to get unsampled data out of the API?  E.g. just tell me how many pageviews there were for a given path on a given date. Even if I have to make 5,000 API calls for each path instead of batching them together.  Any ideas?",

                "body": "You're not alone in seeing a big discrepancy between Google Ads clicks and what's reported in Google Analytics.\n\nYour understanding is partly correct, but the issue is a bit more complex than just new users.\n\nA click in Google Ads doesn't always translate into a user session that Google Analytics can track.\n\nThere are many reasons for this mismatch.\n\nOne of the biggest culprits is the user experience after the click.\n\nIf your page loads too slowly, a user might click the ad and then hit the back button before the Google Analytics tracking script has a chance to fire.\n\nSimilarly, ad blockers are a major cause.\n\nMany users have them installed and they can prevent the GA script from loading altogether.\n\nAlso, a user might accidentally double-click an ad.\n\nGoogle Ads will charge for both clicks, but the user's browser only opens the page once, resulting in a single session in GA.\n\nTo get a more accurate picture and improve your campaign optimization, I would recommend setting up the Google Ads Conversions API.\n\nCombining this with Google Tag Manager and a server-side solution like Stape.io is a powerful way to combat these issues.\n\nThe reason this works so well is that instead of relying on the user's browser to send the data directly to Google, you send the data from your server.\n\nWhen a user clicks your ad, the browser sends a request to your server.\n\nYour server then processes this event and sends it to Google Ads via the Conversions API.\n\nSince this happens on the server, it bypasses many of the common tracking problems like ad blockers and slow-loading scripts.\n\nThis allows you to track conversions more accurately.\n\nYou can set up events like `page_view`, `view_item`, and `purchase` on your server and send them to Google Ads, giving you a much more reliable source of conversion data to use for optimizing your campaigns.\n\nThis helps bridge the gap you're seeing and gives you a clearer view of what's working, so you can spend your ad budget more effectively.",

Furthermore Google Analytics can help you optimize your website by finding patterns in dropoff. Google Analytics is about big patterns, not about individual data points. It's not an accounting system.\n\nSome sites can only measure 50% of the real traffic, but when they have enough traffic can still make great quantitive analyses.\n\nIt's important to be aware what percentage you are measuring and if it's a stable percentage. You can check that by counting your purchases or filled in forms in your backend and compare it to the conversions you measured with Google Analytics.",

Anyone found how to recreate a real-time report that shows up to the minute of users on a web property in GA4 or is that non-existent now?

I don't like the new 4-8 hour intra-day delay of stats in GA4. Universal Analytics was up to the minute. This is a bummer because if there's hot content on my site getting visited , it's telling me something happening that day for that topic (this is the case for most of my sites content). 30 minute real-time reporting works, but I would love to see these stats up to the minute.\n3.

We’ve run into a reporting issue in GA4 these past 2 weeks with one client that we cannot seem to figure out. This client runs 2 responsive display campaigns in Google Ads; these have been running since May and have picked up decent performance. The utm parameters on these ads are source=display, medium=cpm. However, we recently found out that traffic has been recorded since campaign launch as Paid Search, with google / cpc as the session source / medium. It’s important to note that this client does not and has never had ANY search ads running, neither in Google nor Bing. We looked in the traffic acquisition report in GA4, and there is only a handful of data getting recorded since May as Display with the correct parameters. A majority of their traffic acquisition report is Paid Search. We also checked on the real-time report in GA4 upon clicking the ad, and that source / medium is being recorded as google / organic! Has anyone also had this problem before, or have a suggestion on what else we can look into or what this may be? Thanks in advance!",

In short, I didn't try to create a \"faux\" variable in GTM to have it mimic the existing utm data gathering. Honestly, not worth the time, given I assume google will eventually bring that into the connector by default.\n\nAs for capturing and reporting UTM term and content in GDS, you need to create your custom variable in GTM that targets the URL query of the UTM name. Then you can create an event in GTM that passes the new event parameters to GA4 as custom. This tag will be triggered by a view on all pages.\n\nYou just need to be sure to create these custom dimensions in GA4 so that GTM can populate it with the info it finds. In my version, I created a custom event for it as well, but I believe you can always just associate the custom dimensions with an existing event in GA4 that makes sense.\n\nHappy to explain further or share screenshots if it helps.",

We have all those ads driving traffic to a no-index page (you only get there if you know the URL directly) set up just for that campaign.\n\nThe ad company is showing on their dashboard something like 1100 clicks to our website.  Our analytics (GA3) is only showing 280 visits to that page.\n\nThe company's response to the discrepancy is:\n\n>With ***In-app advertising***, ads are appearing within a mobile app like Weatherbug or ESPN, and upon click links out to your website, one of the two things occur:\n\n1. It will take the user out of the In-App environment and launch a web browser – In some cases, UTM parameters are stripped, which causes breakage in tracking or if the web-view does not accommodate all the necessary SDK parameters to emulate a website, it can break the tracking.\n2. Second, it will launch a native browser, which emulates a mobile-web environment within the app, and in some scenarios the post click engagement are tracked. But, when user exits out of the native browser, user is still in the app. The shortfalls of this are: (1) a cookie doesn’t get dropped at time of impression, and (2) if they do click, a cookie is dropped, but only for that in-app browser session.\n\nI don't feel like this would affect the basic page views statistic? We're not tracking via special UTMs or anything like that. Just looking at the pageviews/visits to that private landing page.\n\nAm I missing something or are they trying to blow smoke?",

At the very least it should still be registering the page view.\n\nThis was the final part of the email:\n\n>Long story short, as soon as a user clicks on the ad, all the initial user information is tracked such as IP signal, user agent id, geo, location, OS, user ID, UTM parameters etc. Because of the two scenarios outlined above, post-click engagement metrics such as bounce rate, avg session duration, goal completion rate can’t be tracked leading to underreporting which is not at all linked to traffic quality but the tracking limitation on GA.  \n>  \n>Workaround: Install tracking pixels on the webpages you want to track. This will help you give a count on the number of conversions on each webpage. We can help you with tracking pixel setup.\n\nThey're REALLY pushing to get us to install their pixel so they can \"measure a web lift\" but it feels like they're just wanting to find ways to take credit for other traffic. We measure all traffic not attributed to a campaign already, so I don't see how this fixes anything.",

What I’ve done is create GA4 properties in Analytics, copied from our UA properties.

I've function tested it using the Tag Assistant chrome extension and checking the actual GA reports.

It's really frustrating as we have Google Ads running for her and it's not tracking properly.  \n\n\nI've read a bit that Wix has a weird approach in which it creates a separate desktop and mobile website (rather than a true responsive design approach). I suspect this is the issue, but I do not know how to fix it?   \n\n\nAny ideas how to fix this \"Thank You\" page conversion tracking on mobile? Should I switch to a \"Submit\" button event Click instead of a destination URL? I don't like this idea as much because it can fire multiple times (eg. they don't fill out the form correctly first try) - leading to a few false positive conversions.  \n\n\nThanks for any help!",

I even have the tracking ID. Is there anyway I can import that tracking ID to pull the data/configure?

        "selftext": "I have recently been handed over a Google Analytics, Ads and Hubspot account for a business I'm responsible to plan and execute digital marketing for. A week ago I set up a campaign in Ads and started noticing that there are apparently \"0\" conversions \\[set up on account level with source Analytics\\]. I checked Hubspot and found that there have been 3 new contacts created via paid search. This led me to check Google Analytics (which I honestly don't use regularly). \n\nWhat I figured is this: Conversion Goals set up, as page visits (both events & destination) & PPC phone call, by an agency before me (all checked Recording = On and I've not touched anything after the handover) suddenly stopped recording conversion goals on Jan 24th. \n\nI have researched some stuff online and re-installed some tags - using the Google tag manager and copy-pasted in Site <header>  HTML (in Hubspot settings) 3 days ago. I have no coding background and I did the best I could reading Google's instructions. It is still not working - I have visited the \"destination\" URLs that GA is supposed be tracking but nothing shows up in the goal tracking graph.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I am saying that I am losing sleep over this. I have a lot riding on this campaign and if I can't prove that it is getting any conversions  - then really whats the point :( Please help!!!! I don't want to be more frustrated than I have to be sitting home all day in this lockdown! Thanks in advance.",

Our content team is requesting that we put the two together into one property so that they can look at traffic levels and performance for specific articles / landing pages without having to flip between 2 different properties. Has anyone combined their website + amp traffic with a Roll-Up property? If so, were there any issues with that? I realize that I would have to resync our integrations with our other Google products (Ads, SA360, CM360, etc.), but I want to see if anyone has experience with this or would advise against it? This might be a silly question - but would love any insight.",
