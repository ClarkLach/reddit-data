This means we can only track visitors who¬†**accept**¬†the consent.\n\nOur internal compliance team is advising that tracking visits in GA4 without user consent is¬†**illegal**. However, I believe monitoring all website visitors via GA4 might not necessarily be a legal issue (depending on the data collected).\n\nCould someone clarify the legal position here? Is it always mandatory to have user consent before tracking in GA4, or are there any exceptions based on privacy regulations like GDPR, ePrivacy, or other regional laws?\n\nThanks in advance for your guidance.",

I've connected Google Analytics to Google Ads and things were going fine, until I was hit with the issue of \"missing consent signals\", as we are doing ads in Europe as well.\n\n  \nI think what is required of me is to have a popup for visitors saying \"do you allow cookies etc.\" and Google is kind enough to automate this process by suggesting a bunch of providers.\n\n  \nThe following just occured to me... I'm using a lot of different apps through my browser, and it has been a very long time since I've encountered a cookie popup. I visited these websites again through a European VPN + Incognito and I still don't see them. Do they not bother with it at all? Or are they handling this in some other way?\n\n  \nAlso, does this prevent the ads etc in any way? Or does it just block me from viewing the analytics from those particular users?\n\n  \nI'm fine with a cookies popup and all, but it occured to me that many apps similar to ours (to give a few examples: Lovable, n8n, Zapier...) are not doing this at all. Does this mean they are not seeing their analytics as well? Or rather that they are not using Google Ads / Analytics, which enforces this?\n\n  \nI'm a newbie in this field and I would appreciate any pointers. thanks!",

You don't need to use consent mode necessarily to handle statelevel laws but Google have made it super easy with a 'region' parameter in the consent mode call!\n\nIdeally you should have a multi region cookie consent with consent mode setup that does the following:\n- show cookiebanner to only visitors that need to see one\n- when you need to show the cookie banner and cookie policy page make sure its the right one to the right user based on their region (I.e. if they come from eu show gdpr style banner and cookie policy and if from California show them ccpa style etc.)\n- make sure your tracking is setup to respect these user cookie consent choices (if they are presented by these cookie banners) based on the type of cookie consent law. Use consent mode to help signal google tag hits properly at regional consent level of control.\n\nI would be happy to have a chat if it helps and have helped other us businesses apply this multi regional cookie consent setup before.",

        "selftext": "We‚Äôve been experiencing tracking discrepancies in GA4 ever since implementing Consent Mode. Our GA4 performance has dropped significantly, and we suspect it's due to consent-related issues.  \nWe‚Äôve tested both CookieBot and CookieYes, and both report around a 30% consent rejection rate. However, GA4 isn‚Äôt reflecting that data properly‚Äîinstead, we‚Äôre seeing a much lower user count than expected.\n\n  \nOur Setup:\n\n* **Cross-domain tracking in GA4** (each domain has its own GTM). \n* **Main issue is with our primary website** (our booking partner‚Äôs data seems fine). \n* **Currently using CookieBot.** \n* **Cross-domain settings** are configured in GA4 and within the conversion linkers in GTM. \n* **CookieBot is implemented via GTM** using the CookieBot CMP tag type, triggered by \"Consent Initialization - All Pages.\" \n* **GA4 tags & Conversion Linker tags** are triggered on \"All Pages.\" \n* We‚Äôve tested **custom event triggers (cookie\\_consent\\_update)** per CookieBot‚Äôs suggestion, but they advised using \"All Pages\" instead. \n* Followed **MeasureSchool‚Äôs setup tutorial** and configured consent settings in GTM, ensuring tags use built-in consent settings with no additional consent required. \n\nTroubleshooting So Far:\n\n* Added **GA4 tracking via an HTML tag** instead of the GA4 config tag. \n* Set **Conversion Linker to override cookie settings** with \\_gcl as the prefix and included the domain. \n* This helped *somewhat*, but we‚Äôre still seeing discrepancies. \n\nAt this point, we‚Äôre unsure what we‚Äôre missing. Are there additional Consent Mode settings we should check? Has anyone dealt with a similar issue and found a fix?  \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",

I get the data I need now from Adsense, Search consule or Cloudflare with less hassle that GA4. \n\nAnyway, last week I logged into GA and was confronted with lots of orange warnings about EU consent for Analytics and Advertising.

I thought that was it .... apparently not. \n\nThese warnings have now appeared (Analytics cookie consent signals inactive), ( Ads cookie consent signals inactive , Ads measurement consent signals inactive, Ads personalization consent signals inactive\"\n\nI've followed their \"instructions\" as best I can for \"setting up consent mode\".

Are you using a Cookie Management Platform like CookieBot, CookieYes or did you make a custom solution?\n\nThe warnings you receive are from Google's new requirement (since March 2024) to send Consent states along with the hits from the tags. Google is now adhering to laws in Europe which have been in place since 2018.\n\nIt's actually fairly simple to setup if you already use Google Tag Manager for all your scripts. Basically if a new visitor lands on your website, you use Google Tag Manager to set default states for the different types of cookies/storages. I.e. ad_storage = denied etc.\n\nIf you fire a tag (from Google or Microsoft) it reads the default state and makes sure the tag respects that default state.\n\nNow. If your cookie popup shows and a visitor consents to a type of cookie. Typically a CMP template will send an update event like cookie_consent_update with the updated consents for i.e. ad_storage = granted. Tags from Google and Microsoft will automatically pick up on these consent changes for the different storages and will change their behaviour.\n\nIt's called Google Advanced Consent Mode v.2 and there are guides from Simo Ahova if you have a custom solution or use the step by step guides if you use CookieBot or something like that.",

I reached out to my CMP rep about this and it seems like event tracking should be business as usual, what will be impacted is understanding the traffic source of that event. i.e. I can see that a form submission event happens but I might not know what channel it came from.\n\n  \nHowever, since setting things up I have noticed a drop in event tracking on analytics. I am seeing less form submission events compared to previous months + there is a higher discrepancy between the count I get from manually checking submissions on the website.\n\n  \nCan anyone provide some insights into the impacts and if there is any way to mitigate it?",

However on this one site, it is not. It isn't sending any hits at all. Once the user interacts with the cookie banner and we send a consent update signal, the Gtag sends a hit correctly in accordance with the user's consent selection - if they deny cookies then a cookieless ping is sent, if they accept cookies then a full hit sent.\n\nIf no default consent state is set then GTag does send a hit but this is out of line with the correct configuration.\n\nCan anyone think of a reason why GTag just may not be sending a hit at all on the default consent state?",

Google uses data modeling for these users.  \n  \nBut what does the modeling look like exactly in the reports?  \nAre the modeled data displayed in the active users, events, ... reports or will i see a drop in tracking even though the advanced mode is active or where are those modelled data displayed?  \nOr will google model only user behavior like conversion (this answer i received from CookieYes)?\n\nSecondly, is the advanced mode activated only through the consent signals in Google Tag Manager or do i have to activate something directly in Analytics Account? Some of the settings in Analytics are hidden on different places in different accounts and its always changing - so I'm not sure if i have everything set up correctly for advanced mode.",

Since google is still theoretically receiving all events (it just can‚Äôt string them together for users and sessions) event stuff shouldn‚Äôt have to be modeled (event counts, specific purchases or whatever). Although, I can‚Äôt remember where it is but one of the documents mentions ‚Äúconversion modeling‚Äù which seemed to imply some level of making up conversions, though that might just be for google ads. (I‚Äôd love to hear someone speak definitively on that point).

That definitely helps clarify things.\n\nJust to dive a bit deeper - I'm currently seeing a pretty big discrepancy between GA4 and our website‚Äôs backend sales.

We‚Äôre seeing a cookie banner acceptance rate of roughly 50%-60%.\n\nDoes this sound normal, or should the GA4 reported revenue typically be higher? It's crazy to think that if we removed Google Consent Mode V2 and reverted back to how things were two months ago, the reported numbers would be a lot more accurate. It's hard to pinpoint whether there is a tracking setup issue, or that's just the way tracking is now...",

If anyone has any resources they've found that make this easier to understand, please share them.\n\nAside from server side tracking and enhanced conversions, is there anything we can do to at least see something from users that haven't interacted with our consent banner? If someone declines, I get it, they don't get tracked. But most people seem to just ignore the banner entirely. Are there any settings that I'm missing that would allow us to see at least some data from these users or is this just the future and the days of data are behind us?",

I am getting this prompt to set up consent mode and I'm wondering if this is the cause of the demographic data not showing up? I'm a little bit confused if it is since shouldn't consent mode only apply to EU data?  \n  \nAlso I know thresholding could prevent demographic data from showing up as well though I feel like that shouldn't be an issue as my page has had 750 views in the last 30 days.\n\nSo could someone let me know what I need to do to have demographic data show up? I'm ok to see everything except EU data for now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gf5t7j4qiod1.png?width=2218&format=png&auto=webp&s=dec0c1693e7a7d88b0822c0217ffc96fe92b01e7\n\nThanks!",

How does the lack of Consent Mode influence websites that are not using Google Ads or similar services, only GA4?\n2. Is it mandatory to use a certified partner platform to handle Consent Mode, or can it be implemented by ourselves?\n3.

On my website (Wordpress) I am using Sitekit to implement the analytics and Adsense code and when I visit the site, both the cookie banner and ads appear just fine. I have also enabled the Consent Mode in Sitekit Advanced Settings and installed the API plugin.\n\nI don't know what else to do. The error persists in Google Analytics. Do I also need to use a dedicated Consent Plugin on top of all that? Isn't the Adsense generated Consent banner enough?\n\n==== Update: It now works! =====\n\nThank you all for your replies.  \nIt seems that the last step was all that was needed: Enabling the Consent Mode in Sitekit Advanced Settings and installing the API plugin\". It just took **48 hours** indeed to be aknowledged by GA4!",

This is crucial if you're tracking conversions and creating audiences through GA4 since consent mode impacts both first-party and third-party data. If you're not set up with this, you might face issues like ad suspension. Even though you've got your floodlight tags covered, check that your GA4 is also aligned with these consent rules to avoid any disruptions.\n\n  \nSeems like there's a bit of confusion around certified consent mode services. It boils down to ensuring you're using a service that correctly gathers user consent while interacting with Google Ads. If your audience setup involves GA4 data, it's best to incorporate a consent mode that adheres to these guidelines, even if it‚Äôs not directly about third-party data. This keeps you fully compliant and in safe territory with Google Ads.\n\n  \nI'm Ben, and I work at StatsPro, which is a Google Analytics alternative.

We haven't launched OneTrust yet due to a number of factors but are about to. Or were, until we hit a ridiculous snag we didn't see coming.\n\nOur ecomm platform (Tessitura, a CRM/ticketing solution used by theaters & museums) recently made a change which breaks our purchase tracking in GA4. We can work around this by adding our GA ID into the back end of the Tessitura ecomm interface, so that our GA tags load via the GTM container that's embedded within its code, and suppressing our own GA4 tags in GTM on our ecomm subdomain. We have zero control over any of the resulting tags, but the data comes through.\n\nProblem is...if we do this, we can't load OneTrust on our ecomm subdomain, because it's setup to load via GTM. I'm not optimistic but I'm wondering if anyone knows: **if we load OneTrust and set resulting consent mode triggers in our GTM container, will our GA4 property still respect those triggers if the tags load through the other, embedded container and not through our own?**\n\nThanks in advance for any knowledge you can share.",

You'll lose some data that requires cookies, like returning visitors, but without a consent banner you'll also collect data from twice as many visitors since roughly 50% decline consent.\n\nThe cookie banners do not just give consent to cookies but to tracking and using the data. It's not just cookies people have to consent to. That's why you can't use it with GA4 even if you somehow disable the cookies. By using Google, you share the collected data with a third party, which is the google company. You are not allowed to collect user data and give it to another company without consent.",

Because these tags have built in consent checks and adjust their behaviour accordingly these will respect the not given consent and only sent non personal metrics/pings to ga4 en GAds.\n\nWhen the users consents it will enrich the data with personal stuff. Being able to sent these pings before consent is given Google can model your traffic (that you couldn't measure before).\n\nFor other tags that haven't got built in consent checks you still have to set the consent states that it should have to fire.",

This way your visitors don‚Äôt have to wait for the page to reload after they consent.\n\nEither way, you just need to make sure the first pageview is sent somehow so GA can receive the referrer and campaign info.",

Some information will be missing but it seems better than not having. This way you don't have to have any workaround, just update the consent to granted as soon as they accept it.",

I‚Äôve seen big differences depending on whether the tracking code is dropped directly in theme files, added via Site Kit, or routed through plugins like MonsterInsights. Each approach can affect whether the tag fires consistently, double-fires, or misses sessions altogether.\n\nClicks vs. sessions rarely match perfectly (ad platforms count every click, GA filters out bot traffic, can be blocked when users have an ad-blocker active, etc.), but if you‚Äôre seeing wide gaps, it‚Äôs usually a sign that the GA tag isn‚Äôt firing on all pages or isn‚Äôt firing early enough.  \n  \nCommon things to check:\n\n* Make sure GA4 is in the `<head>` (not footer) so it fires before users bounce.\n* Verify only one instance of the GA tag is firing (GA4 Debug / Tag Assistant / GTM Preview can help).\n* Check consent settings or caching plugins that might delay/strip scripts.\n\nHow are you currently adding GA into your WP site? That‚Äôll help narrow down where accuracy could be improved - and I'd be happy to provide additional thoughts here in the thread; GA4 + Wodpress are where I spend the majority of my time.",

It does not automatically apply the same filtering or estimation algorithms as the GA4 UI. This means you are responsible for defining and calculating sessions based on the raw event data.\n\n\nSession Definition and Calculation:\n\n\nGA4 UI: GA4 defines a session based on a session_start event or the first event in a new session, along with criteria like 30 minutes of inactivity to end a session.\n\n\nBigQuery: While the ga_session_id is available in BigQuery, directly counting unique ga_session_id values may not perfectly align with the GA4 UI's session count. This is because the GA4 UI's session logic can account for scenarios like multiple users having the same ga_session_id if their sessions started at the exact same timestamp, or inferring a new session even without an explicit session_start event if no active session exists for a given event",

However you'll find the GA4 transaction value will match to your cart value if you use server side tracking. If you use client side tracking you'll lose about 10 to 15% of transactions. \n\nAlso Meta uses a different attribution model, usually 7 day click, 1 day view so GA4 doesn't see the 1 day view as no clicks occurred on your site. So Meta will claim 100% of the attribution based on the above conditions whilst GA4 will reduce it based on DDA\n\nIf you add up all the reporting revenue from all your ad sources you'll find the total value is over your actual revenue.

You will need to register that formEvent parameter in GA4 as a custom dimension for GA4 to record it. The parameter will show up in the debug view whether you have registered it or not, but it won‚Äôt appear in your reporting unless it‚Äôs registered.\n\nIf your event doesn‚Äôt send any custom data, you don‚Äôt need to register anything.

Do the 'gcs' & the 'gcd' actually reflect the proper consent state for both the On Page Default state (Banner in the window OR declined) and the On Page Update (Banner (partially) accepted).  \n  \n\\- For the functionality of Consent Mode you can add the 7 states (ad\\_storage, analytics\\_storage, functionality\\_storage, personalization\\_storage, security\\_storage, ad\\_user\\_data, ad\\_personalization) into the Google Tag for GA4 (in GTM) as 'Shared event settings', these will also reflect in the request header in the developer tools (Network tab > search: 'collect' > payload tab).  \n  \n\\- Why would I focus first on CoMo? This is because when the 'gcs' and the 'gcd' reflect propper states, the advanced implementation with the machine learning can/will be activated.  \n  \nThat means even though the banner might have a high bounce rate, you still should be able to have more than 20% of your actual data.\n\nBut you stated you have been out of the game for a while and a lot is changing, no jokes. The largest changes for now are as you suggested:  \n\\- cookie- and/or ad-blockers;  \n\\- secondly; also the depreciation of 3rd party cookie by most browsers.\n\nTracking has become substantially more difficult, where I force all my clients to work with CookieBot (far from perfect and absolutely too expensive) for a smooth Consent Mode implementation;\n\nImplement all tags via Google Tag Manager (from Google Ads, to LinkedIn, to Facebook, Hotjar...you name it), so that there is controle on Consent Mode.\n\nImplement Enhanced Conversions for all LeadGen en Ecom conversions (e.g. purchase).\n\nAnd nowadays it becomes almost vital to implement 1st Party mode via Server Side tagging.\n\nBut all this is still far from perfect, where I have a client that is in the driver's-licence business and most of his clients are 18 year old. He gets really affected by browser restrictions and loses a big portion of his data.\n\nMomentarily there is not a base solution for this, where the obfuscation of measurement is high enough to not lose an extreme amount of data.\n\nSince I face this on a daily basis and my clients are panicking, I'm working on something that would fix this and many other problems for WordPress websites. Momentarily there is no one stop solution. I can let you know once it's done. Just sent me a DM.",

Forgive me if this question is a duplicate, and please direct me to a similar thread or discussion with the problem I will explain.\n\n\n\nI understand that the number of clicks in GSC and sessions in GA will never be the same because of the data collection method and others.\n\n\n\nCurrently, I see that the number of clicks on my website is higher than sessions. I assume that not all clicks will become sessions, because in my understanding, sessions are related to pageviews, so if clicks do not end in pageviews, then there are no sessions there, but clicks have occurred. Please help me correct my statement if I am wrong.\n\n\n\nHowever, I found that there are days when organic sessions are higher than clicks. I assume that organic sessions can occur from anywhere not just from Google search pages, while clicks in GSC only count clicks from Google Search pages. However, after I filtered only organic sessions that came from Google search pages, I found that the number of organic sessions was still much higher than clicks in GSC.\n\n\n\nAs an illustration, the difference between clicks and organic sessions that I observed on my website is around 10-15% with more clicks than sessions. While this one data point shows organic sessions are higher than clicks with a difference of approximately 24-25%.\n\n\n\nMy question is, what are the possibilities for this to happen? Then, if I have to do debugging, where should I start?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.",

        "author": "GullibleEngineer4",
        "id": "17wu26a",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nSo, I had to dive into Google Analytics 4 for a project and I am really impressed with what you can do with it with its free Big Query integration but on all platforms, I keep hearing people aren't happy with Google Analytics 4 which is a bit surprising for me. Since, I have never worked with Universal Analytics so I can't make a direct comparison here, but I am dead sure whatever you could do with Universal Analytics, you could also do easily with Google Analytics 4 as well using Big Query and ChatGPT (if you are not proficient at SQL). \n\nMy goal is to put together a comprehensive guide and may be a free custom GPT in future (if time allows) which would enable anyone to dive into extremely detailed insights on their website and mobile apps, insights which were previously only possible with premium tools like Adobe Analytics at a fraction of cost. The cost would be mainly ChatGPT plus subscription.\n\nSo let me know the precise problems you are facing with Google Analytics 4 which you did not have with Universal Analytics.\n\nEdit: I have decided against writing a comprehensive guide for big query and GA4 integration myself after discussing it with a lot of existing GA4 users. Most GA4 users I came across are non technical who don't want to fiddle around in Big Query. They want a better UI instead for querying data. \n\nUsing GPT for querying data has also two fundamental problems I didn't consider earlier for non technical users. \n\nBig Query offers two pricing models, on demand pricing and capacity based pricing. With Capacity based pricing, you pay a fixed amount for \"always on\"  resources, so while it offers predictable pricing, it is only useful if a team of analysts is constantly querying big query. I don't think even 1% of GA4 users fall into category. So, most GA4 users will opt for in demand pricing. With on demand pricing, you sort of pay per query instead of a fixed price and Google will automatically scale the compute to analyze your data. The downsize is that, if you are not careful, it's very easy to write a query which is inefficient and end up costing you hundreds of dollars. This is especially a bigger problem if you use an LLM like ChatGPT to create SQL queries and you don't know SQL or understand the pricing model. \n\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that you actually need to be proficient with SQL to validate the queries LLM's like ChatGPT generate, otherwise you will end up reporting flat out wrong numbers which is worse than having no numbers. \n\n\nThe first problem can technically be solved by showing the predicted cost of each query and taking user consent before running but embedding it into the custom GPT will take more time then I can spend on a hobby project. The second problem, I believe is unsolvable due to the nature of LLMs. \n\n\nSo, unfortunately I think such a guide/GPT would only be useful for a minority of users who are already proficient with SQL but then this segment of users would already know about GA4's integration with big query so a guide would not really help them. \n\n\nIf you are in the minority of users who understand SQL and use GA4, you can just search YouTube and Google for various guides on GA4's integration with Big Query. This is Google's own documentation.\n\n \nHow to setup data export from GA4 to big query. \n\nhttps://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9358801?hl=en\n\nThe database schema\n\nhttps://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7029846?hl=en\n\nWhy some numbers might be different between UI and Big Query?\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/analytics/blog/2023/bigquery-vs-ui\n\nThanks",

They're marketed as being the same yet don't allow the same amount of integrations (Google Ad Manager links, Salesforce links, etc. not available in subs) which causes headaches when departments want to try to split themselves into sub-properties. They have weird limits in what they can do. At that point, what's the point in having sub-property Audiences if they don't roll up to the parent or other integrations? Stuff like that.\n\nI've also discovered very sneaky bugs and nuances during the migration. Like having duplicate pageviews when trying to do anything using Google Tag Manager because the Enhanced Measurement Protocol is A) Automatically set to ON in a property (what?) and B) Pageviews were set to fire on history changes -\\_\\_\\_\\_- That one took a while to realize\n\nAll those issues and more compounded by the fact that there's not a whole lot of clear documentation of all these different nuances in a readable format. The existing documents reference other documents and it can be a mess to troubleshoot something simple. Google might also have a hidden business reason why they set certain things on and may be making it hard to switch them off or do custom configurations.

Since February our traffic as reported by Google Analytics has dropped by half and has remained consistently at this lower pattern since. Despite this, our engagement time is up by 54% though from 48 to 88 seconds. A couple thoughts are floating around the office to what could be causing this drop.\n\nWe launched an app around this time that essentially pulls new posts on the site to the app.\n\n* The number of total users for this app is lower than the number of users missing by the sum of 20k so the traffic hasn't transferred.\n* One thought is that we may be being dinged by Google for having a \"duplicative content\" because the app technically is another site, although it shouldn't be crawlable in the same way our site is (although we know they still do)\n\nWe removed marketing/ad pixels from the site at some point recently (confirming the timeline) that may have been inflating our previous data, this could explain the drop in acquisition, but the increase in engagement.\n\nWe have been experiencing DDoS attacks this season because we are a US based org can be perceived as progressive, although we are a bipartisan.\n\n* I have a hunch traffic is being suppressed perhaps related to this? Although it seems like traffic is down across the board, even from our email campaigns and other eternal avenues that are not related to search engines.\n\nAny thoughts y'all may have would be greatly appreciated.",

It operates without consent since its tracking logic works on an entirely different level. I really recommend it.\n\nYou won‚Äôt get event tracking, that‚Äôs true, but you can monitor visits by page, device, source, and various other metrics.

Hit F12 on your keyboard\n2. Click the \"Console\" tab\n3. Copy and paste this code snippet\n4. Press Enter to run it\n\n```javascript\n(() => {\n  // Check consent mode and GDPR blocking patterns\n  const checks = {\n    gtm_loaded: !!window.google_tag_manager,\n    dataLayer_exists: typeof dataLayer !== 'undefined',\n    consent_mode_active: typeof dataLayer !== 'undefined' ?\n      dataLayer.some(e => e.event && e.event.includes('consent')) : false,\n    ga4_requests: performance.getEntriesByType('resource')\n      .filter(e => e.name.includes('/g/collect')).length,\n    gdpr_signals: document.querySelector('[class*=\"gdpr\"], [class*=\"consent\"], [class*=\"cookie\"]') ? 'Found' : 'None'\n  };\n\n  console.log('üîç EU Traffic + Consent Mode Diagnostic:');\n  console.table(checks);\n\n  // Check for consent state\n  if (typeof dataLayer !== 'undefined') {\n    const consentEvents = dataLayer.filter(e =>\n      e.event && (e.event.includes('consent') || e.event.includes('gdpr'))\n    );\n    console.log('Consent events found:', consentEvents);\n\n    // Check current consent state\n    if (window.gtag) {\n      console.log('Current consent state - check gtag consent defaults');\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    diagnosis: checks.consent_mode_active ?\n      'Consent mode detected - check EU consent defaults' :\n      'No consent mode - GDPR may be blocking all EU traffic',\n    action: 'Check if consent_mode is configured for European visitors'\n  };\n})();\n```\n\nThis will show you if consent mode is configured and identify what's blocking your European traffic.\n\nThe \"EU traffic missing + partial conversions\" pattern indicates:\n1. **Consent mode misconfiguration** - EU visitors blocked entirely instead of cookieless tracking\n2. **GDPR banner setup** - Banner blocking analytics completely for EU users\n3. **Default consent state** - Not configured for denied‚Üígranted consent flow\n4. **Geographic consent logic** - Different consent behavior for EU vs non-EU visitors\n\nSince Europe is your target market, losing this data completely undermines your ability to understand and optimize for your core audience.\n\nAre you seeing any consent-related events in your dataLayer, or does your GDPR banner completely block tracking for European visitors?",

About a 1/3 of users opt out so I was expecting lower new user figures. But the organic search new users has practicaly zero'd out! Halfway through December 2024 was when the new opt in/opt out was put on the site.\n\nDec-24\t7716\t1763\n\nJan-25\t8334\t124\n\nFeb-25\t6942\t121\n\nAnyone have any clues why organic has vanished? It looks to me like they are in the Direct count for some reason. If my assumption is right that anyone opting out of cookies wont appear in these figures, and I know about a 1/3 are opting out, then adjusting the Dec, Jan and Feb figures would suggest a similar number of users to the other months. Which is why I am thinking that organic data is being included in direct data.\n\nThanks for any hints, tips and thoughts :)  \n\n",

The front end matches this count when I do it in BQ.\n\nI made a custom sessionID as a test via GTM and found my custom one aligns with the ga ones where it exists, but my custom one is pulling alot more.\n\nA third party marketing firm and a legacy tool (which I found out about today) both give numbers closer to my custom sessionID quantity. \n\nThe questions are:\n1 - From the above, does it seem GA is under reporting sessions? Is that how the front end works?\n2 - What's gone wrong? GTM is sending data (proved by custom sessionID), it's getting into BQ and GA, and Google are making IDs some of the time. It seems extream if 94% are blocking tracking? I can't fathom where the missing link is.\n\nThanks for any help or advice in advance!",

I noticed that despite having entire departments dedicated to analytics and tracking it was still difficult to get it right. I figured if big companies have these issues they also apply to smaller ones.\n\nThats why i have started a little side project aiming to make analytics simpler for smaller companies. The idea is to build a service that allows you to create links and track stats for each individual link. That includes:\n\n* what product pages are visited after landing on the link destination\n* conversion rate, add to cart rate, purchase rate for the various pages the customer visits after clicking the link\n\nThe plan is to build it on top of GA4 so you wont have to integrate with yet another service. So my question for you guys is, do you think a tool like this would be usefull?\n\n\n\nIf yes, i am currently looking for a few people to interview about their tracking needs and later someone who would be interested in joining as beta testers for the solution. Please also dont be shy to leave a comment if you hate the idea aswell, all feedback is much appreciated!",

Ensure that you‚Äôve exactly matched the event category, action, and label names in GA4 with what you‚Äôve set up in GTM. Another thing to check is that you've properly linked your GTM and GA4 accounts, and there are no tagging conflicts or filters that might be blocking the data. Also, it can sometimes take a bit of time for new events to start showing up in GA4, so give it a day and check back.  \n  \nIf you're still having issues, dive into your troubleshooting by using the Google Analytics Debugger Chrome extension to see exactly what‚Äôs being sent to GA4 when those custom events are fired. By comparing the console logs with what you expect, you might uncover any discrepancies. Remember to also verify that you‚Äôve published your changes in GTM. Sometimes the simplest things can trip us up.  \n  \nBy the way, I'm Dhruv from StatsPro, where I've seen a smoother setup and real-time event tracking help avoid these hassles. It's a privacy-friendly alternative to GA that might cut down on some of these tracking headaches. Hope this helps. Good luck",

Is started with just few hundred sessions each day but now we are at roughly 10000 sessions a day which messes up our stats quite a bit. \n\nMost of this traffic ignores our cookie consent popup, which is why we see only a very small percentage in GA4. But we have another web analytics tool which allows privacy-compliant tracking of all traffic and there we see all this traffic.\n\nThe traffic all goes to the homepage and the bounce rate is around 98%, which would normally indicate bot traffic. But apart from the bounce rate the traffic looks fairly normal - the IP-addresses vary a lot (retrieved from our server logs) and the distribution of user agents, screen sizes or browser language settings is roughly the same as for our other users.\n\nI could simply exclude this referrer from our reporting, but I am wondering whether it might be some misconfigured adserver or similar which might also be used for legit purposes. Therefore I thought I would check here first.\n\nDoes one of you maybe know where this traffic comes from or has seen this referrer in their own data?\n\nThanks\n\nClaudia",

Depending on user consent status, if a GCLID is present and if UTM parameters are present, we have improved our logic that sets source and medium values. We now more frequently set source/medium dimensions to \"google / cpc\", and default channel groups to Paid Search where appropriate based on these signals.\n\nNote how this message talks about \"Default Channel Group\", not \"Session Default Channel Group\".

It can also fluctuate depending on timing and spend of ads (ads on, direct % lower, ads off, direct % higher). \n\nHere's a specific example. eCommerce website that runs paid ads at specific times throughout the year, direct traffic drops to below 10% of total traffic.

Has anyone else experienced this with their cookie consent platform, or knows if this could be behind the large drop in traffic we're seeing?\n\nWe're also finding that our Google Ad clicks are much higher than sessions (from Google CPC) on GA4. I know that these are measured in different ways, but the difference is quite large. We've done some further research online and read a bunch of articles, and can confirm:\n\n* our tag is implemented correctly\n* our website loads at a decent speed, so shouldn't be a slow load issue - for most anyway\n* there are no redirects on the PPC landing pages\n* our Google Ads and GA4 accounts are linked\n\nWe send reporting out via Looker Studio - we're seeing the discrepancies between G Ads and GA4 and are finding it hard to explain why and also how to 'fix' it or have solutions in place.\n\nAs I've said, any help is much appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance for any replies.",

Here‚Äôs what might be happening:\n\n1. **Multiple Containers/Implementations**: If you have more than one Google Tag Manager container or multiple instances of Google Analytics code installed (e.g., a hardcoded GA snippet and a GTM implementation), this can lead to the creation of multiple `_ga_*` cookies. You'd want to check if there are duplicate GA setups.\n2. **Different Properties**: GA4 can generate different `_ga_*` cookies if you are tracking multiple properties (e.g., a universal analytics property and a GA4 property). Each property would have its own set of cookies but they shouldn‚Äôt interfere with each other in terms of data collection.\n3. **Cookie Consents**: If your site has cookie consent management in place (such as Google Consent Mode), it may handle cookies differently based on user consent, but this shouldn't duplicate data either.\n\nTo solve this:\n\n* **Check the source of both cookies**: Use your browser's developer tools to inspect what is setting each cookie (they might have different origins).\n* **Remove or combine duplicate setups**: If there are multiple GA installations, decide which one to keep and remove the redundant implementation.\n* **Ensure clean GTM setup**: Double-check that only one set of tags is firing for GA4.\n\nIf there's no visible issue in your testing, and the visitor count isn't inflated, this might not be a serious problem, but cleaning up duplicate cookies is good practice for performance and clarity.",

I've also done *some* Adobe Launch\n- I run consent management projects end-to-end (advanced knowledge of Didomi, OneTrust, Consent Mode.

I want to gain some **meaningful** credentials. Can you guys suggest some professional or expert-level certifications or degrees I could start working towards ?\n\nI just spent a shit ton of my education budget which was gonna expire/renew at the end of last month. I've purchased my CIPP exam (Certified Information Privacy Professional) and I also snagged the CIPT education material. I also purchased the GCP Associate Cloud Engineer certification (at one point I held a triple foundation-level certification - AWS CCP + GCP CDL + Azure AZ-900). I'm not fully convinced I want to get more actual data analysis credentials.. I'm moreso interested in privacy management as well as business analysis. I'm probably eligible for the CCBA exam from the IIBA (the associate-level certification in business analysis). I've also considered accelerating through a WGU bachelors degree so i can enter a masters program at my local business school. I got 2000$ fresh dollars to spend in my training budget @ work.\n\nI feel like I'm all over the place. Please help. I know I'm asking for a lot, but I truly appreciate y'alls input.",

When implementing the advanced approach you will see more data in GA4 because Google will do a kind of statistical projection.\n\n  \nWhatever you decide to do to get more data, please make sure to stay compliant.

One thing to flag on the Shopify front, I've found for a few of my clients that Shopify sites have a script that we can't remove that uses a gtag function to set consent states. If you load the site in preview mode and see a lot of events on the left hand side called \"Consent\" you may have the same script.\n\nIf the script is setting the consent flags to denied, it's possible your tags are sending unconsented pings to GA4, which probably won't appear in your dataset. Unconsented pings do eventually appear in the data, but modelling needs to kick in, which can take weeks\n\nI appreciate that was quite technical, not sure how familiar you are with the space.

Basically, when a user doesn't consent, the tag still fires but it sends the data as an unconsented ping. GA4 knows a page_view (or any other event) has happened, but it's not tied to a specific user. Then, after a couple of weeks, GA4 begins to model the unconsented pings and fills in the gaps in the data.\n\nFor example, it can look at your consented data and see 20 users and 100 page views. If the unconsented pings report 200 page_views, it'll estimate there were 40 users among the unconsented traffic and add that to reports. That's a massive oversimplification, but it's generally how it works. Modelling consented data with Advanced Consent Mode is the best way to stay GDPR compliant, and to stay on Google's good side.",

Unfortunately I don't have access to the account so I can't just dig into dimensions to sort it out like I normally would.  Here's what I do know:  \n  \n- The setup is a fairly standard e-commerce setup in GA4 via GTM  \n- In early March, attribution for one paid traffic source changed sharply, both revenue and conversion numbers.  The advertiser has a conversion point and confirmed that performance hasn't changed, but we saw a big change in GA4 totals.  \n- The website owner claims nothing was changed in the account or implementation, and nothing was changed on the advertiser side  \n- When I asked the site to pull last month by date and by campaign, I see a different conversion total but same revenue number.  This one has me a bit stumped.  Example is:  by date I see 35 conversions for $916 and by campaign I see 29 conversions for $916.\n\nBased on this alone, can I point to anything specific?  I'm leaning towards there being a change in consent, or a big swing in traffic that affected the GA modeling... but curious if others have ideas based on this?  Thanks!  \n",

There were consent changes in March so that is a common reason and I'd still check how their consent settings are configured to be sure that isn't it.\n\nThat being said, check the campaign names - is there a specific campaign that is consistently off, or is it something across the board? If it's off on all campaigns, I'd say it's some sort of configuration issue. If this is Google Ads, check the link and see if there is a tagging template or something else that could be throwing things off.\n\nSorry I don't have more solutions, this is a weird one for sure!

Do some tests where you accept cookies and check Chrome dev tools console and go to network tab and search for \"Collect\" and if there are network responses click on them to check they are GA's and if so also check the gcs= param to ensure its value = G111 (if its G100 it means you are sending 'denied' cookie consent for ad and analytics storage and would mean you have an issue) if you clicked accept all cookies (this is consent mode signal) and therefore this would indicate you are ok and if not then shows their is an issue with your config",

Some days it's over 50% of overall traffic. Previously it was 1-5%.\n\nAny ideas on the cause?\n\n  \nFor those who want more detail:\n\nThe increase seems to be coming from a combination of other channels ranging from Paid Search to Organic Social, as those channels represent less traffic than they used to. We haven't confirmed but it may also be from Direct.\n\nIn March we determined that Consent Mode was enabled without our knowledge, resulting in near total data loss for two weeks. We then experimented with Consent Mode and added a cookie banner. Around this time we first noticed the boost to Unassigned traffic so we deactivated Consent Mode and removed the cookie banner. \n\nWe thought this would help but Unassigned remains significant. ",

Using a customer data platform that allows for segmentation or scrubbing a certain data has to occur before you can send information to Google analytics, Google ads, etc. There are very few platforms that currently specialize in healthcare and simplify this process. I was hoping that Google might offer some way to manage this. As Google will not sign a business associate agreement, which allows you to send certain data points, you end up having to pay money to use their free tools.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion within the healthcare community as the rules have changed regarding HIPAA. So, for instance, in Washington state perusing a page as a user that contains healthcare information and sending an IP address to ga is considered identifying information and is now illegal. So there is HIPAA, which already states there are 18 identifying factors which are now violations and an ever increasing privacy situation. Look up Washington state my health, my data.",

        "author": "RoastPotatoSandwich",
        "id": "19d9fxc",
        "selftext": "My client runs a website that functions as a directory of marketing experts. On this website, each marketing expert has a dedicated page where the URL and the page title include the name of the expert.\n\nNow, here's the twist: The PII involved is not about the users of the site, but rather about the marketing experts listed in the directory. These experts have consented to have their names displayed in this way. However, I'm curious about the implications this might have in terms of Google Analytics 4 (GA4) regulations, specifically regarding PII.\n\nThe marketing expert can log into their page and update their data and we are collecting User ID. So in theory I can connect the name and the User ID to identift this user.\n\nFrom my understanding, GA4 has strict policies against the collection and storage of PII, which generally includes data that can identify, contact, or locate a person. In our case, the names of these experts in URLs or page titles could be considered PII. However, since this information is not about the site's visitors but about the listed individuals who have given their consent, I'm unsure if this still poses an issue under GA4's PII policies.\n\nMy considerations are as follows:\n\n* PII of Listed Individuals: The inclusion of the experts' names might be a concern for their privacy, but they have consented to this usage.\n* Analytics Data: GA4 focuses on user data. Since we‚Äôre not collecting personal data about the visitors, it seems like it might not be an issue from this angle.\n* Consent and Disclosure: The experts have agreed to have their names used in this manner, but does this fully mitigate potential issues with GA4?\n* Google Analytics Terms: I'm also contemplating whether this usage conflicts with Google Analytics‚Äô terms of service in any way.\n* I'm leaning towards the idea that while this might not be a direct GA4 user PII concern, it still warrants careful consideration, especially in terms of consent and legal compliance.\n\nI would appreciate any insights, or opinions on this matter. Do you think this setup violates GA4 PII regulations, or does the consent from the listed experts and the focus on their information (not the site users‚Äô) change the situation?",

How do we track website metrics like traffic, source/medium, and conversions without PII and still gain comprehensive insights? Looking for advice on tools, techniques, and best practices that ensure insightful, compliant analytics without data loss from non-consent sessions. Eager to hear your experiences and solutions.**\n\nHello, Reddit marketing and privacy enthusiasts!\n\nI'm tackling the complex intersection of GDPR compliance and effective data analytics for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly those with less than 1000 daily visitors on their websites. The crux of the matter is how to responsibly track user behavior and campaign success without breaching privacy regulations or relying heavily on personally identifiable information (PII).\n\nThe challenge intensifies with the GDPR imposing strict guidelines on data collection, leaving us questioning the extent to which we can monitor website metrics like traffic sources, engagement, and conversions in a privacy-respecting manner. This has become especially pertinent in light of recent clampdowns on cookie usage and the requirement for explicit user consent, which has undeniably impacted our ability to collect comprehensive analytics.\n\n**Here are the pressing questions:**\n\n‚Ä¢\tHow do you navigate GDPR restrictions to gather useful website metrics without overstepping privacy boundaries, especially in the context of SMEs?\n\n‚Ä¢\tHave you found innovative or privacy-friendly tools and techniques that provide valuable insights without infringing on user privacy?\n\n‚Ä¢\tFor those managing websites with fewer than 1000 daily visitors, how do you ensure your data analytics practices are both insightful and compliant (without compromising on loss of data)?\n\n‚Ä¢\tI'm keen to hear if others are experiencing similar challenges with GDPR compliance and how it's affecting your ability to conduct thorough analyses for clients.\n\nI'm looking for shared experiences, advice, or any insights on balancing the need for data-driven marketing with the imperative of privacy compliance. How far can we really go in tracking and analyzing our website traffic within the bounds of the GDPR, and what best practices should we adopt to safeguard our efforts against potential pitfalls?\n\n*Appreciate your input and looking forward to learning from this community!*",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nMaybe a niche issue, but one of our sites is seeing a change in traffic attribution since 21st March 2024 so all of it is reporting as none and not-set. Initial thoughts were\n\n* Was it linked to the consent mode v2 changes on the 6th March?\n* Was there some change in the site causing sessions to get restarted?\n\nThe strange things is this - when changing to \"device-based\" reporting identity all of the traffic looks normal, but both blended and observed show the attribution changes. We didn't think that consent mode should have had an impact on this, and the fact that \"observed\" showed the change as well made us wonder if something was happening regarding user\\_id tracking, but no changes that we know of have happened in this regard \n\nMore info\n\n* The site is split into 2 sub-domains for the brochure side and booking side (not cross-domain).\n* Overall sessions haven't increased or decreased.\n* Same GTM and GA4 being used across both sub-domains\n* Overall traffic hasn't been lost, just the attribution has changed\n* When changing to \"device-based\" reporting identity, the attribution goes back to looking as it did previously\n* When comparing a previous time period before 21st March, all 3 reporting identities report the same values.\n* The change doesn't look gradual over time, just an immediate switch from one attribution to the other\n* We can't identify any coding or config changes within the website that might have caused this to happen (but doesn't that wasn't something that we might have missed or overlooked)\n* There is no consent mode setting happening apart from the enforced v2 changes i.e. I can see a gcd parameter in the GA4 traffic, but no gcs parameter\n   * There isn't a cookie management platform in place (there should be, but here we are, something we are suggesting should happen regardless of this issue)\n* There isn't any remarketing activity happening, mostly SEO and organic.\n* The attribution change is almost entirely in the booking sub-domain\n* There is some attribution change on the homepage (more traffic obviously than other pages) from the same period, but it's insignificant in comparison (not dismissing this info, just don't know how to use it)\n* There hasn't been a change in landing pages potentially showing that the sessions are continuing as they were\n\nWe are a bit of a loss as to what is going on, and whether it could be linked to consent mode. It feels there is an answer given all of the bits of info, but we can't figure it out.\n\nAny insights would be very much appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \nJarrod",

I'm having daily increments of 100 users (on some days 0) while in GA4 the audiences are rising by 50k a day. My conset setup is good - GA4 config tag is firing only after consent is granted. \n\nI've tried everything in my might but can't seem to find a solution. Google's documentation on the subject is sparse at best. \n\nAlso I've observed that the collect cookies we generate don't have t=ga-audience in the payload even when GADs remarketing tags fire. Is this the case? T=dc calls are going out and display audiences are populating faster all beit very slowly in comparison. \n\nAny one else encountered this problem. ",

        "selftext": "\r  \n\r  \nGoogle Analytics 4 (GA4) is the latest version of Google's web analytics platform, designed to provide more advanced insights into user behavior across multiple platforms and devices. The working process of Google Analytics 4 involves several key steps:\r  \n‚≠ê Data Collection: GA4 collects data from various sources, including websites, mobile apps, and other digital platforms. It uses a combination of JavaScript tracking code for websites and SDKs (Software Development Kits) for mobile apps to gather data.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Event Tracking: GA4 focuses heavily on event-based tracking rather than pageviews. Events represent user interactions with content on your site or app, such as button clicks, form submissions, video views, and purchases. Events are customizable and allow for detailed tracking of user behavior.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Data Processing: Once data is collected, GA4 processes it in real-time to generate reports and insights. This processing includes aggregating and analyzing event data to provide meaningful metrics and dimensions.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Machine Learning: GA4 incorporates machine learning capabilities to provide more advanced insights and predictions. This includes features such as predictive analytics, which can forecast future user behavior based on historical data patterns.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Reporting: GA4 offers a range of reports and dashboards to visualize data and metrics. These reports cover various aspects of user engagement, acquisition, behavior, and conversions. Users can customize reports and set up alerts to monitor key metrics.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Audience Segmentation: GA4 allows users to create custom audiences based on specific criteria, such as demographics, interests, and user behavior. This segmentation enables targeted marketing campaigns and personalized experiences.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Integration with Google Marketing Platform: GA4 seamlessly integrates with other Google Marketing Platform products, such as Google Ads and Google Tag Manager. This integration allows for better tracking and optimization of marketing campaigns across multiple channels.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Privacy and Compliance: GA4 prioritizes user privacy and compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA. It provides features for data retention controls, user consent management, and data deletion requests.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, the working process of Google Analytics 4 involves collecting, processing, and analyzing data from various sources to provide insights into user behavior and performance metrics, ultimately helping businesses make data-driven decisions and optimize their digital marketing strategies.\r  \n\r  \nüëâüèº If you have more queries, feel free to ask me anytime üëàüèº",

Is there a consent or analytics management tool that checks the geo location of a visitor and based on the rules of the country shows consent-banner or collects personal user info such as IP address? That would probably increase data quality because we only need consent from EU citizen right?",

Without cookies and Att look a like audiences already are pretty bad and will get worse.\n\nWe are going to need to better understand our target audiences and figure out where they are. And revert to old fashioned marketing, the right message, to the right person, at the right time. Much more audience research will be needed.",

So, you can't use these hits to do behavioral analysis, but you can at least get total counts of pageviews and conversions for unconsented users. \n\nDo note, that if someone is a using an anaylics blocker that prevents the JS from running, you still won't get those clicks. \n\nHere's a bit from google on non-consented user info collection: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9358801?hl=en",
