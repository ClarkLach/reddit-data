I've connected Google Analytics to Google Ads and things were going fine, until I was hit with the issue of \"missing consent signals\", as we are doing ads in Europe as well.\n\n  \nI think what is required of me is to have a popup for visitors saying \"do you allow cookies etc.\" and Google is kind enough to automate this process by suggesting a bunch of providers.\n\n  \nThe following just occured to me... I'm using a lot of different apps through my browser, and it has been a very long time since I've encountered a cookie popup. I visited these websites again through a European VPN + Incognito and I still don't see them. Do they not bother with it at all? Or are they handling this in some other way?\n\n  \nAlso, does this prevent the ads etc in any way? Or does it just block me from viewing the analytics from those particular users?\n\n  \nI'm fine with a cookies popup and all, but it occured to me that many apps similar to ours (to give a few examples: Lovable, n8n, Zapier...) are not doing this at all. Does this mean they are not seeing their analytics as well? Or rather that they are not using Google Ads / Analytics, which enforces this?\n\n  \nI'm a newbie in this field and I would appreciate any pointers. thanks!",

To say more would me you have to tell more about where you are, and how your CMP, GTM, and GA is configured.",

You don't need to use consent mode necessarily to handle statelevel laws but Google have made it super easy with a 'region' parameter in the consent mode call!\n\nIdeally you should have a multi region cookie consent with consent mode setup that does the following:\n- show cookiebanner to only visitors that need to see one\n- when you need to show the cookie banner and cookie policy page make sure its the right one to the right user based on their region (I.e. if they come from eu show gdpr style banner and cookie policy and if from California show them ccpa style etc.)\n- make sure your tracking is setup to respect these user cookie consent choices (if they are presented by these cookie banners) based on the type of cookie consent law.

        "selftext": "We‚Äôve been experiencing tracking discrepancies in GA4 ever since implementing Consent Mode. Our GA4 performance has dropped significantly, and we suspect it's due to consent-related issues.  \nWe‚Äôve tested both CookieBot and CookieYes, and both report around a 30% consent rejection rate. However, GA4 isn‚Äôt reflecting that data properly‚Äîinstead, we‚Äôre seeing a much lower user count than expected.\n\n  \nOur Setup:\n\n* **Cross-domain tracking in GA4** (each domain has its own GTM). \n* **Main issue is with our primary website** (our booking partner‚Äôs data seems fine). \n* **Currently using CookieBot.** \n* **Cross-domain settings** are configured in GA4 and within the conversion linkers in GTM. \n* **CookieBot is implemented via GTM** using the CookieBot CMP tag type, triggered by \"Consent Initialization - All Pages.\" \n* **GA4 tags & Conversion Linker tags** are triggered on \"All Pages.\" \n* We‚Äôve tested **custom event triggers (cookie\\_consent\\_update)** per CookieBot‚Äôs suggestion, but they advised using \"All Pages\" instead. \n* Followed **MeasureSchool‚Äôs setup tutorial** and configured consent settings in GTM, ensuring tags use built-in consent settings with no additional consent required. \n\nTroubleshooting So Far:\n\n* Added **GA4 tracking via an HTML tag** instead of the GA4 config tag. \n* Set **Conversion Linker to override cookie settings** with \\_gcl as the prefix and included the domain. \n* This helped *somewhat*, but we‚Äôre still seeing discrepancies. \n\nAt this point, we‚Äôre unsure what we‚Äôre missing. Are there additional Consent Mode settings we should check? Has anyone dealt with a similar issue and found a fix?  \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",

I've loyally upgraded everytime I've been requested, which is a task as the site is large, and has several systems within it.  I get the data I need now from Adsense, Search consule or Cloudflare with less hassle that GA4. \n\nAnyway, last week I logged into GA and was confronted with lots of orange warnings about EU consent for Analytics and Advertising. To the best of my knowledge I installed tag manager etc when updating to GA4. A Google consent pop-up appears asking for consent when visiting my site. I thought that was it .... apparently not. \n\nThese warnings have now appeared (Analytics cookie consent signals inactive), ( Ads cookie consent signals inactive , Ads measurement consent signals inactive, Ads personalization consent signals inactive\"\n\nI've followed their \"instructions\" as best I can for \"setting up consent mode\". Suffice to say, I'm lost.\n\nI've the Google consent showing up. Yet nowhere can I find the \"I have the google consent pop up showing\". It only shows me to set up 3rd party platforms ... Surely the Google pop up is not 3rd party? Anyway, I can't find Googles own \"I am using Google\" button or whatever to dismiss all this. \n\nI've tried test your consent signals. It sees the tag. The pop up, I click consent. The consent pop up closes. Then nothing. No changes on either tab. I've no idea.\n\nThere's no warning on Adsense, or search console. Just Analytics.\n\nCould anyone please tell me how to resolve this? Is it even worth doing?",

Are you using a Cookie Management Platform like CookieBot, CookieYes or did you make a custom solution?\n\nThe warnings you receive are from Google's new requirement (since March 2024) to send Consent states along with the hits from the tags. Google is now adhering to laws in Europe which have been in place since 2018.\n\nIt's actually fairly simple to setup if you already use Google Tag Manager for all your scripts. Basically if a new visitor lands on your website, you use Google Tag Manager to set default states for the different types of cookies/storages. I.e. ad_storage = denied etc.\n\nIf you fire a tag (from Google or Microsoft) it reads the default state and makes sure the tag respects that default state.\n\nNow. If your cookie popup shows and a visitor consents to a type of cookie. Typically a CMP template will send an update event like cookie_consent_update with the updated consents for i.e. ad_storage = granted. Tags from Google and Microsoft will automatically pick up on these consent changes for the different storages and will change their behaviour.\n\nIt's called Google Advanced Consent Mode v.2 and there are guides from Simo Ahova if you have a custom solution or use the step by step guides if you use CookieBot or something like that.",

But Consent Mode by itself doesn‚Äôt actually collect consent. It just reacts to it.\n\nAnd so that‚Äôs where a CMP comes in. It handles the heavy lifting of actually asking users for consent, tracking their choices, and making sure those choices are passed to tools like Google Tag Manager. Without a CMP, you‚Äôre kind of missing the ‚Äúfront end‚Äù of the process.\n\nSo while it‚Äôs technically possible to do basic consent tagging without a CMP, you‚Äôd be handling a lot manually, and it‚Äôs easy to miss things (especially when laws like GDPR or CPRA are involved).

Before that, I was pretty satisfied with the accuracy of our data, especially when comparing it to backend website sales.\n\nSince the switch, I‚Äôve noticed a significant drop in our Google Ads ROAS (which I expected), but what‚Äôs really concerning is the massive drop in reported conversion value in GA4. User stats seem to be consistent with what we had before, but the conversion values are way off compared to the actual orders on our website. I‚Äôm starting to suspect that the tracking might not have been set up correctly, and I‚Äôm looking to make things more accurate if possible.\n\nRegarding Advanced Mode, am I correct in thinking that even if a user declines or ignores cookie consent, a cookieless ping would still be sent to GA4 and Google Ads? And would general data like users, page visits, and conversion values still be tracked?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!\n\nNath",

I'm a little bit confused if it is since shouldn't consent mode only apply to EU data?  \n  \nAlso I know thresholding could prevent demographic data from showing up as well though I feel like that shouldn't be an issue as my page has had 750 views in the last 30 days.\n\nSo could someone let me know what I need to do to have demographic data show up? I'm ok to see everything except EU data for now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gf5t7j4qiod1.png?width=2218&format=png&auto=webp&s=dec0c1693e7a7d88b0822c0217ffc96fe92b01e7\n\nThanks!",

This is crucial if you're tracking conversions and creating audiences through GA4 since consent mode impacts both first-party and third-party data. If you're not set up with this, you might face issues like ad suspension. Even though you've got your floodlight tags covered, check that your GA4 is also aligned with these consent rules to avoid any disruptions.\n\n  \nSeems like there's a bit of confusion around certified consent mode services. It boils down to ensuring you're using a service that correctly gathers user consent while interacting with Google Ads. If your audience setup involves GA4 data, it's best to incorporate a consent mode that adheres to these guidelines, even if it‚Äôs not directly about third-party data. This keeps you fully compliant and in safe territory with Google Ads.\n\n  \nI'm Ben, and I work at StatsPro, which is a Google Analytics alternative.

We haven't launched OneTrust yet due to a number of factors but are about to. Or were, until we hit a ridiculous snag we didn't see coming.\n\nOur ecomm platform (Tessitura, a CRM/ticketing solution used by theaters & museums) recently made a change which breaks our purchase tracking in GA4. We can work around this by adding our GA ID into the back end of the Tessitura ecomm interface, so that our GA tags load via the GTM container that's embedded within its code, and suppressing our own GA4 tags in GTM on our ecomm subdomain. We have zero control over any of the resulting tags, but the data comes through.\n\nProblem is...if we do this, we can't load OneTrust on our ecomm subdomain, because it's setup to load via GTM. I'm not optimistic but I'm wondering if anyone knows: **if we load OneTrust and set resulting consent mode triggers in our GTM container, will our GA4 property still respect those triggers if the tags load through the other, embedded container and not through our own?**\n\nThanks in advance for any knowledge you can share.",

Is it possible that I might lose access to session data even if using anonymized IP addresses? If so, could you please explain why this is the case?\n\n  \nI appreciate any help. \n\nThanks!",

Because the way you wrote it implies that the initial pageview is sent once the user consents, but from what you describe in your analytics data this apparently is not the case.\n\nThe other commentor already offered a possible solution, simply reload the first page after the user consents. Another way would be to make sure the analytics is sent through ga.send() (or other javascript, depending on your implementation). This way your visitors don‚Äôt have to wait for the page to reload after they consent.\n\nEither way, you just need to make sure the first pageview is sent somehow so GA can receive the referrer and campaign info.",

I‚Äôve seen big differences depending on whether the tracking code is dropped directly in theme files, added via Site Kit, or routed through plugins like MonsterInsights. Each approach can affect whether the tag fires consistently, double-fires, or misses sessions altogether.\n\nClicks vs. sessions rarely match perfectly (ad platforms count every click, GA filters out bot traffic, can be blocked when users have an ad-blocker active, etc.), but if you‚Äôre seeing wide gaps, it‚Äôs usually a sign that the GA tag isn‚Äôt firing on all pages or isn‚Äôt firing early enough.  \n  \nCommon things to check:\n\n* Make sure GA4 is in the `<head>` (not footer) so it fires before users bounce.\n* Verify only one instance of the GA tag is firing (GA4 Debug / Tag Assistant / GTM Preview can help).\n* Check consent settings or caching plugins that might delay/strip scripts.\n\nHow are you currently adding GA into your WP site? That‚Äôll help narrow down where accuracy could be improved - and I'd be happy to provide additional thoughts here in the thread; GA4 + Wodpress are where I spend the majority of my time.",

Im using GA4-DBT package, but I have come across problem and that is my metrics have huge differences in BQ vs GA4\n\n  \nfor example main ones ->   \nSessions (GA4 vs BigQuery)\n\n* `session_start` **events (BQ export):** **2,395,239**\n* **Starts missing both IDs (**`user_pseudo_id` **&** `ga_session_id`**):** **684,940**\n* **Observed sessions (BQ exact; distinct** `user_pseudo_id+ga_session_id`**):** **1,332,976**\n* **Sessions from** `session_start` **only (HLL p=12, UI-style):** **1,330,756**\n* **GA4 UI ‚Äì Sessions:** **2,652,091**\n\nAs you can see there is big difference in sessions, I tried even using HLL UI like approximation but still same, weird thing is that session starts are close to UI number.\n\n* **Purchase events in BQ (raw):** **22,841**\n* **Distinct** `transaction_id`**:** **22,837** (only **4** duplicates; **0** missing `transaction_id`)\n* **Purchase events missing both IDs (**`user_pseudo_id` **&** `ga_session_id`**):** **4,477** ‚Üí **19.60%**\n* **Items present:** **100%** of purchase events have `items[]`\n* **GA4 UI ‚Äì ‚ÄúEcommerce purchases‚Äù:** **31,575**\n\nHeres purchase event, now i thought events would be atleast somehow close, But theres difference around 9k purchases and that could mean a big difference in reports.\n\nIs GA4 modeling somehow in this? But the percentage seems really high especially for sessions for example? Or maybe 20 percent of purchases, i can maybe see there consent difference?\n\nAny tips what should I check? Maybe on website also? Help would be really appreciated! ",

It does not automatically apply the same filtering or estimation algorithms as the GA4 UI. This means you are responsible for defining and calculating sessions based on the raw event data.\n\n\nSession Definition and Calculation:\n\n\nGA4 UI: GA4 defines a session based on a session_start event or the first event in a new session, along with criteria like 30 minutes of inactivity to end a session.\n\n\nBigQuery: While the ga_session_id is available in BigQuery, directly counting unique ga_session_id values may not perfectly align with the GA4 UI's session count. This is because the GA4 UI's session logic can account for scenarios like multiple users having the same ga_session_id if their sessions started at the exact same timestamp, or inferring a new session even without an explicit session_start event if no active session exists for a given event",

If you use client side tracking you'll lose about 10 to 15% of transactions. \n\nAlso Meta uses a different attribution model, usually 7 day click, 1 day view so GA4 doesn't see the 1 day view as no clicks occurred on your site.

This scheduler is embedded on the websites of service provider organizations, and these organizations map their jobs through our admin panel. When jobs are booked through the scheduler, the data is sent to ServiceTitan.\n\n**What needs to be done:**\n\nCurrently, our scheduler is built in React.js. When a user completes a booking, we send a Google Analytics event using the Measurement Protocol from our backend (Node.js) to Google Analytics.\n\nThe issue is that I‚Äôm not sure how to mark these completed bookings as conversions in Google Ads. However, I do update my API data at that point.\n\nAs scheduler gets data from query prams so gclid is not a problem i can easily get it from parent website but I dont understand these Ads thing much.",

        "selftext": " Hi everyone,\nI‚Äôm working on GA4 cross-domain tracking using Google Tag Manager for a project involving multiple domains, one of them is in the EU and requires a cookie banner with Consent Mode v2, while the others (non-EU) do not use cookie banners at all.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far:\n\t‚Ä¢\tSet up cross-domain tracking in GA4 \n\t‚Ä¢\tAll domains use the same GA4 property\n\t‚Ä¢\tTags are deployed through GTM\n\nThe issue:\nWhen a user moves from one domain to another, the _gl parameter doesn‚Äôt show up in the URL, and GA4 reports these as referrals,so cross-domain session continuity is clearly broken.\n\nQuestions:\n\t1.\tCould Consent Mode on the EU domain be preventing the GA4 tag from injecting the _gl parameter before consent is given?\n\t2.\tCould the inconsistency (some domains with consent, some without) be causing the tracking issue?\n\t3.\tIs there a known workaround or standard setup when mixing Consent Mode + GTM + multiple domains?\n\nAny help or experience on this would mean a lot. thank you!",

The traffic acquisition report only shows about less than 20% of Google Ads traffic compared to what I see in the Google Ads interface.\n\nIs this the effect of browsers actively blocking cookies? I have done all the checks I could think of:\n\n\\- Auto tagging is enabled  \n\\- Google Consent Mode is implemented  \n\\- GCLID seems fine  \n\\- Google Ads and GA4 are properly linked  \n\\- Tags are firing\n\nI do think that maybe our cookie consent banner is too invisble, (it pops up in the bottom of the screen in the same background colour as the page) I think it's often ignored.\n\nI can't confirm this as I dont have access (yet) to the data of this consent banner.  \nIt's also not just Google Ads I also seem to miss quite a bit of LinkedIn traffic aswell.  \n  \nI have been out of the Digital Marketing game for a while so maybe I missed something but do more people struggle with huge chunks of missing data in GA4?\n\nAny tips are most welcome!\n\nThanks!",

Do the 'gcs' & the 'gcd' actually reflect the proper consent state for both the On Page Default state (Banner in the window OR declined) and the On Page Update (Banner (partially) accepted).  \n  \n\\- For the functionality of Consent Mode you can add the 7 states (ad\\_storage, analytics\\_storage, functionality\\_storage, personalization\\_storage, security\\_storage, ad\\_user\\_data, ad\\_personalization) into the Google Tag for GA4 (in GTM) as 'Shared event settings', these will also reflect in the request header in the developer tools (Network tab > search: 'collect' > payload tab).  \n  \n\\- Why would I focus first on CoMo? This is because when the 'gcs' and the 'gcd' reflect propper states, the advanced implementation with the machine learning can/will be activated.  \n  \nThat means even though the banner might have a high bounce rate, you still should be able to have more than 20% of your actual data.\n\nBut you stated you have been out of the game for a while and a lot is changing, no jokes. The largest changes for now are as you suggested:  \n\\- cookie- and/or ad-blockers;  \n\\- secondly; also the depreciation of 3rd party cookie by most browsers.\n\nTracking has become substantially more difficult, where I force all my clients to work with CookieBot (far from perfect and absolutely too expensive) for a smooth Consent Mode implementation;\n\nImplement all tags via Google Tag Manager (from Google Ads, to LinkedIn, to Facebook, Hotjar...you name it), so that there is controle on Consent Mode.\n\nImplement Enhanced Conversions for all LeadGen en Ecom conversions (e.g. purchase).\n\nAnd nowadays it becomes almost vital to implement 1st Party mode via Server Side tagging.\n\nBut all this is still far from perfect, where I have a client that is in the driver's-licence business and most of his clients are 18 year old. He gets really affected by browser restrictions and loses a big portion of his data.\n\nMomentarily there is not a base solution for this, where the obfuscation of measurement is high enough to not lose an extreme amount of data.\n\nSince I face this on a daily basis and my clients are panicking, I'm working on something that would fix this and many other problems for WordPress websites. Momentarily there is no one stop solution. I can let you know once it's done. Just sent me a DM.",

But in the end it's our job to make tracking possible anyhow and there are solutions for obfuscation.\n\nIt really depends on the websites current market how badly the current changes influence the tracking capabilities and therefore the optimization of ads accounts.\n\nThe really great thing of a proper functioning consent banner is the 'Advanced implementation', where machine learning (gcs = G100 OR G101, depending on the country), with AI can track the individuals that have declined the consent banner. In this process cookieless pings are compared to other customer journeys (that have accepted cookies), the AI will later stitch their data into functional conversions. Would not call this process watertight though.\n\nI hope you'll find your solutions!",

Forgive me if this question is a duplicate, and please direct me to a similar thread or discussion with the problem I will explain.\n\n\n\nI understand that the number of clicks in GSC and sessions in GA will never be the same because of the data collection method and others.\n\n\n\nCurrently, I see that the number of clicks on my website is higher than sessions. I assume that not all clicks will become sessions, because in my understanding, sessions are related to pageviews, so if clicks do not end in pageviews, then there are no sessions there, but clicks have occurred. Please help me correct my statement if I am wrong.\n\n\n\nHowever, I found that there are days when organic sessions are higher than clicks. I assume that organic sessions can occur from anywhere not just from Google search pages, while clicks in GSC only count clicks from Google Search pages. However, after I filtered only organic sessions that came from Google search pages, I found that the number of organic sessions was still much higher than clicks in GSC.\n\n\n\nAs an illustration, the difference between clicks and organic sessions that I observed on my website is around 10-15% with more clicks than sessions. While this one data point shows organic sessions are higher than clicks with a difference of approximately 24-25%.\n\n\n\nMy question is, what are the possibilities for this to happen? Then, if I have to do debugging, where should I start?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nSo, I had to dive into Google Analytics 4 for a project and I am really impressed with what you can do with it with its free Big Query integration but on all platforms, I keep hearing people aren't happy with Google Analytics 4 which is a bit surprising for me. Since, I have never worked with Universal Analytics so I can't make a direct comparison here, but I am dead sure whatever you could do with Universal Analytics, you could also do easily with Google Analytics 4 as well using Big Query and ChatGPT (if you are not proficient at SQL). \n\nMy goal is to put together a comprehensive guide and may be a free custom GPT in future (if time allows) which would enable anyone to dive into extremely detailed insights on their website and mobile apps, insights which were previously only possible with premium tools like Adobe Analytics at a fraction of cost. The cost would be mainly ChatGPT plus subscription.\n\nSo let me know the precise problems you are facing with Google Analytics 4 which you did not have with Universal Analytics.\n\nEdit: I have decided against writing a comprehensive guide for big query and GA4 integration myself after discussing it with a lot of existing GA4 users. Most GA4 users I came across are non technical who don't want to fiddle around in Big Query. They want a better UI instead for querying data. \n\nUsing GPT for querying data has also two fundamental problems I didn't consider earlier for non technical users. \n\nBig Query offers two pricing models, on demand pricing and capacity based pricing. With Capacity based pricing, you pay a fixed amount for \"always on\"  resources, so while it offers predictable pricing, it is only useful if a team of analysts is constantly querying big query. I don't think even 1% of GA4 users fall into category. So, most GA4 users will opt for in demand pricing. With on demand pricing, you sort of pay per query instead of a fixed price and Google will automatically scale the compute to analyze your data. The downsize is that, if you are not careful, it's very easy to write a query which is inefficient and end up costing you hundreds of dollars. This is especially a bigger problem if you use an LLM like ChatGPT to create SQL queries and you don't know SQL or understand the pricing model. \n\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that you actually need to be proficient with SQL to validate the queries LLM's like ChatGPT generate, otherwise you will end up reporting flat out wrong numbers which is worse than having no numbers. \n\n\nThe first problem can technically be solved by showing the predicted cost of each query and taking user consent before running but embedding it into the custom GPT will take more time then I can spend on a hobby project. The second problem, I believe is unsolvable due to the nature of LLMs. \n\n\nSo, unfortunately I think such a guide/GPT would only be useful for a minority of users who are already proficient with SQL but then this segment of users would already know about GA4's integration with big query so a guide would not really help them. \n\n\nIf you are in the minority of users who understand SQL and use GA4, you can just search YouTube and Google for various guides on GA4's integration with Big Query. This is Google's own documentation.\n\n \nHow to setup data export from GA4 to big query. \n\nhttps://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9358801?hl=en\n\nThe database schema\n\nhttps://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7029846?hl=en\n\nWhy some numbers might be different between UI and Big Query?\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/analytics/blog/2023/bigquery-vs-ui\n\nThanks",

They're marketed as being the same yet don't allow the same amount of integrations (Google Ad Manager links, Salesforce links, etc. not available in subs) which causes headaches when departments want to try to split themselves into sub-properties. They have weird limits in what they can do. At that point, what's the point in having sub-property Audiences if they don't roll up to the parent or other integrations? Stuff like that.\n\nI've also discovered very sneaky bugs and nuances during the migration. Like having duplicate pageviews when trying to do anything using Google Tag Manager because the Enhanced Measurement Protocol is A) Automatically set to ON in a property (what?) and B) Pageviews were set to fire on history changes -\\_\\_\\_\\_- That one took a while to realize\n\nAll those issues and more compounded by the fact that there's not a whole lot of clear documentation of all these different nuances in a readable format. The existing documents reference other documents and it can be a mess to troubleshoot something simple. Google might also have a hidden business reason why they set certain things on and may be making it hard to switch them off or do custom configurations.

Meta counts a landing page view as soon as the page starts loading, but GA4 only tracks users after the full page and scripts load. which often doesn‚Äôt happen on iPhones due to Safari blocking tracking, content blockers, or fast bounces. Since your site doesn't use Consent Mode or server-side tracking, GA4 is likely missing a lot of data. Implementing server-side tagging or Meta‚Äôs Conversion API can help reduce this gap.  \n  \nWhat You Can Do:\n\n\\-Check for script load errors on your landing page (especially on mobile Safari).  \n\\-Implement server-side tracking (via Meta‚Äôs Conversion API and/or GA4‚Äôs server-side tagging) to regain lost data.  \n\\-Consider Consent Mode for future-proofing, even if not required now.  \n\\-Set up custom UTM tracking to help reconcile traffic sources more reliably.",

A couple thoughts are floating around the office to what could be causing this drop.\n\nWe launched an app around this time that essentially pulls new posts on the site to the app.\n\n* The number of total users for this app is lower than the number of users missing by the sum of 20k so the traffic hasn't transferred.\n* One thought is that we may be being dinged by Google for having a \"duplicative content\" because the app technically is another site, although it shouldn't be crawlable in the same way our site is (although we know they still do)\n\nWe removed marketing/ad pixels from the site at some point recently (confirming the timeline) that may have been inflating our previous data, this could explain the drop in acquisition, but the increase in engagement.\n\nWe have been experiencing DDoS attacks this season because we are a US based org can be perceived as progressive, although we are a bipartisan.\n\n* I have a hunch traffic is being suppressed perhaps related to this? Although it seems like traffic is down across the board, even from our email campaigns and other eternal avenues that are not related to search engines.\n\nAny thoughts y'all may have would be greatly appreciated.",

                "body": "This is a super common and frustrating problem to deal with.\n\nThe core of the issue you're describing is a discrepancy between what Google Ads registers as a click and what Google Analytics (GA) registers as a page view.\n\nThere are a few likely culprits, and it's a good idea to check them all.\n\nFirst, let's address your question about Search Partners.\n\nYes, it's possible that traffic from Search Partners could contribute to this discrepancy.\n\nWhen a user clicks on an ad on a partner site, there might be a slight delay or a technical issue that prevents the GA script from firing, even though the click is registered in Google Ads.\n\nIt's a contributing factor, but it's rarely the sole reason for a 10x difference.\n\nA much bigger issue is often a misconfiguration in GA itself, as you suspected.\n\nThe fact that you're also seeing issues with UTM-tagged links is a huge red flag.\n\nThis points to problems with how your GA tracking code is implemented or how it's firing.\n\nMaybe it's not on every page, or maybe it's being blocked by browser extensions, or perhaps there's a problem with the page loading time where the user leaves before the GA script has a chance to execute.\n\nThis is often the biggest cause of the discrepancy.\n\nA click is counted in Google Ads the moment the user initiates it, but a page view in GA isn't counted until the page loads and the GA script fires.\n\nSo, how do you fix this and get a more reliable picture?\n\nThis is where the Google Ads Conversion API combined with Google Tag Manager and Stape.io comes in.\n\nThe traditional method of tracking uses client-side data, meaning the user's browser is responsible for sending the information.\n\nThis is what you're currently doing with the GA script, and it's vulnerable to all the issues we've talked about: ad blockers, slow page loads, and browser settings.\n\nThe Google Ads Conversion API, also known as server-side tracking, flips this around.\n\nInstead of the browser sending the data directly to Google, you send the data from your server to Google's server.\n\nThis creates a much more reliable and robust connection.\n\nHere's how the pieces fit together: you would use Google Tag Manager (GTM) to set up a server-side container.\n\nInstead of sending a `page_view` event directly to GA from the user's browser, you'd send that data to your own server-side GTM container.\n\nStape.io provides the infrastructure for this, acting as a cloud service that hosts your server-side GTM container.\n\nOnce the data is in your server-side container, you can then forward it to Google Ads using the Conversion API.\n\nThis means that a `page_view` event or a `purchase` event, which you track on your site, is sent to Google Ads from your server.\n\nThis bypasses all the client-side issues like ad blockers and browser-based tracking prevention.\n\nThe result is a much more accurate and complete picture of your conversions, which directly ties back to the clicks you're paying for in Google Ads.\n\nIt's a more advanced setup, but it‚Äôs the gold standard for reliable tracking today and would drastically reduce the kind of discrepancy you're seeing.",

All events, including eCommerce events, are firing correctly in the GTM debug mode. However, we're experiencing some strange issues in Google Analytics 4 (GA4):\n\n1. Only some conversions are being recorded in GA4, despite the events firing correctly in GTM.\n2. Traffic from European countries (our target market) isn't showing up in GA4 at all. Instead, we only see a small amount of traffic from non-targeted countries.\n\nWe've double-checked our GTM setup and ensured that all tags, triggers, and variables are properly configured. Could this be a data privacy (e.g., GDPR) issue, a consent mode problem, or something else entirely?\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar or have any ideas on how to troubleshoot this?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

                "body": "Hey u/No_Entrance_3068,\n\nRegarding: \"events fire but EU data disappears\" problem - when GTM shows everything working correctly but your target European market vanishes from GA4 entirely.\n\nSince your ecommerce events fire correctly in GTM debug mode, this ISN'T a loading issue - PixelYourSite and GTM are installed properly.\n\nSince some conversions do record and non-EU traffic appears, this ISN'T a configuration issue - your tracking foundation works.\n\nThis IS a **privacy compliance issue** - your consent management is blocking European users from being tracked, which means you're losing visibility into your primary target market.\n\nHere's how to diagnose exactly what's happening with consent mode and EU traffic blocking:\n\n**How to run this diagnostic:**\n1. Hit F12 on your keyboard\n2. Click the \"Console\" tab\n3. Copy and paste this code snippet\n4. Press Enter to run it\n\n```javascript\n(() => {\n  // Check consent mode and GDPR blocking patterns\n  const checks = {\n    gtm_loaded: !!window.google_tag_manager,\n    dataLayer_exists: typeof dataLayer !== 'undefined',\n    consent_mode_active: typeof dataLayer !== 'undefined' ?\n      dataLayer.some(e => e.event && e.event.includes('consent')) : false,\n    ga4_requests: performance.getEntriesByType('resource')\n      .filter(e => e.name.includes('/g/collect')).length,\n    gdpr_signals: document.querySelector('[class*=\"gdpr\"], [class*=\"consent\"], [class*=\"cookie\"]') ? 'Found' : 'None'\n  };\n\n  console.log('üîç EU Traffic + Consent Mode Diagnostic:');\n  console.table(checks);\n\n  // Check for consent state\n  if (typeof dataLayer !== 'undefined') {\n    const consentEvents = dataLayer.filter(e =>\n      e.event && (e.event.includes('consent') || e.event.includes('gdpr'))\n    );\n    console.log('Consent events found:', consentEvents);\n\n    // Check current consent state\n    if (window.gtag) {\n      console.log('Current consent state - check gtag consent defaults');\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    diagnosis: checks.consent_mode_active ?\n      'Consent mode detected - check EU consent defaults' :\n      'No consent mode - GDPR may be blocking all EU traffic',\n    action: 'Check if consent_mode is configured for European visitors'\n  };\n})();\n```\n\nThis will show you if consent mode is configured and identify what's blocking your European traffic.\n\nThe \"EU traffic missing + partial conversions\" pattern indicates:\n1. **Consent mode misconfiguration** - EU visitors blocked entirely instead of cookieless tracking\n2. **GDPR banner setup** - Banner blocking analytics completely for EU users\n3. **Default consent state** - Not configured for denied‚Üígranted consent flow\n4. **Geographic consent logic** - Different consent behavior for EU vs non-EU visitors\n\nSince Europe is your target market, losing this data completely undermines your ability to understand and optimize for your core audience.\n\nAre you seeing any consent-related events in your dataLayer, or does your GDPR banner completely block tracking for European visitors?",

It looks to me like they are in the Direct count for some reason. If my assumption is right that anyone opting out of cookies wont appear in these figures, and I know about a 1/3 are opting out, then adjusting the Dec, Jan and Feb figures would suggest a similar number of users to the other months.

I've set up BigQuery, and am successfully exporting to it each day... but...\n\nI noticed alot of events lacked ga_session_ids (only 6% have them) and it's my understanding this is what's used to determine the number of sessions (with pseudo_id) in GA front end. The front end matches this count when I do it in BQ.\n\nI made a custom sessionID as a test via GTM and found my custom one aligns with the ga ones where it exists, but my custom one is pulling alot more.\n\nA third party marketing firm and a legacy tool (which I found out about today) both give numbers closer to my custom sessionID quantity. \n\nThe questions are:\n1 - From the above, does it seem GA is under reporting sessions? Is that how the front end works?\n2 - What's gone wrong? GTM is sending data (proved by custom sessionID), it's getting into BQ and GA, and Google are making IDs some of the time. It seems extream if 94% are blocking tracking? I can't fathom where the missing link is.\n\nThanks for any help or advice in advance!",

I noticed that despite having entire departments dedicated to analytics and tracking it was still difficult to get it right. I figured if big companies have these issues they also apply to smaller ones.\n\nThats why i have started a little side project aiming to make analytics simpler for smaller companies. The idea is to build a service that allows you to create links and track stats for each individual link. That includes:\n\n* what product pages are visited after landing on the link destination\n* conversion rate, add to cart rate, purchase rate for the various pages the customer visits after clicking the link\n\nThe plan is to build it on top of GA4 so you wont have to integrate with yet another service. So my question for you guys is, do you think a tool like this would be usefull?\n\n\n\nIf yes, i am currently looking for a few people to interview about their tracking needs and later someone who would be interested in joining as beta testers for the solution. Please also dont be shy to leave a comment if you hate the idea aswell, all feedback is much appreciated!",

I've had a look at just about everything (I think) and cannot find the reason why! So far, I've been over the following:\n\n\\-filters (no filters would be blocking it)  \n\\-codes implemented in the right place on the site (we're using GTM to have GA4 on)  \n\\-cookie banner & consent settings (all sorted too; for reference, the plugin we're using is called Cookie Consent Banner)\n\nEverything looks normal in GA4 but I cannot pinpoint the exact issue. Did anyone else have a similar situation?\n\n",

You can get modeled data to appear if you have enough traffic that says no to being tracked and yes to being tracked (1,000 no and 1,000 yes per day for 7 days out of the past 28 days). But if you don't meet that threshold, anyone saying no to being tracked, would not show up in GA4. And note that even if you get modeled data, it isn't actually what people who refused consent are doing -- it's GA4's best guess at what they did. I hope that helps!",

Ensure that you‚Äôve exactly matched the event category, action, and label names in GA4 with what you‚Äôve set up in GTM. Another thing to check is that you've properly linked your GTM and GA4 accounts, and there are no tagging conflicts or filters that might be blocking the data. Also, it can sometimes take a bit of time for new events to start showing up in GA4, so give it a day and check back.  \n  \nIf you're still having issues, dive into your troubleshooting by using the Google Analytics Debugger Chrome extension to see exactly what‚Äôs being sent to GA4 when those custom events are fired. By comparing the console logs with what you expect, you might uncover any discrepancies. Remember to also verify that you‚Äôve published your changes in GTM. Sometimes the simplest things can trip us up.  \n  \nBy the way, I'm Dhruv from StatsPro, where I've seen a smoother setup and real-time event tracking help avoid these hassles.

Is started with just few hundred sessions each day but now we are at roughly 10000 sessions a day which messes up our stats quite a bit. \n\nMost of this traffic ignores our cookie consent popup, which is why we see only a very small percentage in GA4. But we have another web analytics tool which allows privacy-compliant tracking of all traffic and there we see all this traffic.\n\nThe traffic all goes to the homepage and the bounce rate is around 98%, which would normally indicate bot traffic. But apart from the bounce rate the traffic looks fairly normal - the IP-addresses vary a lot (retrieved from our server logs) and the distribution of user agents, screen sizes or browser language settings is roughly the same as for our other users.\n\nI could simply exclude this referrer from our reporting, but I am wondering whether it might be some misconfigured adserver or similar which might also be used for legit purposes. Therefore I thought I would check here first.\n\nDoes one of you maybe know where this traffic comes from or has seen this referrer in their own data?\n\nThanks\n\nClaudia",

Depending on user consent status, if a GCLID is present and if UTM parameters are present, we have improved our logic that sets source and medium values.

For context, we‚Äôre currently seeing direct traffic make up about 16% of our total web visits and over 70% of our app visits.\n\nHow does this compare to your experience? What percentage of your traffic comes directly to your sites and apps? Are there any trends or insights you‚Äôve noticed about direct traffic in your industry? Any tips to improve these numbers?\n\nWe do tag ALL campaigns, we do mostly google ads and email marketing.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

If you aren't doing much marketing but your brand is well known, direct can climb. If you ramp up paid advertising or focus on your organic more, that direct can drop. It can also fluctuate depending on timing and spend of ads (ads on, direct % lower, ads off, direct % higher). \n\nHere's a specific example. eCommerce website that runs paid ads at specific times throughout the year, direct traffic drops to below 10% of total traffic. When ads are off or slowed down, direct jumps to around 20% (also considering other efforts like SEO, Email, Social). \n\nHope that helps!",

We were wondering if this was down to people hitting the 'reject cookies' option, so GA4 session numbers drop. Has anyone else experienced this with their cookie consent platform, or knows if this could be behind the large drop in traffic we're seeing?\n\nWe're also finding that our Google Ad clicks are much higher than sessions (from Google CPC) on GA4. I know that these are measured in different ways, but the difference is quite large. We've done some further research online and read a bunch of articles, and can confirm:\n\n* our tag is implemented correctly\n* our website loads at a decent speed, so shouldn't be a slow load issue - for most anyway\n* there are no redirects on the PPC landing pages\n* our Google Ads and GA4 accounts are linked\n\nWe send reporting out via Looker Studio - we're seeing the discrepancies between G Ads and GA4 and are finding it hard to explain why and also how to 'fix' it or have solutions in place.\n\nAs I've said, any help is much appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance for any replies.",

Here‚Äôs what might be happening:\n\n1. **Multiple Containers/Implementations**: If you have more than one Google Tag Manager container or multiple instances of Google Analytics code installed (e.g., a hardcoded GA snippet and a GTM implementation), this can lead to the creation of multiple `_ga_*` cookies. You'd want to check if there are duplicate GA setups.\n2. **Different Properties**: GA4 can generate different `_ga_*` cookies if you are tracking multiple properties (e.g., a universal analytics property and a GA4 property). Each property would have its own set of cookies but they shouldn‚Äôt interfere with each other in terms of data collection.\n3. **Cookie Consents**: If your site has cookie consent management in place (such as Google Consent Mode), it may handle cookies differently based on user consent, but this shouldn't duplicate data either.\n\nTo solve this:\n\n* **Check the source of both cookies**: Use your browser's developer tools to inspect what is setting each cookie (they might have different origins).\n* **Remove or combine duplicate setups**: If there are multiple GA installations, decide which one to keep and remove the redundant implementation.\n* **Ensure clean GTM setup**: Double-check that only one set of tags is firing for GA4.\n\nIf there's no visible issue in your testing, and the visitor count isn't inflated, this might not be a serious problem, but cleaning up duplicate cookies is good practice for performance and clarity.",

        "selftext": "Sup GA4 community.\n\nI currently work at a marketing agency in a big city in North America. My team mostly does data collection as well as consent management. I basically do a mix of many things :\n\n- needs identification, elicitation, requirements management, etc... business analysis stuff\n- redacting tracking plans\n- quality assurance for dataLayer and GTM tagging. I've also done *some* Adobe Launch\n- I run consent management projects end-to-end (advanced knowledge of Didomi, OneTrust, Consent Mode. Very well versed in GTM consent management)\n- relations with customer-side business folks, devs and business analysts\n- provide GA4 and GTM training to business and technical end-users\n\nOn the more technical side, I can write some production ready javascript or SQL, albeit with the help of a code assistant. I'm nowhere near data engineer proficiency.\n\nI come from an eCommerce business analysis background. Been doing eCommerce and data stuff for right around 6 years now. When it comes to diplomas, I only hold a university certificate (1 year / 30 credits) in business analytics.\n\nI've come to you today to ask for advice with regards to my certification and educational resume. I want to gain some **meaningful** credentials. Can you guys suggest some professional or expert-level certifications or degrees I could start working towards ?\n\nI just spent a shit ton of my education budget which was gonna expire/renew at the end of last month. I've purchased my CIPP exam (Certified Information Privacy Professional) and I also snagged the CIPT education material. I also purchased the GCP Associate Cloud Engineer certification (at one point I held a triple foundation-level certification - AWS CCP + GCP CDL + Azure AZ-900). I'm not fully convinced I want to get more actual data analysis credentials.. I'm moreso interested in privacy management as well as business analysis. I'm probably eligible for the CCBA exam from the IIBA (the associate-level certification in business analysis). I've also considered accelerating through a WGU bachelors degree so i can enter a masters program at my local business school. I got 2000$ fresh dollars to spend in my training budget @ work.\n\nI feel like I'm all over the place. Please help. I know I'm asking for a lot, but I truly appreciate y'alls input.",

There's just something so satisfying about your stimulated shipping cost matching a transporters quote down to the penny.\n\nHobby-wise, I love long distance cycling, strength and endurance sports, I collect contemporary art, I enjoy hard sci-fi, survival games, camping, and much more..\n\nI'm really not looking to become an entrepreneur. I don't need a gig - I already have a job in consulting. Doing self-employed consulting in analytics on the side is a big no-no in my job contract.. However I think I'd really like to become a course lecturer in the future.\n\nLike I said I'm looking for training/educational ressources. Job security is never guaranteed.

In addition other great ways to get a higher consent rate are: late consent and contextual consent. Just google them to find out more.\n\n  \nGoogle Consent Mode offers two types of implementation approaches: basic and advanced. When implementing the advanced approach you will see more data in GA4 because Google will do a kind of statistical projection.\n\n  \nWhatever you decide to do to get more data, please make sure to stay compliant. There are laws like CCPA, GDPR etc. For instance using red for the \"deny\" button and green for the \"accept\" button might be considered as nudging and not be compliant. Also Google Consent Mode advanced might be considered not compliant depending on your country.",

One thing to flag on the Shopify front, I've found for a few of my clients that Shopify sites have a script that we can't remove that uses a gtag function to set consent states. If you load the site in preview mode and see a lot of events on the left hand side called \"Consent\" you may have the same script.\n\nIf the script is setting the consent flags to denied, it's possible your tags are sending unconsented pings to GA4, which probably won't appear in your dataset. Unconsented pings do eventually appear in the data, but modelling needs to kick in, which can take weeks\n\nI appreciate that was quite technical, not sure how familiar you are with the space. If you'd like someone to take a look at it, I'd be happy to send you a link to my agency's website, and I can try to solve the problem for you.",

Basically, when a user doesn't consent, the tag still fires but it sends the data as an unconsented ping. GA4 knows a page_view (or any other event) has happened, but it's not tied to a specific user. Then, after a couple of weeks, GA4 begins to model the unconsented pings and fills in the gaps in the data.\n\nFor example, it can look at your consented data and see 20 users and 100 page views. If the unconsented pings report 200 page_views, it'll estimate there were 40 users among the unconsented traffic and add that to reports. That's a massive oversimplification, but it's generally how it works. Modelling consented data with Advanced Consent Mode is the best way to stay GDPR compliant, and to stay on Google's good side.",

Before this date, we had 95% of our events triggered by France and now we only have a few events a day, almost all triggered outside of France (maybe bots ? Because we mainly have french clients).\n\nRegarding the sales and our activity I know that there isn't a huge decrease of visitors.\n\nI tried a lot of tutorial to fix my GA4 but no one worked. I tried to debug with Google Tag Assistant and the assistant find my Google Tag, which is correct, and the assistant do detect many events (each time I click somewhere on my website)...

Unfortunately I don't have access to the account so I can't just dig into dimensions to sort it out like I normally would.  Here's what I do know:  \n  \n- The setup is a fairly standard e-commerce setup in GA4 via GTM  \n- In early March, attribution for one paid traffic source changed sharply, both revenue and conversion numbers.  The advertiser has a conversion point and confirmed that performance hasn't changed, but we saw a big change in GA4 totals.  \n- The website owner claims nothing was changed in the account or implementation, and nothing was changed on the advertiser side  \n- When I asked the site to pull last month by date and by campaign, I see a different conversion total but same revenue number.  This one has me a bit stumped.  Example is:  by date I see 35 conversions for $916 and by campaign I see 29 conversions for $916.\n\nBased on this alone, can I point to anything specific?  I'm leaning towards there being a change in consent, or a big swing in traffic that affected the GA modeling... but curious if others have ideas based on this?  Thanks!  \n",

If this is Google Ads, check the link and see if there is a tagging template or something else that could be throwing things off.\n\nSorry I don't have more solutions, this is a weird one for sure!

We know this is not the case as we've had well over 100 users come from Google Ads and lead forensics is saying we have around 3+ Irish users a day on the site. \n\nI've implemented a CMP and we have a 30% decline rate so its not like people are refusing to allow us to track them.\n\nDirect traffic also accounts for at least 50% of our traffic which tells me somethings not right with the set up or communication between the website and tag. \n\n**Possible Causes**\n\nI was thinking it might have something to do with the install but everything is firing okay in GTM and GA4 and as high as possible in the header and body. \n\nI'm now wondering if website speed could be the issue, we're getting an F on GT-Metrics. Is it possible the website is loading too slow for the information to be parsed (even thought its loaded almost immediately due to the fact the tag is prioritised in the header?)\n\nWould server side tagging help?\n\nI'd be very grateful of other ideas that might be contributing to the issue.",

Check the Chrome dev tools console by inspecting the page and then see if any red error messages popping up to do with your GA.\n\nOr the CMP is incorrectly configured with your GTM and blocking all (most of) your users hits even when they accept cookies. Do some tests where you accept cookies and check Chrome dev tools console and go to network tab and search for \"Collect\" and if there are network responses click on them to check they are GA's and if so also check the gcs= param to ensure its value = G111 (if its G100 it means you are sending 'denied' cookie consent for ad and analytics storage and would mean you have an issue) if you clicked accept all cookies (this is consent mode signal) and therefore this would indicate you are ok and if not then shows their is an issue with your config",

                "body": "This is a very common and frustrating issue, and you're not alone in facing it.\n\nThere are several reasons why you'll almost always see more clicks in Google Ads than sessions in GA4, and a discrepancy of around 10-20% is considered normal.\n\nThe primary reason is that \"clicks\" and \"sessions\" are two different metrics.\n\nGoogle Ads counts a click when a user interacts with your ad, but a GA4 session isn't recorded until the page fully loads and the GA4 tracking code fires.\n\nIf a user clicks your ad but hits the back button before the page loads, Google Ads still counts the click, but GA4 doesn't count a session.\n\nOther common reasons include users who have ad blockers or certain browser privacy settings that prevent tracking scripts from running, or situations where a user clicks an ad multiple times within a 30-minute window, which Google Ads counts as multiple clicks but GA4 records as a single session.\n\nNow, for a more robust and reliable solution, many marketers are turning to a server-side tracking setup using Google Tag Manager with a service like Stape.io.\n\nThis approach helps to overcome many of the issues you're experiencing.\n\nBy implementing the Google Ads Conversion API, you can send conversion data directly from your server to Google Ads.\n\nInstead of relying on the user's browser to send the data (which can be blocked by ad blockers, privacy settings, or slow loading times), the server-side setup ensures that the data is sent more reliably.\n\nYou can set up your web GTM container to send a `purchase` or other `Standard Events` to a server-side GTM container hosted on Stape.io.\n\nThe server container then processes that event and sends the information directly to the Google Ads Conversion API.\n\nThis helps to improve the accuracy of your conversion data and reduces the discrepancy between what Google Ads reports and what GA4 records, giving you a more complete picture of your campaign performance.",

Using a customer data platform that allows for segmentation or scrubbing a certain data has to occur before you can send information to Google analytics, Google ads, etc. There are very few platforms that currently specialize in healthcare and simplify this process. I was hoping that Google might offer some way to manage this. As Google will not sign a business associate agreement, which allows you to send certain data points, you end up having to pay money to use their free tools.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion within the healthcare community as the rules have changed regarding HIPAA. So, for instance, in Washington state perusing a page as a user that contains healthcare information and sending an IP address to ga is considered identifying information and is now illegal. So there is HIPAA, which already states there are 18 identifying factors which are now violations and an ever increasing privacy situation. Look up Washington state my health, my data.",

        "author": "RoastPotatoSandwich",
        "id": "19d9fxc",
        "selftext": "My client runs a website that functions as a directory of marketing experts. On this website, each marketing expert has a dedicated page where the URL and the page title include the name of the expert.\n\nNow, here's the twist: The PII involved is not about the users of the site, but rather about the marketing experts listed in the directory. These experts have consented to have their names displayed in this way. However, I'm curious about the implications this might have in terms of Google Analytics 4 (GA4) regulations, specifically regarding PII.\n\nThe marketing expert can log into their page and update their data and we are collecting User ID. So in theory I can connect the name and the User ID to identift this user.\n\nFrom my understanding, GA4 has strict policies against the collection and storage of PII, which generally includes data that can identify, contact, or locate a person. In our case, the names of these experts in URLs or page titles could be considered PII. However, since this information is not about the site's visitors but about the listed individuals who have given their consent, I'm unsure if this still poses an issue under GA4's PII policies.\n\nMy considerations are as follows:\n\n* PII of Listed Individuals: The inclusion of the experts' names might be a concern for their privacy, but they have consented to this usage.\n* Analytics Data: GA4 focuses on user data. Since we‚Äôre not collecting personal data about the visitors, it seems like it might not be an issue from this angle.\n* Consent and Disclosure: The experts have agreed to have their names used in this manner, but does this fully mitigate potential issues with GA4?\n* Google Analytics Terms: I'm also contemplating whether this usage conflicts with Google Analytics‚Äô terms of service in any way.\n* I'm leaning towards the idea that while this might not be a direct GA4 user PII concern, it still warrants careful consideration, especially in terms of consent and legal compliance.\n\nI would appreciate any insights, or opinions on this matter. Do you think this setup violates GA4 PII regulations, or does the consent from the listed experts and the focus on their information (not the site users‚Äô) change the situation?",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR: Seeking GDPR-compliant analytics strategies for SMEs with <1000 daily visitors that don't compromise data due to lack of cookie consent. How do we track website metrics like traffic, source/medium, and conversions without PII and still gain comprehensive insights? Looking for advice on tools, techniques, and best practices that ensure insightful, compliant analytics without data loss from non-consent sessions. Eager to hear your experiences and solutions.**\n\nHello, Reddit marketing and privacy enthusiasts!\n\nI'm tackling the complex intersection of GDPR compliance and effective data analytics for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly those with less than 1000 daily visitors on their websites. The crux of the matter is how to responsibly track user behavior and campaign success without breaching privacy regulations or relying heavily on personally identifiable information (PII).\n\nThe challenge intensifies with the GDPR imposing strict guidelines on data collection, leaving us questioning the extent to which we can monitor website metrics like traffic sources, engagement, and conversions in a privacy-respecting manner. This has become especially pertinent in light of recent clampdowns on cookie usage and the requirement for explicit user consent, which has undeniably impacted our ability to collect comprehensive analytics.\n\n**Here are the pressing questions:**\n\n‚Ä¢\tHow do you navigate GDPR restrictions to gather useful website metrics without overstepping privacy boundaries, especially in the context of SMEs?\n\n‚Ä¢\tHave you found innovative or privacy-friendly tools and techniques that provide valuable insights without infringing on user privacy?\n\n‚Ä¢\tFor those managing websites with fewer than 1000 daily visitors, how do you ensure your data analytics practices are both insightful and compliant (without compromising on loss of data)?\n\n‚Ä¢\tI'm keen to hear if others are experiencing similar challenges with GDPR compliance and how it's affecting your ability to conduct thorough analyses for clients.\n\nI'm looking for shared experiences, advice, or any insights on balancing the need for data-driven marketing with the imperative of privacy compliance. How far can we really go in tracking and analyzing our website traffic within the bounds of the GDPR, and what best practices should we adopt to safeguard our efforts against potential pitfalls?\n\n*Appreciate your input and looking forward to learning from this community!*",

Initial thoughts were\n\n* Was it linked to the consent mode v2 changes on the 6th March?\n* Was there some change in the site causing sessions to get restarted?\n\nThe strange things is this - when changing to \"device-based\" reporting identity all of the traffic looks normal, but both blended and observed show the attribution changes. We didn't think that consent mode should have had an impact on this, and the fact that \"observed\" showed the change as well made us wonder if something was happening regarding user\\_id tracking, but no changes that we know of have happened in this regard \n\nMore info\n\n* The site is split into 2 sub-domains for the brochure side and booking side (not cross-domain).\n* Overall sessions haven't increased or decreased.\n* Same GTM and GA4 being used across both sub-domains\n* Overall traffic hasn't been lost, just the attribution has changed\n* When changing to \"device-based\" reporting identity, the attribution goes back to looking as it did previously\n* When comparing a previous time period before 21st March, all 3 reporting identities report the same values.\n* The change doesn't look gradual over time, just an immediate switch from one attribution to the other\n* We can't identify any coding or config changes within the website that might have caused this to happen (but doesn't that wasn't something that we might have missed or overlooked)\n* There is no consent mode setting happening apart from the enforced v2 changes i.e. I can see a gcd parameter in the GA4 traffic, but no gcs parameter\n   * There isn't a cookie management platform in place (there should be, but here we are, something we are suggesting should happen regardless of this issue)\n* There isn't any remarketing activity happening, mostly SEO and organic.\n* The attribution change is almost entirely in the booking sub-domain\n* There is some attribution change on the homepage (more traffic obviously than other pages) from the same period, but it's insignificant in comparison (not dismissing this info, just don't know how to use it)\n* There hasn't been a change in landing pages potentially showing that the sessions are continuing as they were\n\nWe are a bit of a loss as to what is going on, and whether it could be linked to consent mode. It feels there is an answer given all of the bits of info, but we can't figure it out.\n\nAny insights would be very much appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \nJarrod",

        "selftext": "\r  \n\r  \nGoogle Analytics 4 (GA4) is the latest version of Google's web analytics platform, designed to provide more advanced insights into user behavior across multiple platforms and devices. The working process of Google Analytics 4 involves several key steps:\r  \n‚≠ê Data Collection: GA4 collects data from various sources, including websites, mobile apps, and other digital platforms. It uses a combination of JavaScript tracking code for websites and SDKs (Software Development Kits) for mobile apps to gather data.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Event Tracking: GA4 focuses heavily on event-based tracking rather than pageviews. Events represent user interactions with content on your site or app, such as button clicks, form submissions, video views, and purchases. Events are customizable and allow for detailed tracking of user behavior.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Data Processing: Once data is collected, GA4 processes it in real-time to generate reports and insights. This processing includes aggregating and analyzing event data to provide meaningful metrics and dimensions.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Machine Learning: GA4 incorporates machine learning capabilities to provide more advanced insights and predictions. This includes features such as predictive analytics, which can forecast future user behavior based on historical data patterns.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Reporting: GA4 offers a range of reports and dashboards to visualize data and metrics. These reports cover various aspects of user engagement, acquisition, behavior, and conversions. Users can customize reports and set up alerts to monitor key metrics.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Audience Segmentation: GA4 allows users to create custom audiences based on specific criteria, such as demographics, interests, and user behavior. This segmentation enables targeted marketing campaigns and personalized experiences.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Integration with Google Marketing Platform: GA4 seamlessly integrates with other Google Marketing Platform products, such as Google Ads and Google Tag Manager. This integration allows for better tracking and optimization of marketing campaigns across multiple channels.\r  \n\r  \n‚≠ê Privacy and Compliance: GA4 prioritizes user privacy and compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA. It provides features for data retention controls, user consent management, and data deletion requests.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, the working process of Google Analytics 4 involves collecting, processing, and analyzing data from various sources to provide insights into user behavior and performance metrics, ultimately helping businesses make data-driven decisions and optimize their digital marketing strategies.\r  \n\r  \nüëâüèº If you have more queries, feel free to ask me anytime üëàüèº",

You‚Äôll always see at least one for your own GA4, and if you're using the Google & YouTube app for Merchant Center or Google Ads, it might be adding another. But the extra ones you‚Äôre seeing probably come from third-party apps or services embedded on your site.\n\nThings like review widgets (Yotpo, Judge.me), chat apps, email platforms, or even embedded YouTube videos can inject their own GA4 tags. Some of these services track usage through their own Analyticss accounts, which causes extra '\\_ga\\_XXXX' cookies to appear.\n\nTo figure out which ID belongs to what, open your browser‚Äôs DevTools by hitting F12 or right-click > 'inspect', go to the Network tab, and look for GA4 collect requests (filter for something like 'collect?v=2'). Each request will include a 'tid=G-XXXXXXX' which is the Measurement ID. You can match these back to the cookie names.\n\nAlso check your installed apps and your theme code to see if anythings hardcoding other GA tags or loading third-party scripts. And if you're using server-side GTM, make sure you're not accidentally duplicating tracking somewhere.\n\nHope this helps!",

For the most part, standard web analytics user tracking applications will work just fine.\n\nThe issue is more with some of the GA4 advertising features. GA4 technically has had the capabilities of attributing website sessions to various forms of advertising. This included ad interactions where a user viewed an ad but didn‚Äôt click immediately and then later went to your website and explored and converted. 3P cookies are a way of identifying a user on one domain and then being able to recognize them on another - so the ability to serve a user a display ad on publisher123.com and then to recognize and properly attribute them to that ad view is one of the main features that is somewhat impacted. Another one would be if you use GA4 audiences for remarketing. Remarketing is an action that requires a lot of 3P cookies currently to identify a user on your website and reach them on other 3P inventory.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not as concerned with some of the remarketing and view through conversion applications of GA4, 3P cookie deprecation doesn‚Äôt really seem like a big deal for you.\n\nFor some use cases that require 3P cookies, you can instead update your GA4 events to collect hashed User Provided Data in order to recover some of the 3p cookie functionality that has been/will be lost.",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI work for a small ecommerce company managing digital marketing and the website including SEO. We are hosted on Squarespace. The site is 6 years old, and I took the site management over in 5 years ago. Since taking over in 2020 There has been a fairly consistent growth in page views and visitors  according to google analytics and squarespace analytics. If there was ever a \"dip\" in the KPIs, it lasted only a month or two then resumed the normal rate of slow yet steady growth.\n\nIn May I implemented the new google cookie rules (options for both accept and decline). After that we have seen continuous drops in our page views and visitors. Our google search impressions are going up consistently month by month, and our google search clicks are staying steady, oscillating up and down but more or less the same (with google clicks there is no overall growth or decline, just stagnation).\n\nI've been working consistently on SEO, our onpage audits are always good (speed, headings, etc), and recently I have been reworking our meta data and content to reflect new keyword strategies.\n\nI am assuming this declind/stagnation is due to the cookies change because that is the first month I noticed it.\n\nAs another note, consequential or not I do not know, until 2024 I used squarespace analytics and google analytics in conjunction as they were always very similar, within 1% of each other on visit data. However, in the last months of 2023 and fisrt month of 2024 I noticed that squarespace began to jump wildly, sometimes showing a literal 1000% growth in one month, where google portrayed the usual small but steady growth rate. Then squarespace would drop to near 0, then back up way high. It was so wild and varied, and squarespace tech support gave me 0 answers (or rather, they told me their analytics were mere estimation tools and were not 100% accurate), so as of February of 2024 I switched to 100% only google analytics, only trusting squarespace for KPIs such as form submissions or order info.\n\nHas anyone noticed in the last 6 months declines in traffic? With the new cookie laws is it possible that google is no longer able to accurately track visits, page views, and visitor data?\n\nThank you for any help or advice.",

        "author": "Semboxsrl",
        "id": "1eia6ym",
        "selftext": "As you may, or may not, know, Chrome has been trying for years now to adapt their navigation to a cookie-less enviroment. First tests on Privacy Sandbox (you can find all the infos here https://privacysandbox.com/), started 6th february 2024, resulted in high-hopes by the publishers and an overall euphoria, given by the possibility to have a session-based traffic (on-device processing, meaning all meaningful events are saved directly on the device, without the need of a stable internet connection or any response from external servers ), a higher user safeguard and an overall open discussion regarding the technical parts of this enviroment, making all stakehoders involved into the development.  \nIs of few days ago the decision from Google to \"hold onto\" third-party-cookie (in Chrome) for the time being, giving the direct choice to the users to either remove the third-party-cookies or keeping them.  \n  \nI have, as the major stakeholders, mixed feeling about the Privacy Sandbox:  \n**Pros**:  \nhis update would level Chrome to other browsers (Firefox, Safari etc.) which already adopted a no-third-party-cookie approach to the navigation. The on-device processing measurement would be a huge benefit for all Marketing Agencies and Freelancers, since you would get a timely report of your campaings. Another useful part of this Privacy Sandbox, expecially for all you privacy savvys, is a much more clear collection process regarding the personal information of the user, made more intuitive for non-tecnical user.\n\n  \n**Cons**:  \nYou can find [here](https://www.iabuk.com/news-article/iab-tech-lab-releases-results-privacy-sandbox-gap-analysis) an article by IAB, regarding the analysis made by more then 60+ participant companies in the first round of testing.  \nIn this analysis emerges the huge gap that would be created with Privacy Sandbox, and I quote:  \n‚Äúseveral crucial functions within Sandbox ‚Äì including frequency capping, video advertising, audience creation, and impression counting ‚Äì ‚Ä¶ either lack support or face limitations‚Äù.  \nThe problem arise with audience management, auction dynamics, creative and rendering, reporting, and technology and interoperability as well.  \n  \nGoogle came back with a response to the IAB article (you can find it [here](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/blog/iab-tech-lab-response)), basically discarding the analysis as \"misunderstood and inaccurate\", and trying to stress the \"broad scope\" of the Privacy Sandbox.  \nThe tests of the enviroment finished on 22th March 2024, with a final consideration by the main stakeholders, an I quote:  \n\"The Privacy Sandbox initiative, while aimed at bolstering user privacy, introduces significant hurdles for the digital ad economy.\"  \nBut the real main concern is for the final users, as stated here:  \n\"In its current form, the Privacy Sandbox may limit the industry‚Äôs ability to deliver **relevant**, **effective** advertising, placing smaller media companies and brands at a significant competitive disadvantage.\"\n\nWhat this means is that, not only that the fear of losing revenues for small media companies is more than real, but expecially this would make Google a real gate-keeper of ADV (CMA has concerns over this as well, as written [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6631088cd0030b10e56a5084/CMA_Q4_2023.pdf). Quoting: \"Google cannot proceed with third-party cookie deprecation until our concerns have been resolved\").\n\n  \n**Final Considerations:**  \nAs stated before the final considerations are... mixed. \n\nI hope this update on the tracking world will bring an easier integration between platforms and a more precise tracking, protecting the user privacy. I do see the logical problem in this (how can I have a precise tracking if the user needs to be anonymous?). The cross-device tracking will always be a thorn in my back, and with this new update, I guess the thorn will stay right in his place.\n\nThis post is for open discussion and personal experience about this update, so please feel free to add or correct any of the information I wrote, given a valid surce.  \nHappy tracking (not for long eheh).",

My sub domain is a landing page that i host on webflow and the main domain is hosted on shopify.\n\nI need to run Google ads directly to the landing page, but they will complete their purchase on shopify. To test this i have just added /?gclid=test123 to the URL on a new cookie free browser window. Now, if i add that appendage to the main domain and go into developer tools it works fine - its staring right back at me albeit with the Shopify nuance. If i then visit my sub-domain its also still there as it carries over - happy days.\n\nHowever, if i first head to my subdomain with a fresher browser window and start there - the cookie just doesn't get registered. Its not in developer tools at all. Any idea how i can fix this ? My assumption is that its important as new visitors will be passing through the subdomain first when they click on our ads.\n\nIts probably worth stating that both the domain and subdomain are setup using G tags in GA4, each as their own datastream but in the same property. In debug mode they both register just fine, even if i start on my subdomain with a new browser.\n\nI'm sure for someone with a developer background this is a dead easy fix.\n\nAny advice appreciated!",

We have chosen CookieYes Pro accounts (with a popup modal and reject all button directly available) for all our clients via the GTM method ( you will need all your tags IN the container). \n\nWe are seeing 75-80% accept all stats ( this is without the bouncers that will not choose anything, but that is shit traffic anyway).\n\nAnd to add to that:\n\nYou can use server side tracking for more control over your data and you should use enhanced conversions with hashed PII .",

My understanding is that GA4 and UA both use the presence or absence of the \\_ga cookie to track New Users. My question is if GA4 can recognize cookies placed by UA. To give an example, if a user visits a site with only UA set up, and gets the \\_ga cookie placed in their browser, if they go back to the same site six months later after it's had UA removed and GA4 added, will they show up as a New User in GA4? Or does GA4 only look at \\_ga cookies generated by GA4 itself?",

You will also probably lose any attribution as well, because attribution data by default is present as URL query parameters only on the landing page and if there is no consent, those parameters can't be copied into cookies.\n\nGCM (\"CoMo\" is the shorthand) does have an option to try to preserve this data until consent is granted, but if people just ignore the banner all the way through to a conversion there's not much you can do.\n\nOne strategy I saw a popular beer brand use was an unobtrusive, ignorable banner all the way until the payment page, where it turned into a blocking modal requiring a decision before you could finalise payment.\n\nGenerally, I recommend a blocking modal, front and centre as soon as a user lands.

That shouldn't affect how you make business decisions or evaluate trends based on your data, though. A tool like Google Analytics will never be 100% accurate. What the analytics drop is can vary greatly by any number of factors - the design of your banner, your consent model, your industry, etc...  \n\n\nThe longer answer and can-of-worms is that every cookie consent banner and solution is different. As a matter of fact, over 50% of them don't even do anything if you decline from a study that was done. And some tools, like Google Tag Manager's consent mode, still might even send a cookieless ping to GA4 to track some data if a user opts out.\n\nOr, maybe for EU visitors it requires \"explicit\" consent to set cookies, but in North America it's \"implicit\" and sets cookies by default. This could affect how you analyze traffic between the two regions.\n\nUnfortunately, those are just a few considerations. There is a lot here.\n\nUltimately, you'd need to work with the person that implemented your banner to understand exactly how it works. This can get a bit technical but I think it would be worth your time to work with them to sort it out.",

Until this year Google Analytics was able to track user activity on a particular website for over 30 days, but now for safari users it will only get 24 hours for tracking because ITP has set a 24-hour window for third party cookies to actively collect data if the user didn‚Äôt directly interact with the third party website that set the cookie.

I posted something on the help forum a few weeks ago, no replies. I have tried a few times to contact Google Analytics help, but they have not gotten back to me.\n\nWhat is the fix for this issue? Who else has dealt with this and what did you do? \n\n**EDIT: I found a clumsy work around.** See below for what I did. \n\nThe way that I was finally able to access my Google Analytics account:\n\nI repeatedly was searching ‚Äúmissing permissions error Google Analytics‚Äù etc. One of those many searches led me to this page on the Google Support forum: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6132368?sjid=14850073660619333886-NA\n\nThere‚Äôs a link there to ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù, which takes you to your account‚Äôs admin page. Simply trying to go to analytics.google.com was leading to the missing permissions screen, so you have to find another way to get there.\n\nWhen I reached this admin page, I saw that the first property in my portfolio, in alphabetical order, had recently been moved to the Trash. This was because this client is no longer working with us. Analytics automatically goes to the first property, which I had deleted, so instead of going to the next one it just wouldn‚Äôt let me access my account at all. Makes no sense.\n\nOnce I had reached that admin screen, I was able to click through and access my other properties. \n\nWhat I also did at that time was go into each and every single property & find ‚ÄúAccount access management‚Äù. I added another email address as a backup admin just in case.\n\nSince then, it appears that going to that admin link ‚Äì https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/?pagename=admin&utm_source=gahc&utm_medium=dlinks ‚Äì is a way to get into the account without running into the permissions error. Bookmarking that link has been helpful for me as well. There are probably other ways to get around this error, but finding an alternative way into your account seems to be the answer if you can do it, since https://analytics.google.com just doesn‚Äôt f*cking work if you‚Äôve deleted a property at any time.\n\nThis has been a problem with Google Analytics for 6+ years now. I have seen hundreds of people struggling with this with absolutely zero solutions posted, dating back years, and it appears Google has done nothing to solve this either. There are no definitive fixes posted anywhere for this problem. Absolutely ridiculous. ",

Simply trying to go to analytics.google.com was leading to the missing permissions screen, so you have to find another way to get there.\n\nWhen I reached this admin page, I saw that the first property in my portfolio, in alphabetical order, had recently been moved to the Trash. This was because this client is no longer working with us. Analytics automatically goes to the first property, which I had deleted, so instead of going to the next one it just wouldn‚Äôt let me access my account at all. Makes no sense.\n\nOnce I had reached that admin screen, I was able to click through and access my other properties. \n\nWhat I also did at that time was go into each and every single property & find ‚ÄúAccount access management‚Äù. I added another email address as a backup admin just in case.\n\nSince then, it appears that going to that admin link ‚Äì https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/?pagename=admin&utm_source=gahc&utm_medium=dlinks ‚Äì is a way to get into the account without running into the permissions error. Bookmarking that link has been helpful for me as well. There are probably other ways to get around this error, but finding an alternative way into your account seems to be the answer if you can do it, since https://analytics.google.com just doesn‚Äôt f*cking work if you‚Äôve deleted a property at any time.\n\nThis has been a problem with Google Analytics for 6+ years now. I have seen hundreds of people struggling with this with absolutely zero solutions posted, dating back years, and it appears Google has done nothing to solve this either. There are no definitive fixes posted anywhere for this problem. Absolutely ridiculous. \n\nI hope that this helps you and anyone else dealing with this problem.",

That explains the repeat GA1.1..\n\nIf your GA4 \"client ID\" is showing as \"not set,\" it means that Google Analytics is unable to generate a unique identifier for a user on your website, likely due to issues with your tracking code implementation, cookie settings, or incorrect configuration in your Google Tag Manager, preventing proper user tracking and data collection. \nKey reasons why your GA4 client ID might not be set:\n\nIncorrect tracking code installation:\n\nDouble-check that your GA4 tracking code is correctly placed on every relevant page of your website. \n\nCookie blocking:\n\nBrowser settings or ad-blocking extensions might be preventing the necessary cookies for storing the client ID. \n\nIncorrect Tag Manager setup:\n\nIf using Google Tag Manager, ensure your GA4 tag is configured correctly and firing properly. \n\nCustom user ID not set:\n\nIf you're trying to link user accounts across devices, make sure you are correctly passing a user ID through your tracking code. \n\nServer-side tracking issues:\n\nIf you're using server-side tracking, ensure the client ID is being sent correctly from your server to Google Analytics. \nHow to troubleshoot and fix \"not set\" client ID:\n\nCheck your tracking code:\n\nReview your website's HTML code to confirm the GA4 tracking code is properly placed on every relevant page. \n\nInspect browser cookies:\n\nUse your browser developer tools to check if the necessary GA4 cookies are being set and if their values are correct. \n\nVerify Google Tag Manager configuration:\n\nIf using GTM, review your GA4 tag setup, including the data layer variables and triggers. \nCheck for cookie blocking:\nReview browser settings and any ad-blocking extensions to ensure they are not preventing GA4 cookies. \nReview your user ID implementation:\nIf you are using a custom user ID, double-check that it is being passed correctly to the GA4 tracking code. \nUse Google Analytics Debugger:\nThe Google Analytics Debugger tool can help identify issues with your tracking code by providing real-time feedback on sent data. \nImportant points to remember:\nClient ID is unique per device and browser:\nA user visiting your site from different browsers or devices will be assigned different client IDs. \n\"Not set\" can appear in other dimensions too:\nIf you see \"not set\" in other GA4 reports, it often means missing data due to incorrect tracking setup.",

If they are just there to evaluate the sites performance over time, it's probably your best bet. \n\nHowever, if you are being measured by all of these KPI's, then they seem very broad and a little unfair imo. As an individual I wouldn't think you have the power to change all of them.\n\ne.g. If you're an add specialist, add to carts and abandon carts aren't great KPI's, they are metrics you want to be aware of, but they shouldn't affect your employers view on your performance unless you're in charge of design and UX as well. \n\nIf you're an ads specialist, I would be focusing more on ROAS that you define with your employer.\n\nAt the end of the day, as a digital marketer, the best metric is always going to be, did you increase how much money your company made through your channels by more than the amount it cost to achieve that change in performance. \n\nBoth of those metrics should be available without the data in GA4.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nTo leave you with an actionable, if you feel like not enough people are opting in to cookies. Maybe think about the design, location and layout of your cookie banner. There are definitely ways to optimize opt in rates in ethical ways. \n\nHere‚Äôs a few tips we give our customers to maximize their acceptance rates, hopefully there's something useful in there for you.\n\n1. Test different banner positions - bottom-right corner placement typically achieves higher acceptance rates in our experience. \n2. Use clear, simple language focused on benefits to users rather than technical details. Users make initial judgments about interface elements within 3 seconds. \n3. Maintain visual consistency with your website's design. Don‚Äôt break the experience with contrast, tie the banner to your sites trust. \n4. Trial letting users modify choices by category (essential, marketing, analytics) rather than just using an accept/reject all button. \n5. Test different timings for banner appearance rather than showing it immediately on page load. Sometimes that window of investment gives a user enough momentum to accept if they know they're getting a return from your site.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions\n\nRegards,\n\nAlistair",

They didn't give me any next steps:  \n  \n\"This is where my expertise most likely ends, as from what I can tell, something on your site is either blocking¬†the UTM parameters to properly set the cookie to the parameters. I've tried from different computers, signed in/signed out, different computer (not mine) on a different wifi, sent links for others to try, some with UTMs the same, some with different and not of my UTM parameters¬†that I randomly created and tested (probably about 25) ever showed in your account¬†as traffic coming from.¬† They simply didn't show.¬† Similar to where you found one visit and no others.¬†  \n  \nFrankly I've never seen this and do not know of any setting in GA4 that would prevent this. I should be able to clear¬†my cache or got to a different computer, pop in a random UTM parameter into the URL and see it in the real-time report less than a minute after I hit the page. I can see I hit the page, I can see the parameter in the¬†URL, but still says I'm from direct traffic. I do it as the same time to another site, same random parameter, and in real-time report see the page hit and the¬†UTM campaign parameter I set. I've troubleshooted the basic, right parameters, pages tagged, no issue with length of URL, redirects, etc. all of which has been ruled out. I have to assume it something on the site that is causing it, either blocking it or interfering with it.\"\n\n***Does anyone have insight into this issue? The same issue? A magic wand they can wave so I can stop pulling my hair out?***",

UTMs are URL query string parameters, like any other URL query string parameter. Google 'knows' to treat a select group of 9 URL query string parameters that start with utm\\_ differently from other URL query string parameter and automatically process them into Google Analytics. There is no 'special' effort to process the UTMs with cookies. It sounds like something else is going on. Do you have server side redirect that truncate the incoming URL query strings? Are you miss using the 'standard' events page\\_location or client\\_id in such a way that you are corrupting your data? Generally speaking, you should not touch 'client\\_id'. And you should only modify 'page\\_location' if you have 1) an SPA, and 2) are setting page\\_location to a complete, well formed URL. Otherwise you leave those alone. Do you have Javascript that wipes out the dataLayer? Have you recently implemented a CSP that will block the running of scripts, including Google Analytics? Are you using UTMs on internal links on your web site (you should never do that)? That you see the parameters in the URL and it says \"direct traffic\" is often the result of bad server side redirects that truncate the URL query string parameters.",

We are taking a different approach as an experiment for measuring site usage.\n\nWe are sending a request with a single page\\_view event with the following data\n\n* client\\_id is a guid that is set in a cookie that has a rolling expiry of 2 years i.e. will update on each hit, or get generated if it doesn't exist.\n* session\\_id is a guid that is set in a cookie that has a rolling expiry of 30 minutes. Will update expiry or create a new one if it doesn't exist.\n* engagement\\_time\\_msec is set as an arbitrary \"100\" ms\n* page\\_location for the absolute url\n* page\\_title\n* We aren't sending a timestamp, instead leaving that up to Google (at the moment)\n* There is no attribution, referral or geo information sent with the request. We are interested in totals rather than journey\n\nData all seems to be coming through fine, users and pages in real time, and exploration looks as expected, but the session count seems off, where the session count is always slightly less than the user count.\n\nWe are running GA4 tracking on the client as a separate instance (not linked at all), and the sessions show a lot more, which is what I would expect as users tend to visit the site through-out the day.\n\nBecause this is a pretty much considered a hack, I am not necessarily expecting a \"fix\" but rather an understanding of what is happening.\n\nThanks,  \nJ",

Thought it just needed to be a unique value.\n   * Unix timestamp in seconds won't be unique, but it should be calculated correctly with the combo of client\\_id and session\\_id\n* Added a timestamp\\_micros to the request and for each event. Not sure if that's redundant, but shouldn't hurt\n* Added custom\\_session\\_start and custom\\_first\\_visit events when a new client or session cookie is created. This should hopefully give me same number of sessions on the event count.\n   * You can't send the actual session\\_start and first\\_visit events.

Something to bear in mind though.\n\nI ran some test, firing in hundreds of requests and clearing out the cookies at set points and they all showed up correctly, but the live code changes don't go live till next week, so will drop a note about results then.",

We created a **landing page** for the client where we track **phone calls, thank-you pages,** and other key events via **GA4**. Additionally, all our other media channels (**Meta, Geofencing, etc.**) are **UTM-tagged**, allowing us to track the **source/medium** of traffic and measure **leads, calls, and user activity** during our campaign.\n\nI understand that **soft metrics** like **link clicks** don‚Äôt always translate **1:1** to **GA4 sessions** due to **privacy restrictions and cookie limitations**. However, this discrepancy seems **more pronounced** when analyzing **DV360 data**.\n\n# Example:\n\n* **Meta (December Data)**\n   * **13,947 link clicks**\n   * **12,498 GA4 sessions**\n   * Not a perfect match, but fairly close.\n* **DV360 Lead Gen Campaign**\n   * **8,607 reported clicks**\n   * **143 reported conversions** (tracked through **click-to-call** and a **soft lead button event** on the landing page)\n   * **GA4 Data:**\n      * **67 sessions reported**\n      * **0 soft leads or calls** attributed to the source/medium\n\nUpon further investigation, I noticed that some **landing page query strings** containing **utm\\_source=youtube** were **attributed to Google CPC** instead of YouTube/DV360.\n\n# The Question\n\nWhy is our **YouTube/DV360** data **not appearing** correctly in **GA4**? This issue seems **unique to DV360/YouTube**, as our other channels track properly. Despite **DV360 reporting conversions**, we can‚Äôt **connect** them properly in **GA4**‚Äîpossibly due to **tracking loss** or being **overwritten by Google CPC attribution**.\n\n# Additional Context\n\n* Our **GA4 attribution model** is set to **Data-Driven**, but we are open to testing other models if that could resolve the issue.\n* This discrepancy also occurs with **other third-party vendors running display/OTT (streaming) ads** to a landing page. While streaming traffic behaves differently, I wanted to mention it in case it‚Äôs relevant.\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar issue? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!",

                "body": "This is a very common and frustrating problem when bridging the gap between DV360/YouTube click data and GA4 session/conversion attribution, especially given the increased impact of privacy and tracking restrictions.\n\nThe core of the issue you're seeing is likely a combination of tracking loss due to browser restrictions like Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP), your GA4 attribution model's handling of view-through conversions, and the way GA4's native integrations prioritize data.\n\nThe most likely culprit for the sessions being misattributed to Google CPC is the presence of the gclid parameter on your landing page URL, which is used for Google Ads tracking.\n\nWhen traffic comes from YouTube ads managed through DV360, it often contains both DV360's dclid parameter and the gclid parameter if the inventory is running on YouTube or a Google-owned property and linked to a Google Ads account.\n\nGA4's default processing and the Google Ads integration tend to prioritize the `gclid`, which tells GA4 the click came from a Google-managed source, and it attributes it using the *Google Ads* integration logic, often resulting in attribution to `google / cpc` or \"cross-network\" depending on the campaign type, rather than `dv360 / cpm` or `youtube / cpm` as you might expect.\n\nThe low session count in GA4 (67 sessions vs. 8,607 clicks) strongly suggests high levels of tracking prevention are blocking the GA4 script from firing or cookies from being set, particularly for traffic from in-app or cross-site contexts, which is common for DV360/YouTube.\n\nThe conversions that DV360 reports (143) are likely view-through conversions or attributed based on a *much* longer lookback window and different methodology than GA4's session-based tracking, which explains the enormous discrepancy.\n\nTo address both the tracking loss and the misattribution, you should consider implementing a server-side tagging solution combined with the Google Ads Conversions API (GAC API).\n\nA setup using Google Tag Manager (GTM) for initial data capture, then sending that data through Stape.io (a managed server-side tagging environment) to the GAC API is an excellent solution.\n\nServer-side tracking reduces dependency on client-side browser cookies, making your tracking more resilient against ITP and other privacy-related restrictions.\n\nInstead of the user's browser sending data directly to GA4 and Google Ads, it sends a single, first-party request to your Stape.io server, which then forwards the data to GA4 and the GAC API.\n\nThis method significantly improves the reliability and longevity of user identifiers.\n\nUsing the GAC API allows you to send conversion events directly from your server to Google Ads, providing a more complete and accurate picture of conversion actions that aren't lost due to client-side tracking failures.\n\nThis is particularly good for DV360/YouTube campaigns because it helps Google Ads (which is often linked to DV360) attribute conversions more accurately, even if the GA4 session tracking fails.\n\nFurthermore, by carefully configuring your server-side GTM, you can gain greater control over how the attribution parameters (like gclid or dclid) are handled and passed, potentially allowing you to force attribution to the desired DV360 source, though the native GA4 prioritization will still be strong.\n\nYou will be sending higher-quality, server-validated data to Google, improving conversion modeling and bidding efficiency for your DV360 campaigns.\n\nWhile you're open to testing other attribution models, the underlying tracking loss is the more critical issue, and server-side tagging addresses that head-on.",

From my understanding:\n\n* GA4 does not start a new session when a user returns from a different source/medium, as long as they return within 30 minutes.\n* The original session source remains the same, but the new source/medium is logged at the event level (session\\_source, session\\_medium).\n\nA new session only starts if:\n\n* The user is inactive for 30+ minutes before coming back.\n* The session crosses midnight.\n* The user clears cookies or switches devices.\n\nThis is a major shift from UA‚Äôs behavior, where a new session was always created when a user returned via a different source.\n\nCan anyone confirm if this understanding is correct? And how does this impact session-based vs. event-based reporting in GA4?\n\nWould love to hear insights from those who‚Äôve dug deep into GA4!",

These spikes have, according to Google Analytics, brought in almost 4,000 contact form submission key events over the past 96 days or so. However, this doesn't really make any sense on the other end of things ‚Äî my client has not reported any issues with spam form submissions or even an uptick in form submissions, and the average time spent on the page by all visitors is 2 seconds, which is definitely not enough to fill in all the required fields of the contact form and hit Submit. All traffic driving these spikes originates in the United States. Narrowing visitors down by city reveals an even spread of visitors from a very large range of cities.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what an explanation might be for this? I'm not sure if this is spam, or bots, or genuine statistics, and can't really make sense of the data from my knowledge of the circumstances around it and my limited grasp on how to further diagnose these statistics. Please excuse my ignorance if this question has an obvious answer, I haven't been trained in analytics and I'm just a graphic designer that was put on analytics monitoring duty and I feel completely out of my depth with this issue.

                "body": "Hi! There are three parts to this: 1) GA4 setup, 2) GTM setup, 3) Reporting  \n  \nFirst, here's Google's documentation that I think Op is referring to:\n\n[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9213390?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9213390?hl=en)\n\n1) The GA4 part recommends that you update the reporting identity to include UserID.  I'm not an expert here, and rely on others to add comments, but I believe this is done to enable UseriD to be used in the GA4 UI and to avoid cardinality issues.    There's a bunch of stuff you can do with User Id.\n\n2) The GTM setup is simple: the only difficult part is reading or storing the value in a cookie, or having your devlelopers push it to the data layer.\n\n3) Reporting: This is the most troublesome part....I do NOT recommend sending UserID to your CRM, at least with Phase 1.\n\nI'm assuming that UserID is kept in a separate database?   The web authentication server?  Regardless of where it is, you'll eventually need a report from this source with Customer name, user id, and whatever other data is needed. \n\nYou'll use Looker Studio, or query BigQuery to get the data wantedUserID\n\nI don't see why cardinality would be an issue here.  I saw the Google caution, and I would recommend disregarding it.  Remember, Cardinality is Google's problem, not yours.   They're trying to get people to use data efficiently, I assume.  It should be perfectly fine to run a report based on UserID. It's not like you're going to have millions of unique values..\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nGoogle's documentation spells it out for you here, with step by step instructions for GTM:\n\n[https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/user-id?sjid=6942166150031227692-NC&client\\_type=gtm](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/user-id?sjid=6942166150031227692-NC&client_type=gtm)\n\n1) For this to work, you'll need to have UserID in the data layer for your website.  Have your developers add some code to push it, or read the value from a cookie and push it.   I used to use GTM's custom HTML tag for this type of stuff, but that's frowned upon nowadays:\n\n    dataLayer.push({\n    ¬† 'user_id': 'USER_ID'});\n\n2) Create a variable in GTM for the value\n\n3) Modify the Google tag so this value is a Configuration parameter, using the variable from Step #2.\n\nWith these three steps, UserID will be populated automatically with the user's actions.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*",

Increasing the session timeout duration in the settings can help mitigate it, but you should discuss this with your wider team before you do it.  \n\n\nIf you use audience triggers, then GA4 logs an event whenever a user becomes part of that audience. This can increase (not set) even more if you choose the option to log an additional event when audience membership refreshes.  \nThis can happen because these audience creation events are not associated with other sessions.

        "selftext": "Hi!\n\n**Problem Context:**\n\nI'm setting up Google Analytics for my company which has (1) a public website and (2) a gated access dashboard for users. These two websites have different domains. As a user, I can click on a button on the public website ¬ª enter my login details ¬ª reach the dashboard. However, there are also other traffic sources for the dashboard, e.g. third party applications that will lead users to this dashboard.\n\n**Business Need:**\n\nThe top priority will be to see the analytics for *the public website only*.\n\nHowever, it would be great if we could also see:\n\n1. An aggregated analytics view for users across both (1) and (2), including the conversion funnel of users navigating from the public website to the account dashboard.\n2. Analytics for the *gated-access dashboard only*.\n\nHow would you recommend me to set up my Google Analytics? Based on my research, it seems like Google recommends for **one property + one data stream (for the public website) with cross-domain tracking enabled for the dashboard**. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to see the analytics for the dashboard only (e.g. acquisition, bounce; referring traffic aside from the public website) with this approach.\n\nAlternatively, I am considering **setting (1) and (2) as separate data streams under the same property**. But it seems like Google doesn‚Äôt advise having more than one web data stream. Also, if I were to configure cross-domain tracking, it seems like they need to have the same measurement ID, so I‚Äôm not sure how that works either. Any perspectives please?\n\n---\n\n**Update:**\n\nThanks for all the replies so far! As a quick follow up: We've just discovered that we may be unable to get cross-domain tracking to work, because from public website ¬ª user login ¬ª dashboard, the user login gate is shared across all teams in our organization and beyond our team's control. As such, we won't be able to get the \\_gl parameter to persist to the dashboard website.\n\nGiven this issue, should we still proceed with one data stream + cross domain tracking, or what alternative approach should we consider?",

Once the user successfully registers, the azure redirects the user to our domain and the session id = SESSION A continues to record. But during this re-direct process, azure strips away all the parameters and dropping the \\_gl parameter. At the end, the SESSION A is reported as a Direct Traffic in GA4 as it losses all the information during azure re-direct.\n\nWe addressed this issue with our google partner and even they couldn't help to find a solution on how to add the \\_gl parameter manually to the re-direct url.\n\nI get a reply saying the cross domain tracking will not work \"When the navigation is triggered by JavaScript as opposed to a direct response by user action\" (from google support doc)\n\nBecause of this issue, we couldn't see a complete picture of User conversion in the Funnel report and their acquisition channel.\n\nIf someone has a faced a similar situation, please share your thoughts here.

We‚Äôre trying to track the lifetime revenues per user and link that to our marketing efforts to better understand our ROI from paid channels.\n\n# The Challenges:\n\n1. **Sending Monthly Renewal Revenues to GA4:**\n   * Our billing platform sends webhooks when a user‚Äôs subscription renews each month.

If so, what‚Äôs the best method to do this? Can I use custom events or another approach?\n2. **Tracking Revenue Across Multiple Users in the Same Account:**\n   * In our SaaS product, one user typically creates the company account and then invites additional team members. All these users should ideally be linked to the same company account in GA4.\n   * Is there a way in GA4 to assign different users to a single company account? I was thinking about user groups or some other solution, but I‚Äôm not sure how to implement this effectively.\n\n# I know there're standalone solutions like Mixpanel for this, but that needs a lot of implementation as well. Would be great if this can be all implemented with GA4.\n\n  \nLooking forward to any of your thoughts.",

This week (3/18), I'm having the same conditions reported.

Sometimes you just have to do a bit of detective work to figure out what's actually happening.\n\nIf your GTM and GA4 setups aren't too complex, I'd start by searching for \"GA4 Event\" in your GTM container to find all your Google Analytics event tags. Then click into each tag and look for the event name. That's what you'll use to compare against what's showing up in GA4.\n\nOnce you have those event names, hop over to your GA4 admin panel and check the Events section. You should be able to match up the event names from GTM with what's actually firing in GA4.\n\nJust keep in mind that not every GA4 event has to use GTM. Some might be set up directly in GA4, others could be hard-coded into the website, and GA4 automatically fires several standard events that you won't see in GTM at all.\n\nThe Tag Assistant and GTM's debug/preview mode that others mentioned are definitely worth using too.\n\nIf you are taking over management of these the first thing I would do is create a naming scheme for GTM to help identify tags, triggers, and variables quickly.",

                "body": "1 & 2. Generally speaking, unless you need to both restrict access to data by market and monitor sampling, a single property is much easier to manage. There are other considerations too, like whether or not your reporting audiences will need to compare data across markets; and whether or not users will know GA4 well enough to filter data. It may not be a concern if each market site is fully contained in each subfolder, but if there's a \"shared\" experience (i.e., set of pages or interactions before the market pages), you would duplicate those events by the number of properties (and their associated traffic). I wouldn't invite the multiple property workflow unless you really have to.\n\nTo make reporting easier for people, you could create a suite of pre-filtered reports. Or, if you're not too worried about sampling, create Looker Studio dashboards for each using report-wide market-specific filters. Easy.\n\n3. Doing so is probably inevitable in the long run, but since it offers no immediate advantage over page path filtering, I'd think though it first. Will there ever be two markets with the same language, or vice versa? If so, you may need dimensions for each to distinguish them, and a new future solution might complicate historical reporting.\n\n4. I'd also (strongly) suggest coding it to the site via a custom dataLayer event that fires on every page, using GTM only to harvest the parameter data via dataLayer variables, add them to the event settings variable, and push the data to GA4. Why? Page path triggers/filters in GTM are delicate and can break silently if the URL changes and the trigger conditions aren't met, or you may want to develop more dimensions than market and be unable to target them in GTM. The coded dataLayer event push might seem daunting, but it's not usually difficult, and is far more scalable. The juice is almost definitely worth the squeeze.",

        "selftext": "UPDATE:  I got a teammate to try GTM preview/debug from a different computer and they also do not see any events in the debug.  I AM seeing some of the URLs I hit in realtime, but like 20-30 minutes later, and not 100 percent consistent.  Is lag in 'real time' stats a thing?  \n  \nI am trying to debug some missing custom events in GA4 (custom events are firing in GTM but not being reflected in GA4) but using GTM preview and debug mode in GA4, **I seem to be invisible.**  Also when I use incognito or another browser using an easily identifiable URL, my sessions do not seem to show up all the time in the real time overview or pages.  Is there any known common reason for this?  Some notes on what I have tried:\n\nVerified GTM container is firing GA4 and custom events as expected and sending to the right data stream\n\nVerified that the pages in question are tagged with GA4 according to GA4\n\nThe GA4 property is on an active website and is showing realistic user traffic and events for the most part.\n\nI've deactivated all data filters on the GA4 account\n\nEverything is set up to work properly and SEEMS to be working properly, yet I am constantly unable to verify anything through debug or real time view in GA4.  GTM preview tells me all events are firing as expected and sending to the right container but I should see them in debug or rt right?\n\nI will check in 24 hours to see if my test events and the uncommon urls I was hitting are populated in reporting, but I feel like I should not be a ghost on the site in real time... What's going on?",

Latency is unpredictable and GA4 will often not show any details of a specific event when drilling down into it, likely because of privacy restrictions (GA4 gets twitchy about thresholds because you might be able to identify the user that created the event).\n\nDebug view‚Ä¶ a few months back I forgot it was even a thing. I just don‚Äôt use it.\n\nWhat I do use is Chrome dev tools network tab, because if I see events going out to GA4 from that view, I‚Äôm signing off on a job well done.\n\nIf server-side GTM is involved, I‚Äôll maybe look at the outbound server hit from sGTM preview as a peace-of-mind measure, but generally I‚Äôm satisfied if the hit in Chrome network view is visibly reaching sGTM.",

I've also added these parameters and their corresponding values into the GA4 configuration tag. I did this two days ago. I also added in GA4 matching custom definitions.

        "author": "Middle-Heart2923",
        "id": "1lphb1i",
        "selftext": "Hey there! Looking for community input on our Google Analytics setup for a nonprofit. I've done some research but I'd love to run it by you all for any advice and thoughts. Thank you in advance!\n\n**Our Setup:**\n\n* Main web application (authenticated users) on maindomain.com\n   * Our web app can push custom user data to dataLayer\n* Login page on login.maindomain.com (separate codebase, legacy setup)\n* WordPress marketing site on marketingdomain.com (public/ no authentication)\n\n**Our Goals:**\n\n1. Marketing team needs a GA property for general usage analysis\n2. Data team needs a separate GA property with curated events for a BigQuery export\n3. Engineering team needs a testing property for new tags from our web application\n\n**What I‚Äôm thinking for setup:**\n\n* **GTM Containers (2):**\n   * Container A: Web application (main.domain.com) \n   * Container B: WordPress marketing site \n      * Also to be fed by login.maindomain.com (while I know that this flow is technically part of the user flow for the application use itself, I am thinking of including it with the Wordpress site‚Äôs GTM container since 1) the tags themselves will be similar in that these users are all unauthentificated and 2) I‚Äôd like to keep the Web application container as clean as possible, only being fed by the maindomain.com codebase if possible. I would love to know any thoughts here! I am probably missing some limitations that would arise in doing this.).\n* **GA Properties (3):**\n   * **Testing Property**:\n      * New tags from web app before promotion (and that promotion just means changing the destination of the tag‚Äôs data via a change to the tag‚Äôs measurement/property stream ID).\n   * **Marketing Property**:\n      * All functioning tags from both sites\n      * Enhanced Measurement ON\n      * cross-domain tracking domains list: maindomain.com and marketingdomain.com\n   * **BigQuery Property**:\n      * Curated events only\n      * Enhanced Measurement OFF\n      * cross-domain tracking domains list: maindomain.com and marketingdomain.com\n\n**Some questions:**\n\n1. Does this container and property division make sense? And, specifically any additional thoughts on how login.maindomain.com should be handled?\n2. For the BigQuery property, I'm planning to duplicate certain desired tags in the GTM containers and pointing them to my BigQuery Property. Is this the right approach?\n3. For cross-domain tracking, I read [here](https://www.analyticsmania.com/post/cross-domain-tracking-in-google-analytics-4/) that Google handles subdomains automatically now. I am reading this as that I do NOT need to add my subdomain (login.myapplicationdomain.com) to my list of configured domains in my tag settings for my property streams, is this correct? And, would I still need to make sure my GTM container code (for Container B) is included in login.myapplicationdomain.com‚Äôs code?\n\nAny feedback on this approach or things I'm missing? Thanks again!",

        "selftext": "**To conduct a proper analysis, I need to structure event fields in a very detailed way.** My site is highly multifunctional, with various categories and filters, so it‚Äôs crucial to capture the primary ID of each object to link the web data with our database (which contains hundreds of tables).\n\nFor example, for each event I must:\n\n* Distinguish the type of action (e.g., viewing a modal form, viewing a page, clicking).\n* Include the primary ID (if one exists).\n* Include a ‚Äúlog type‚Äù so I know which table or entity in the database the ID corresponds to.\n* Specify the type of page (to differentiate between routes leading to conversion or activation).\n* In certain cases, identify the type of web element (e.g., if one page type has multiple ways to perform an action).\n\n**Option A** is to configure all these events and parameters directly in Google Tag Manager (GTM), then export to BigQuery via GA4. But this approach requires complex JavaScript variables, extensive regex lists, and other tricky logic. It can become unwieldy, risk performance issues, and demand a lot of ongoing work.\n\n**Option B** is to track broader events by storing raw data (e.g., `click_url`, `click_element`, `page_location`, etc.), then export that to BigQuery and run a daily transformation script to reshape the raw data as needed. This strategy lets me keep the original data and store different entities in different tables (each with its own parameters), but it increases BigQuery usage and costs, and makes GA4 less useful for day-to-day analytics.\n\n**Question:** Which approach would you choose?

Also, dynamic Sort and Filter features can also be difficult to impossible to target in GTM (think iFrame); I'd definitely confirm those as well.\n\nIf you have developer resources, you might consider an Option C: code dataLayer events, then use GTM to configure dataLayer variables, tags, and triggers to grab that data and send it GA4/BigQuery. This is the workflow I've seen in every job, but most have been larger org/stores.\n\nHow I read it, any solution for what you're describing is going to require a fair amount initial and ongoing work in GTM.

If the purchase event is what's being fired via an event outside of GTM, it's most likely a timing issue.\n\nI would avoid doing it this way unless absolutely necessary. You can use custom GTM events to accomplish pretty much anything you'd do with gtag events, and assuming that you've structured the ecommerce data in the recommended way it's pretty trivial to reformat the events to send to GTM instead with minimal additional setup required (you can use \"Send ecommerce data\" instead of manually adding all the parameters).",

We have built out sending GA4 events on element/button clicks, pages loading and purchase events when receipt pages are loaded. So, we ask for clients' GA4 key, we load that into their site, and all these GA4 events we have built get sent directly to their GA4 account. \n\nWe also offer the option to load a GTM key into the clients' website if given to us. This gives them the option to tag stuff and create events that maybe we didn't build out with direct GA4 events mentioned above. They, of course, can load in script logic, etc. through GTM too. \n\nThat is why the option of loading in GTM and GA4 occurs. But, your comment about potential timing issues, the dataLayer being over written, etc. are great points that I can bring to the table to work on dis-allowing GTM + GA4 begin loaded together.",

That does make it more complicated if you can't be 100% sure if the client has a container. \n\nThough, given that container setup can be templated, it also presents you with a potential upsell if you can require them to have GTM. Create a template container where you use a constant variable to add the tag ID to each GA4 tag, and all you'll generally have to do for setup for a new client is export that template container, import it to a new container, and edit the constant with that client's tag ID.\n\nThere's also no concept of ownership in GTM, so it doesn't matter if you create the container and give them access. I would recommend going the GTM route if possible, as it'd make things cleaner and gives total control over tag timing.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend:\n\n* Only fire one GA4 config per page, either via GTM (my reco) or via an on-page gtag, but not both\n   * Any gtag events that try to fire before the config is loaded will most likely fail\n* Place GTM as high as possible in the head (but not before the gtag 'consent', 'default' call if you're implementing Google Consent Mode)\n* If you have to do anything GA4-related above GTM in the head, add this immediately before your GTM script in order to avoid overwriting the dataLayer (which the gtag also uses):\n   * <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || \\[\\]; </script> \n   * Note that you can just add that regardless with no downside",

Google calls this pixel a Google Tag, and it will look something like G-xxxxxx. Go to GTM and fire it on all pages, presumably like you did for Meta. \n\nFrom there,\n- for GA4 you can create events directly in GTM (no initial event configuration required within GA4, you just start building in GTM)\n- for GAds, you‚Äôll need to follow the conversion setup flow within GAds before you receive a conversion ID, conversion action, and conversion label. That information will need to be put in a tag in GTM (along with whatever triggering conditions apply).",

First, you set up events in GA4, then import them into Google Ads for conversion tracking. The Conversion Linker helps Google Ads track users across sessions and domains. Unlike Meta, Google doesn‚Äôt give you event codes you create triggers in GTM and use the GA4 Event Tag to send data. If GA4 feels complicated, Qwestify is a great alternative. It‚Äôs easier to use and gives you clear, cookie-less tracking.",

I was able to successfully set up the triggers for multiple buttons on a single page (not the homepage) and create a tag that appears to be sending the events to GA4.\n\nBut now I'm trying to figure out how to set up a trigger for a buttons on other pages, as well as hopefully one trigger for the main CTA in the top nav. Here are my questions:  \n  \n1. Do I need to set up a separate trigger (or even event tag) for every page? Or can I add a trigger fires from other pages to the same Trigger I used on the single page?\n\n2. If I add a trigger fire to the top nav button, will that fire when people click the button from any page, or do I need to do it separately for every page?\n\n3. Do I need a separate tag for button triggers for forms?\n\nApologies if some of this doesn't make sense...this all seemed pretty easy for setting up buttons on a single page but now I'm kind of lost and most of the YouTube videos I've found are for setting up the event for a single button.\n\n",

Without additional configuration of your event tag you will not be able to tell which elements caused the event to fire in GA4.\n\nYou really have two options here.\n\n- Option 1 (not recommended) -\n\nCreate an event to handle every single element that can be clicked on and have it fire off a ‚Äúclick element - all clicks‚Äù trigger.\n\nIn the event setup, create a parameter to send along with the event that will help you distinguish between different elements. An example might be the text of the element so you could create a parameter called ‚ÄúclickText‚Äù and send it along with the event using the inbuilt GTM variable [Click Text] as the value.\n\nYou will need to add clickText as a custom definition in the GA4 admin as well otherwise the parameter won‚Äôt be recorded with the event (even if it does show up in debug mode)\n\nI don‚Äôt recommend this method as it is a lot of extra work for you when reading reports to dive in to the event and look at the parameters to work out what was clicked on.\n\n- Option 2 (recommended) -\n\nCreate a unique event for each specific element you want to track using specific ‚Äúclick element - some clicks‚Äù triggers. You will need to configure triggers for each event to ensure they only trigger for the elements you want each event to fire for. You may need to use multiple variables for targeting such as click class, click url and click text.\n\nWith this approach you can then create plain English event names such as ‚ÄúButton - Contact‚Äù, ‚ÄúButton - Back to Top‚Äù, ‚ÄúButton - Click to Call‚Äù, etc. Now when you look at the events in GA4 you can tell from the event name what element was clicked.\n\nYou can go further too. Say you have multiple contact buttons on the site and most of the time you don‚Äôt care which contact button was clicked, just that a contact button was clicked. Then you could make an event that fires on all contact buttons and send along parameters with the event (as in option 1) which distinguish between them (note: If the only distinguishing feature between each button is the page it is on, you don‚Äôt need to do that as GA4 automatically captures the page any event is fired on). This means you can still very quickly see the amount of total contact button clicks while still being able to dig deeper when needed and find out which clicks happened on which contact buttons.\n\nI hope the above helps.\n\nEdit: Oh and to answer question number two, if your trigger doesn‚Äôt include a page URL in its conditions then that trigger will fire on any matching event no matter what page it is on (in case that wasn‚Äôt clear from my explanation).",

So I set up three tags/triggers in GTM to diagnose the issue. Each tag/trigger captures the name of the action (in event\\_action) and the link that the user clicked (in event\\_label). The first tag/trigger is on the initial link click, the second one tracks if the user clicks OK and the third one tracks if the user clicks Cancel. Theoretically, the total of OK and Cancel clicks should be close to the number of link clicks. If nothing else, logically, it should never be *more* since the user can't get to the OK and Cancel buttons without first clicking a link.\n\nBut looking at my data from yesterday, I show 57 instances of the initial link being clicked, 9 instances of the user clicking Cancel but **85 instances** of visitors clicking OK to proceed to the website.\n\nI'm stumped. How could I have more instances of an event that can't happen until the initial link is clicked.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts?",

To see the actual data you have to connect BigQuery.\n\nAnd to throw another wrench in GA4 explore reporting, I've been experiencing reports being sampled to hell. I just did one the other day, Explore reported 16 clicks on a particular button - BigQuery with the same exact filters reported over 600 clicks. Explore warned the sample size was less than 10% so I imagine that's the discrepancy. Granted, this is a site that gets a fairly large volume of traffic.\n\nUltimately, validate your tagging is working, especially across desktop and mobile, and the most common browsers.

May I ask which platform your website is built on? Most ecommerce platforms offer a direct integration with GA4 and/or GTM. Depending on the platform that you're using, you may be better off using the platform's native GA4 integration.\n2. Any particular reason why you want to create the event in GA4 instead of GTM?\n3. Do you have the GTM script added to your site anyway? I ask this question because I would still use Tag Assistant GTM preview to debug and test the solution we put in place\n\nIf I were to create this event in GA4, I would probably do it like this:\n\nevent name: order\\_button\\_clicks\n\nMatching conditions:\n\n* event\\_name **equals** click or gtm.linkClick\n* page\\_location **contains** (insert the specific URL where the order button is placed)\n* link\\_url contains (the URL that you land on after clicking the button)\n* link\\_text contains Order\n   * I wouldn't use link\\_text but if you need an extra matching condition to differentiate this event and another event.. you can use the CTA text here. CTA buttons are tested for performance all the time, especially important buttons like the one to place your order. It can be easy to forget that someone suggested last month to change it from Order to Order Now, as an example, and the event would stop working.\n\ndon't forget to test this using Tag Assistant - that will tell you what to do for the first matching condition, click or gtm.linkClick",

Implemented the gtag into my code;\n\n2. Created the `experience_impression` tag in GTM (Google Tag Manager) with the `exp_variant_string` parameter with a default value of '`template_variant`';\n\n3. Tested the newly created tag with GTA (Google Tag Assistant) and ensured it is firing:\n\n[GTA event trigger details](https://preview.redd.it/plf0z4olsy7e1.png?width=1724&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c4f8869fd24acafd8bad53f7d7953517eb3d6f2)\n\n4.

I cannot figure out how to pass the `exp_variant_string` programatically. I'm currently using JavaScript to send the parameters with the gtag.js\n\n[Current setup is wrapped in a fn that can create consistent names for different web pages I have based on wether user's assigned variant, as per the suggested format from the docs by Google for developers I provided above](https://preview.redd.it/q4i6ocacuy7e1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bf5e913d60ffc2fbfe3b12200d5a1b5987a6910)\n\nhowever, this does not seem to work. As you can see in the screenshot from GTM, the parameters are not being passed at all (or so I think) and I'm not even sure how to find them in GA4. I've even tried removing the default parameter, but then nothing shows up at all and I'm not sure why - I have to create a custom dimension matching this parameter in GA4? How?\n\n[Variables tab from GTA](https://preview.redd.it/muadhu9puy7e1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a52076cc3f730b0129e8317d5876ce4b1a1a97)\n\nb. How can I create a GA4 audience that checks for the `exp_variant_string` parameter's value rather than an event? I basically want to use eventName.parameterValue as a filter for my audience, where eventName is `experience_impression` `and parameterValue is experience_impression`'s `exp_variant_string`.\n\n\n\nI might have missed or misunderstood some things so sorry in advance, but I could not find any straight-forward guide on how to set this up. If there's any guides you can share, that'd also be super handy!\n\nThank you in advance.",

When debugging with the Tag Assistant, you have to check the Data Layer tab and get the name of the parameter from there (this way you're also testing and ensuring that it is being sent).\n\nAfter doing this, when creating the tag in GTM, simply go to parameters, add that same variable name to the parameter, and set the variable you've just created as the value to be stored with that parameter. Next time you're testing with the Tag Assistant and your tag fires, you should be able to confirm the data is transmitted properly by checking 'see as values' instead of seeing the variable name.\n\nYou've made sure through Tag Assistant testing that the events are properly sent - now in GA4.

                "body": "Great question - and for supportiveness, one many struggle with, so you‚Äôre not alone here. \n\nYes, in theory, GA4 should automatically collect, store, and report Campaign (and other UTMs) natively without you needing to explicitly pass them in the config or event tags. However, in practice this doesn‚Äôt always work the way we want, depending on how your users flow, whether your site is a single page app, how you are utilizing the UTMs, etc. For example, if a user clicks on a Google ad and lands on the site, then clicks an on-site banner that has a UTM campaign on it that directs the user to a different page on the same hostname, the UTM will appear in the navigation bar, however, this session won‚Äôt be attributed to the banner in reporting. This is because the session was attributed to the Google ad. \n\nCurious how others deal with this, but there are at least a few ways to try and address this that I can think of.\n\n1. Use a different UTM. Campaign is a native UTM that gets treated differently. If it‚Äôs easy to use a unique one, then you can pass it in the config tag and report on it separately.\n\n2. Include this in both the config tag AND event tags where you specifically want this data included. This will ensure it‚Äôs always present where you expect it to be. If you only rely on the config tag, there are scenarios where events can fire out of order, and the config param could be populated as blank or (not set). Including your param in both should help minimize those scenarios. Adding these to all event tags gets time consuming, so take a look at the event tag setting variables. You can create them once & apply to all event tags. Just make sure you only include event params you are OK being applied to all events if you do that.\n\n3. Of course there‚Äôs the obligatory ‚Äújust use big query‚Äù, but that‚Äôs becoming a catch-all phrase on this sub for any issue with GA4, and often lacks specificity on how exactly to use BQ to solve the problem. \n\n4. Don‚Äôt rely on GTM debug view for anything ever. It regularly shows data being collected that is not going to be available in reporting. Sounds like you‚Äôre reviewing network calls. That‚Äôs the correct way to ensure data capture & transmission.",

If you have a custom event with the name page\\_view, then every time that event is triggered, Google will read it as a second view of the same page that GA4 has already counted. The DOUBLES the page view, session, and user count metrics. \n\nI don't see a way to use the Google Tag tag in GTM with stock page\\_view disabled, so I don't see a way to make a custom Event with name = page\\_view without this double counting. \n\nWe made this mistake because we misunderstood the event name parameter. We thought we were adding our custom dimensions to an existing event named page\\_view; no, we were added a second page\\_view with custom dimensions. Instead, the custom dimensions event can be named anything. The name does not matter, the custom dimensions are added to the session anyway, because custom event parameters are always added to the current session, regardless of event name.",

        "selftext": "Hi. \n\nI have recently started running Google Ads for our store (which is in Shopify -- Not S. Plus).\n\n\n\nUp until now we've only done Facebook ads. So I'm starting with a small ads campaign.\n\n\n\nWe've been running GA4 tag in Shopify, which I believe I set up correctly even before the UA tag was deprecated. So I believe our Analytics data is correct.\n\n\n\nI was trying to use GTM, which looks like it's causing multiple fires of events. But I think I have multiple fires in addition to GTM. I'm seeing way more events fired than I should be seeing for both the Google Ads and the other traffic sources.\n\n\n\nFor example, when I look at Analytics --> Life cycle--> Engagement --> Events I see:\n\nEvent count: 44,745 (100% of total)\n\nTotal users: 3,838 (100% of total) -- this might be right. But in Google Ads this number is way higher.\n\nEvent count per active user: 11.79 (Avg 0%)\n\nTotal revenue: $947.10 (100% of total) -- I confirmed this is correct between Shopify and Google Analytics.\n\nFor traffic we get high engagement and multiple page views on Organic traffic to the store as showing in Analytics.\n\n\n\nThe event tag that I think is from GTM is ads\\_conversion\\_Shopping\\_Cart\\_1 has 10x the fires than the purchase event shows.\n\n\n\nBut before I installed GTM I wasn't getting any conversion reporting. \n\n\n\nI think I need to remove GTM and start over. At this point I don't mind that I will lose data. I want to build a set up that will use Google Ads, GTM, and Google Analytics that will fire right and once confirmed we can scale.\n\n\n\nCan anyone comment on how to proceed? Thanks.",

I would agree then on re-setting up your tracking here.  \n  \nUsually, when you are using the Shopify-GA4 native integration, there is no more need to use Google Tag Manager as this might only cause double counting depending on the tags set up within your GTM. I assume you are using GTM for your Google Ads conversion tracking on Shopify? If yes, then why not do away with GTM and just use imported conversions from GA4 to Google Ads and then use those for reporting and optimization goals? This is something you can start off with and see if it works for you.",

Any and all advice is appreciated.  \nOne of my clients is a franchise; all of the locations/traffic is being sent to one website. Because of this, there is one GA4 account that is used to keep up with everything and we typically segment traffic per campaign using UTMs.\n\nThe client is very keen on being able to attribute what purchases are coming from what advertising channels. They recently switched booking platforms and now utilize MBO with a custom solution widget. I set up cross domain tracking in GA4 between the website and the booking URL., but now it seems as thought the GLID is being stripped halfway through the booking so it's not attributing to a campaign via UTM.\n\n  \n¬†I've worked with the dev team in getting the dataLayer set up to send over everything I need to GA4 from each purchase - Item Name, Price, and Quantity. In GA4 I'm able to see all of the purchases coming in, but, since all locations share the same website and GA4, I'm unable to see what purchases are coming from which advertising channels or to which location.\n\n  \nI worked with the dev team again and created individual GA4 properties for each of the booking sites (each location has their own). I then added the GA4 for the original site as a second data stream to some of the properties to test how things would flow through. It seems to be working, and it should give me what I'm needing. However, I feel as though there is a better/easier way for this to be done. If anyone has any insight or feedback I'd greatly appreciate hearing it.",

With no banner, they're still taking a risk.\n\nThat's because banners use Consent Mode, which requires the default consent initialization tag from Google Tag Manager to fire BEFORE anything on the screen is drawn.   (Google even created a new tag to allow this to happen).\n\nBy the time the directly placed GTM script is run, Drupal is well under way with the screen.  That means that the default tag fires out of order, and either Google will think that you didn't get consent from your users during this time to analyze their data (most probable), or it overwrites consent that the user previously gave (less probable).   As a result, analytics data is partially or totally lost.\n\nThis timing problem is why the Drupal community created the GTM module: it is built to allow the initialization tags to fire at the right times.   But caution with the GTM module because some past versions contained some terrible bugs which have caused significant damages in lost data and lost time trying to diagnose the problem.   (We know because it happened to us)\n\nDon't be scared, just make sure you perform all updates and understand what you're installing and you'll be fine.",

        "selftext": "I will be so grateful for anyone that can help with this issue. Below is a more detailed description of the problem I am having.\n\nI am trying to set up an RFI form submission event. I already have a form\\_submit event in GTM that is being pushed to GA4 for all form submissions on my site. Now I am setting up a separate event specifically for RFI form submissions that I plan to mark as a conversion in GA4. \r  \n\r  \nI have created a custom event in GA4 that fires when event name equals form\\_submit and the form\\_id equals the id of my RFI form. I then tested it using the preview mode in GTM and looked for the new event to fire in the debug mode of GA4. Not only did the new event not show up in GA4 debug, the generic form\\_submit event did not show up either. \r  \n\r  \nI can't fathom why the form\\_submit event was not sent to GA4 since the tag fired perfectly fine looking on the GTM side. The form\\_submit event has been working for all other form submissions that I have tested before and since, but it will not send to GA4 for this RFI form for some reason.\r  \n\r  \nI tried recreating the RFI form submission custom event from GA4 in GTM and set it up to send to GA4 to see if it would work that way, or if I could at least see what the issue was. But, once again, this tag fired perfectly fine in GTM but is not showing up in GA4 debug mode.\r  \n\r  \nI've double checked that the I am using the correct GA4 container in the GTM tags and that the event names match up and haven't found any issues. Has anyone else encountered an issue like this, or does anyone have any ideas on what I might be doing wrong? I'm fully prepared for this to be something simple and small that I have overlooked, but I've been searching for a long time and I can't fathom why this event won't show in GA4.",

It's a good point to check that more closely though. I will double check that the event is set up the exact same way as the corresponding event in UA and let them both run for a full day and compare the numbers.",

I'm not sure what needs amending or removing. \n\nThey have a Google Analytics global site tag that has a UA code on their website. Their UA analytics is connected to their GA4 and is showing all their events correctly. \n\nThey also have a GTM account, but it's not installed on their site, and have one legacy UA tag that is tracking one of their key events in GA4. \n\nSo, I was wondering do I need to replace the UA global site tag code with the GA4 version? Does the GTM code need to be added to their site? And does the UA legacy tag need to be replaced with a GA4 event tag?  \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, thanks. ",

        "selftext": "Would love some help with some ongoing issues I'm having on GA4. Long story short:\n\n1. I didn't really have anything to do with GA/any experience using it until the end of 2023, after the migration to GA4 from UA. My background is as a content writer but hey, we're a small scrappy startup, so sometimes I get thrown a wild card here and there. \n2. I have been asked to confirm that conversions are being tracked correctly in GA4 - for historical data, so we know what we're tracking on an ongoing basis is correct.\n3. My company's GA setup was created years ago, well before my time, with no documentation.\n4. I'm seeing what appears to be multiple versions of different tags/containers firing on different sites, and can't figure out what feeds into what. This is arguably the most confusing thing for me.\n5. From what I understand, the trigger for a specific conversion event (the most important one for me) actually occurs server-side - so I guess we're using both GTM/GA4 as well as some kind of server-side implementation.\n6. There's a hell of a lot of data that shows up as (none) or (unassigned) or other tags that don't lead anywhere. Exploring any of this via the user view, and it doesn't look like there's much in each individual user profile to connect the dots.\n7. We also track customer data on GA4, for some reason (i.e. we track peoples' actions in our web app's backend, as well as behavior on the marketing site)\n8. There's all sorts of random tags and old data left around the system and on our website and I have no idea how to decipher them. I've tried dozens of approaches and still get the same numbers which are missing lots of data/fields with seemingly no pattern.\n9. We also have some custom events/dimensions set up, but there's no indication of what makes them trigger.\n10. If I can prove that the missing data is gone forever as it was never set up, and we need to start from scratch going forwards, that's completely fine. I just don't understand how I can be sure one way or the other.\n\nBasically, all I want to know is how I can come up with a concrete number for conversions that follow this journey:\n\n1st entry to our site via organic search, with details on the referring URL i.e. google > landing page is anything on our standard domain > they trigger the conversion event. As far as I know, the conversion event can only be triggered on one page on the site, so once we know where it started, we're fine. It's just the directly attributable journey from organic search that seems impossible. Half the data (source/medium/hostname etc) seems to be missing from people who triggered the record.\n\nWould appreciate any help here - I'm pulling my hair out over this. Suggested to the team starting from scratch with Matomo, but they don't want to put 2x JS tags on the site to avoid slowing it down, and also would rather harness a free existing solution than convert to something paid, which makes sense from a business perspective.\n\nAnything pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.",

Cleaning up & mapping your tags (documenting what is being tracked) is priority 1. \n\nCheck to see if the same GA4 property tag is implemented via GTM and hardcoded. If a migration happened, make sure they didn‚Äôt duplicate a property tag.\n\nServer side and client side tagging as a combo is very common. Some tracking can only be done client-side. It‚Äôs typical for 3rd party tags (I.e Google, FB, Bing, Floodlight, etc.) and DB driven events like a purchase to have server-side. \n\nLook for cross-domain tracking. If there‚Äôs multiple containers, there are probably multiple GA4 properties, but again, if a migration happened with no documentation, check to see if any of those are empty. If I were to track multiple domains today, I‚Äôd do so with a single container & cross-domain tracking. Some vendors I‚Äôve had requested their own GTM container to be installed, but that‚Äôs rare and weird.\n\nCustom dimensions should be within your event and config tags in GTM. Check there to see what parameters are being passed to GA, then you‚Äôll have an idea of what triggers them (or is supposed to trigger them).\n\nYou may go into tag manager and look for unused tags (tags with no triggers), unused variables (variables that are not used in any tags), and unused triggers (triggers not used in any tags). If you find any of these, they should be safe to delete or ignore. It can be helpful to label these as ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù in the naming convention.\n\nOnce this stuff has been done, follow the same path you‚Äôre looking to track - Google > landing page > conversion event. While doing so, have the debug tool running & check the params that are passing each step of the way. The first pageview event should have a session source/medium. You can also check chrome dev tools and look for ‚Äúcollect‚Äù. This JS will show what‚Äôs passing to GA from your session. I‚Äôve had instances where everything looked fine in the debug tool, but data was not passing in the collect statement.",

        "id": "17q5xbd",
        "selftext": "I am using GTM on our Product Cart website to fire a GA4 event tag called Product Cart Purchase, with the event name `purchase_from_cart`. When users complete a purchase, they are redirected to a page on the site with `/designer-download` in the URL path, and the query string contains all the info I need for the ecommerce analysis.  Instead of using the data layer, I have defined custom variables using the URL query string and composed a custom Javascript variable called `ecommerce_object` .\n\nIn the Ecommerce configuration of this tag, I have `Send Ecommerce Data` checked, with the `Data source` as `Custom Object`, `Ecommerce Object` is the value of the `{{ecommerce_object}}`, and the `ecommerce_object` value is generated like this:\n\n    function() {\n        return {\n            transaction_id: {{transaction_id}},\n            value: {{signup_revenue}},\n            currency: \"USD\",\n            items: [\n                {\n                item_id: {{product_id}},\n                item_name: {{item_name}},\n                currency: \"USD\",\n                price: {{signup_revenue}}\n                }\n            ]\n        };\n    }\n\nThe values `{{transaction_id}}`, `{{signup_revenue}}`, `{{product_id}}` are derived from the query parameters, and `{{item_name}}` is derived from another Javascript custom variable translating the `{{product_id}}` to a string naming the product.  But when I look at the Monetization: Ecommerce Purchase report in Google Analytics, it has no data.\n\nHere's what I've tried:\n\n* GTM preview: Verifies that the tag is firing at the appropriate time and that the parameter values are populated correctly, including the \\`ecommerce\\_object\\`\n* GA4 debug view: Shows the \\`product\\_cart\\_purchase\\` event firing with the parameter values intact.\n* My ecommerce object has the minimum required data for ecommerce analysis: transaction id, value, currency, array of item objects, and each item object has product id, item name and price.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nPlease and thank you.",

Analytics just fine and when I go into data streams for web it says that we've had traffic over the past 48 hours \"Data collection is active in the past 48 hours.\"  I can even see from the realtime report that analytics is registering the default events.\n\nGreat!\n\nHowever when I click into Configuration of the same data stream I get an orange error message telling me that my google tag is not communicating with my Analytics destination. \n\nI'm using Bigcommerce and the Instructions then say to copy my tag ID and paste it into the Google Analytics 4 integration. I do it and then nothing.\n\nI realize the property didn't have a Google Tag account so I go and create one and create a new tag with the GA4 Configuration type set to fire on all pages.\n\nWhen I preview the tag using Tag Assistant it is able to connect but does not find the GTM code. \n\nI've double checked that the measurement ID for that I used is in fact the same one from my GA property.  \n\nWhat am I missing!! \n\nI'm far from an expert but have done this a bunch of times (never with BigCommerce) and have never had such a problem getting my GTM to talk to G Analytics. \n\nHelp,\n\nMe\n\n&#x200B;",

Addressing them both may have solved things. First, both GA4 and GTM code were embedded in the site, so things were being double-counted. Also, the RegEx code in the trigger would sometimes allow the trigger to fire, but sometimes it wouldn't. I decided to just remove it. I may get additional, unintended counts of thank-you page conversions, but from what I can tell, there just isn't a super-predictable way of tracking form submissions that will fire consistently. If I'm wrong, I'd love to know something that works all the time! For now, I'm going with what I've got, and I'll tweak when GA4 presents new / better options.\n\n&#x200B;",

Our web developer suggested using the \"Initialization - All pages\" trigger because he said they've seen numerous issues with the \"Page View\" trigger since GA4 no longer uses pageview events like UA did. I'm going to try switching the trigger to see if that fixes the problem, but I'm concerned about creating other issues if using \"Page View - All pages\" has been a problem for other people.\n\nThank you!\n\n\\[1\\] [https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9442095?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9442095?hl=en) ",

                "body": "It sounds like you're experiencing issues with tracking sessions and pageviews in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) through Google Tag Manager (GTM). Let's address your concerns step by step:\n\n**Session Not Immediately Appearing in Realtime Reports:** It's not uncommon for sessions to take a short while (a few minutes) to appear in the realtime reports of GA4. However, if there's a significant delay or if sessions don't appear at all without navigating to another page, it could indicate an issue with your implementation.\n\n**Cookie Consent Banner:** Since you mentioned you accepted the cookie consent banner terms long ago, it's unlikely that this is causing the issue. Consent preferences are usually stored in cookies, and if you've already given consent, it should not affect the immediate session tracking.\n\n**GA4 Configuration in GTM:** The \"Initialization - All Pages\" trigger is the recommended trigger type for initializing the GA4 configuration on all pages of your website. This trigger ensures that the GA4 tracking code is consistently executed across your site. The \"Page View - All Pages\" trigger might still work, but using \"Initialization - All Pages\" is the recommended and more reliable approach for GA4.\n\n**Discrepancy in Google Documentation:** Discrepancies in documentation can sometimes occur due to updates, changes, or different use cases. Using the \"Initialization - All Pages\" trigger is the correct approach for GA4. Since you're encountering issues with sessions not being immediately tracked, it's worth trying the \"Page View - All Pages\" trigger to see if it resolves the issue, but do keep in mind that it might not be the ideal solution.\n\nTo troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n**Check Tag Configuration:** Ensure that your GA4 tag configuration in GTM is correct. Double-check your GA4 Measurement ID and other settings.\n\n**Test in Different Browsers:** Test the behavior across different browsers to see if the issue is specific to a particular browser.\n\n**Check for JavaScript Errors:** Use your browser's developer tools to check for any JavaScript errors that might be interfering with the GA4 tracking code.\n\n**Review GTM Preview:** Use GTM's preview mode to see if the GA4 tag is firing correctly and if there are any issues reported.\n\n**Session Timeout:** GA4 has a session timeout period. If a user lands on your site, performs no actions, and leaves, it might not trigger a session if the session timeout is not reached.\n\n**Page Load Time:** If your landing page has a very short load time and a user leaves quickly, the session might not be tracked. GA4 requires a minimum amount of time for a session to be counted.\n\n**Cache Issues:** Cached versions of your site might not trigger the GA4 tag. Clear your browser cache and test again.\n\n**Check Network Requests:** In your browser's developer tools, monitor the network requests to see if the GA4 tracking request is being sent when you land on the page.\n\nIf switching to the \"Page View - All Pages\" trigger resolves the issue, it might indicate a specific behavior of your site or a potential bug in GA4's current implementation. However, it's always a good idea to follow the recommended practices whenever possible.",

        "selftext": "\n\n\n\nFrom what I know, GTM‚Äôs <head> snippet is the main snippet to track websites users. The <body> snippet is only there as a backup to track users that do not load Javascript on their browser, which to my understanding almost everyone‚Äôs browser loads JS. The body snippet can help in that case, but other than that it‚Äôs not actually necessary. Please correct me if I‚Äôm mistaken. \n\nThe reason why I‚Äôm asking whether I can leave out the <body> script is because I‚Äôve been getting a lot of pageviews with the url as gtm-msr.appspot.com on my analytics tools, and it‚Äôs messing up my analytics. Looking at the user screen recording, it shows my website even though these urls are gtm-msr.appspot.com. That URL is Google‚Äôs URL to load a frame over my website for browsers that don‚Äôt support JS, which is what the <body> snippet is for. Basically these are bots landing on my website and leaving almost immediately, driving up numbers I don‚Äôt want to track for a URL that isn‚Äôt mine. \n\nThis is affecting my analytics tools, and website recording tools, my ads tools, etc etc. I can add a line of code for every tag saying to only load when its my website‚Äôs URL and not gtm-msr.appspot.com. But this is not ideal because a lot of my tags on GTM use templates so I can‚Äôt edit the HTML. \n\nSo I was thinking, if only bots are using the <body> snippet to load GTM, and it‚Äôs messing up my data, and I don‚Äôt care about bots; can I just leave out the <body> GTM snippet from my website? \n\n- Would this cause any problems that I‚Äôm not aware of?\n- Is there anything else that I need to consider?\n- Are there any alternative to this?",

UA offered some features to handle this, but these are not yet available in GA4. The solution I found was to modify the referrer in GTM, before the hit is sent to GA4. It appears to be working fine.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n**In Google Tag Manager**\n\n1. Create a new User-Defined Variable, and select JavaScript Variable as type\n2. Paste in the code below into the field and save it\n3. On your GA4 tags, add the following under 'Fields to Set': page\\_referrer\n4. Set the value of page\\_referrer to the JavaScript variable you created before\n\nThe code I created:\n\n    function(){\n      var referrer_hostname = new URL(document.referrer).hostname;\n      var facebook_arr      = [\n        'm.facebook.com',\n        'mobile.facebook.com',\n        'l.facebook.com',\n        'lm.facebook.com',\n        'web.facebook.com',\n        'touch.facebook.com'\n      ];\n      \n      if(facebook_arr.includes(referrer_hostname)){\n        return 'https://www.facebook.com/';\n      } else {\n        return document.referrer;\n      }\n    }\n\nIt works great.

We are currently using the older GA (Universal Analytics) to measure web statistics.\n\nWe have implemented the gtag.js from the UA property. I tried and created a GA4 property and it confused me when I am about to install the code. It says:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Don‚Äôt add more than one Google tag to each page. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to remove the old gtag.js now because my team still relies on it to count output, and we have our ad account linked to the older GA. But without the new code, GA4 isn't collecting data...So what do I do, will Google Tag Manager Solve this contradiction? Thanks ahead for any advice!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis one's been a pain for a few days, and I'm hoping to get a little help! We are running a WordPress site, have set up a GA4 account, got our \"Measurement ID\" of the form G-XABCDEFGHI, embedded the recommended script in the WordPress header php:\n\n`<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) --> <script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XABCDEFGHI\"></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'G-XABCDEFGHI'); </script>`\n\nWe can observe this script is in the page DOM on every page of the site (browser developer tools).\n\nOur marketing company is forming URLs as follows (actual website redacted, and specific UTM values also redacted and replaced with \"test\" or \"testing\").\n\n`https://our-domain.co.uk/?utm_source=testing&utm_medium=testing&utm_campaign=test&utm_content=2023-09-09`\n\nWe can observe an HTTP POST to `https://region1.google-analytics.com/g/collect`: (again most codes/numbers etc. are redacted as I'm unsure which could identify my GA account!!\n\n`https://region1.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-XABCDEFGHI&gtm=13tr5367&_p=163425986&cid=1111111111.1694258684&ul=en-gb&sr=3440x1440&uaa=x86&uab=64&uafvl=Chromium%3B116.0.5845.180%7CNot)A%253BBrand%3B24.0.0.0%7CGoogle%2520Chrome%3B116.0.5845.180&uamb=0&uam=&uap=Windows&uapv=10.0.0&uaw=0&_s=1&sid=1111111111&sct=1&seg=1&dl=https%3A%2F%2Four-domain.co.uk%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtesting%26utm_medium%3Dtesting%26utm_campaign%3Dtest%26utm_content%3D2023-09-09&dt=our_web_title_appears_here&en=page_view&_ee=1`\n\nWe are simply not seeing this traffic being recorded in GA4. Neither in \"real-time\" nor in reports. There have been some intermittent captures, when we've tested from our own office. The web logs indicate many visitors (hundreds) but GA rarely captures more than a dozen landings in a day.\n\nIn our own HTTP/SSL web logs, we can see plenty of people landing on our site with UTM codes in their landing URLS.\n\nWe (currently) do not have a CSP, I read that having one (specifically an out-of-date one) could cause issues with google \"regions\" in respect of GDPR. But I don't think the issue is here as we're currently running without a CSP.\n\nSometimes the marketing company uses a utm\\_campaign wth an encoded space (appears as a '+' plus in the URL) - when this happens our site issues 301 redirect, which turns the '+' into an HTTP encoded '%20', the user/browser follows the redirect and we can see them land again, UTM parameters still intact, receive a 200 and some page content etc.\n\nWe turned off all GA4 filters, in case the 301 counted as \"internal traffic\", but I don't think that's it either, since several of the campaigns haven't featured the '+', so have gone straight to HTTP:200.\n\nWe've checked and triple-checked the Measurement ID in GA, in GTM and in the embedded script. GTM is definitely configured to \"pass\" our measurement ID to our GA4 \"property\".\n\nI'd gratefully appreciate any more thoughts on what we might investigate, and apologise for a lengthy post!\n\nMany thanks,\n\nclumsy.....",

At least that's what I've been told by a marketing agency.\n\nSo my question is twofold:\n\n1. Is this actually a common thing? Has anyone else experienced the same problem? (Google Signals not working with server-side GA4)\n2. How should I actually implement the double tracking? I mean I can simply duplicate the GA4 configuration tag and all GA4 event tags, and have one set of tags send to my tagging server and the other set of tags send directly to GA4, but this just feels so bad and cumbersome... Maybe I'm missing something and there are better ways to do this?",

You could use a single property and even use the same stream measurement ID to receive data ... presumably with a custom dimension indicating where the data came from.\n\nI think I'd still just keep it entirely separated.\n\n~~The \"trick\" here may be to go ahead and have two GA4 config tags, but let's assume you already have your server-side config tag, you would then use tag sequencing on that tag to fire the web GA4 config tag either before or after the server-side GA4 config tag.~~\n\n~~What I'd be careful to test is that you get consistent results and that any fields and/or user properties are being sent correctly.~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\* I'm going to test this, because now I'm curious.\n\nSecond Edit: I'm talking out out my backside.

My question is if there's any downside to having both tracking in GTM and Enhanced measurement.\n\nIf I have Enhanced measurement recording, and then set up my tracking in GTM alongside it but give the events different names, would that cause a problem?",

        "author": "TC-marketing",
        "id": "y28x69",
        "selftext": "I'm working on transitioning my global company's site to GA4 and I'm not sure what the best approach is for the setup. I'm considering 2 approaches described below. If anyone else has had to set up GA4 for multiple countries (or maybe multiple lines of business, departments, something else similar) that all share a domain, I'd love to hear what setup you went with and how it's working out.\n\nThe company operates in several countries, and every country is on our domain with separate subdirectories by locale, e.g. /en-US/. Historically, the different countries were on separate domains (.com, .ca, .co.uk etc.), so today we have a separate UA property and GTM container for every country.\n\nFor GA4, I want to have every country's data flowing into one GA4 property. That seems like the cleanest option given the data stream setup GA4 uses and the ability to create unique reports in explore, so the different countries can see their own data.\n\nBut for GTM, I'm split between:\n\n1. **Merge every country into one GTM container.**\n   1. Downsides:\n      1. Each country's individual tags would need to have the firing triggers filtered to only apply to their locale, e.g. pages with URL containing /en-US/ vs. all pages. (This means modifying all existing tags and risk of data corruption if the teams don't consistently set the triggers correctly.)\n      2. The one GTM container will have a ton of tags in it worked on by different teams. It could make it harder for people to find their own tags (e.g. if the UK and US team each have 5 specific Meta pixel tags) and with more people working in there, it could cause mixups with version publishing.\n   2. Benefits:\n      1. There's a single GA4 implementation in GTM that applies to every single country's data. The main implementation tag as well as ecommerce event tags, variables, etc., and custom events that multiple countries would like to measure, are only created once.\n2. **Maintain separate GTM containers by country.** Create a GA4 implementation tag in each country's container that sends data to the same global GA4 property/measurement ID.\n   1. Downsides:\n      1. All of the GA4 events (and component parts like variables and triggers) need to be created in duplicate for every country's container.\n      2. There will be several GTM containers implemented on various sections of the site (though no individual page should have more than one GTM container) and several GA4 implementations sending data into the same property. **Is this possible? Is it advisable? Might it cause load time issues or data discrepancies in GA4?**\n   2. Benefits:\n      1. The different teams in each country can work and publish in their own containers without interfering with anyone else's tags. Each country can easily find the tags that belong to them.\n      2. The tags in each individual country container can continue to use \"all pages\" triggers, since that container ID will be implemented only on the pages within a given locale (like /en-US/) rather than across all pages on our domain.\n\nThanks in advance for any input!",

Our site is very large across 20 subdomains that have very different tracking needs, so one container holds events that are specific to the subdomain and the other container is a container that fires page view tag and any other global events like video tracking and pixels.

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nWorking on an upcoming feature that will use a lightbox for conversions that require a form submission. Essentially, the conversion requires a user account, but the CTA is available whether the user is signed in or out. If signed in, there's no form - the user just clicks the CTA and it converts. If signed out, today, the user is taken to a second page to either sign in or sign up, and after successfully completing that, they are returned to the original page with the conversion completed. What we're developing is a lightbox to contain the sign up/sign in form to see if it improves conversion for signed-out users to keep them on the same page. I'd like to set up event tracking to measure interactions and conversions that include the lightbox user journey.\n\nWith the current user flow, there is a standalone URL that records the user's visit to the form since it's on a separate page. Is there a best practice when developing a lightbox that will make it easier to track (ie create an event tag and trigger) when a user lands on/interacts with the lightbox? \n\nWould appreciate any insights or being pointed towards resources that may help. TIA!",

If you consider the traffic across all three subdomains to be one big group (i.e. maybe you need combined traffic for advertising audience purposes), you could make one GTM container, put it on all three subdomains, and collect everything into one GA4 account. If you need to track sessions and users that hop between the three sites, turn on cross-domain tracking to pass the cookies and UserIDs between them. If you do it this way, you can toggle between website analytics in GA4 by building comparisons, segments, and/or filters using the hostname dimension.\n\nIf you want to see traffic completely independently in three separate GA4 properties, you should probably create three different GTM containers. Cross domain measurement wouldn't apply in this case. That only applies to different sites that have the same data stream. I can understand the desire to only have one GTM container, i.e. less tags to manage if all three sites process the same types of events. But it's best to maintain them separately. You MIGHT be able to do what you're describing with one GTM container and 3 separate GA4 properties if you do some funky stuff with the GA4 measurement ID being set by a variable. In that case, you'd have to shove the actual measurement ID into the datalayer on each site, probably before you load the GTM container, grab the dataLayer variable with a custom GTM variable, and spit that into your GA4 tags. This should work, in theory, to create a dynamic kind of GTM tag, but I wouldn't do it. That type of infrastructure feels too fragile to me. I know it's a pain to maintain separate GTM containers, but it gives you more control. You can use the import/export tool to speed up the process of deploying changes across your containers. Just make sure to double check your tags after importing to make sure they're routed to the right GA4 property.\n\nHope this helps a little. Good luck!",

Your other criteria seem pretty specific so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it misfiring.\n\nEDIT: just throwing this out there, but remember that when you send back a dynamic variable ( such as {{Click ID}} ) that it will be sending back any variation of that variable that GTM picks up based on what gets past the trigger. You may flood your GA Event Label dimension with a bunch of random Click IDs. If your trigger only allows the tag to send back relatively clean data you may be okay, but just something to keep in mind in order to optimize what data you have in your GA account.",

The site is built with Elementor and I'm using Google Sitekit.\n\nWhen I went to GA4 a few days ago I could see activity in debug view and real time, however now I can't and I have no idea why. I have the GA4 config tag firing on all pages and it has the field {{Debug Mode}} set to \"true\".\n\nIs sitekit a bit shit? I noticed a lot of people got JSON errors earlier this week but it was resolved. While that was happening I uninstalled it and figured out how to add the GTM code straight into the site (Elementor has a nice custom code feature specifically for snippets) but I kinda like having the sitekit dashboard (even though I have no traffic yet) so I reverted to it once they resolved the issue (I did remove the snippets I added manually prior).\n\nI did the \"view page source\" thing and see snippets for analytics and GTM, but that's about as far as my expertise goes. I've also got the internal and developer traffic filters active.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nThanks!",

You can save this and create another one for your staging site.

As u/sharathonthemove pointed out, this will cause duplicate hits to be sent.  \n\n\nIf you want, you can add the GA code to the GTM container, but then you'd have to remove it from the site and only deploy it via the GTM container. You may want to deploy the GA code to the GTM container as this will give you more flexibility over modifying the tracking as many modifications, which would otherwise require developer involvement, can be managed via GTM.  \n\n\nYou could, however, leave the GA code on the site and only use the GTM container for adding other tags, such as Facebook or adwords tags. Remember that the GTM container is just a box, it does nothing unless you add things to it.  \n\n\n2. This sounds more tricky and I'd be wary of fiddling around with the production version of the container if you're not so experienced (no offense intended). Firstly, get familiar with the preview pane of GTM and how container versions can be tested. You say you added a new tag to GTM to try and tag the home page, but it sounds to me that you should take a look at the existing tags and figure out why it's not firing on that particular page. If you have multiple GA tags on the site then it sound like there could be risk of duplicate hits being sent. I recommend, as a first step, checking to make sure that all the GA instances that are deployed are different properties i.e. different UA ids. Otherwise you will be sending duplicate hits and breaking your data.",

Now we have had a couple however the forms are usually on a single page containing only the form on which users arrive after clicking a button on another page. So for example in a blog there is an href with the text: 'Interested in the possibilities for you organisation? Request information here!'. Sorry if it's getting confusing but it basically comes to down to this: how can I see from which page a user that submitted a form came? Is this something that can be added as a secondary dimension in the events tab?",

I've inspected the page and GTM preview debugger to know that the category is \"Button Clicks\" and action is \"Click\" which I've inserted into GTM alongside my GA tracking code UA-...- and I've also ticked \"Enable override settings\". I inserted this into the goal settings in GA as well.\n\nThe event is reaching GA because I can see it in behavior-events but I don't understand why it won't track it properly as a goal.

A Google Tag can hold multiple tag IDs, any of which are able to trigger it via GTM or on-site code.\n\nFor some reason Google makes [merging tags](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/12329709?hl=en-GB) sound like a great idea, when it usually just leads to measurement chaos and is a super bad idea unless you absolutely understand the implications of what you're doing.\n\nYou can't delete tag IDs, you can only add them to new tags. You can do that by clicking the splitting arrow icon on the tag ID. You can also merge them into other tags, but I don't think you can do that on an individual basis.\n\nWhat makes things extra confusing is that once you start moving any of this stuff around, your Tag ID, GA4 Measurement ID, and Destination ID can all refer to different websites and platforms *despite being identical in terms of their letters and numbers*.\n\nIf you're seeing those tag IDs there, it means that they're no longer associated with any other destinations or Google Tags (i.e. website 2). Destinations must have a linked Google Tag, so the other website's property should have been assigned to a new Google Tag, which would have generated new tag IDs.\n\nYour best bet might just be to leave that mess of IDs alone, figure out which Google Tag is currently sending data to your other website and what its IDs are, and make sure that all your tagging for website 1 refers to only one of the tag IDs from your screenshot, and all your tagging for website 2 refers to only one of the tag IDs from that other Google Tag.\n\nIf that Google Ads account is shared across both websites then, well, good luck. You may need to split it back out into a third Google Tag, otherwise you may inadvertently send the same website data to both destinations while trying to build remarketing audiences.",

Whenever you load that combined tag, it sends data to both destinations. \n\nIf you're using a remarketing tag in Google Tag Manager rather than adding the Google Tag to your site, it might be okay, but if you're tracking via anything that refers to any of those tag IDs, it'll send data to that GA4 property in your screenshot as well as GAds. \n\nWhat you can do is split off that AW- tag ID into a new Google Tag by clicking the split arrow icon, then click the minus icon next to the GAds destination which should let you move it into the Google Tag you've just created while preserving its original Tag ID.\n\nIf you want, you can also split off the Tag ID that corresponds with the other website's Measurement ID (found in its GA4 admin settings > data collection > data streams > its data steam), find that other destination (from that same menu you can click into its tag settings to see where it is), then move that destination into the new tag with its Measurement ID. \n\nThat's optional as you can still track that property via whatever GT- tag ID is associated with its GA4 destination currently, but I find it super confusing when the Measurement ID is a Tag ID for a different property.",

My boss created a regular Tag in Tag Manager a few months ago, so is it sending data to ***his*** GA4 account (that I'm only assuming exists)? I created a new GA4 account with the website property, but I've found no way to 'connect' the existing Tag to the new account I created. \n\nAm I misunderstanding how the Tag functions? Is there no way I can just link the Tag currently installed and gathering data to a new GA4 account? My brain is just struggling to comprehend the whole 'container' 'account' 'property' 'tag' 'trigger' thing. I need to put together a basic report, and I'm running out of time and patience. The Google articles and videos confused me, and trying to figure it out myself has made me go around in circles.\n\nI'm not sure if I articulated myself properly, I'll be happy to elaborate in the comments.",

As nervous as everyone gets, these algorithms are not designed to track user behavior to such a degree that they can accurately track everything they do.

As the internet evolves with age, the backend on these products get more and more complicated with how they operate. For example, it is no longer legal to track user behavior over various urls, so the exact accuracy of a users data you can collect is less than what it used to be. You gotta put some level of guessing or prediction into the equation, again meaning that the different products might predict something slightly different. 16% is minimal",

If you're adding a GA4 tag, use the Measurement ID.\n\n\n\n\nIf \"Enhanced Measurement\" is enabled for the Google Tag you are using, page_view events should be tracked automatically when¬†the Google Tag triggers. If it's disabled you will have to send a manual page_view event with the GA4 Tag (after triggering the Google Tag).\n\n\n\n\n>There was also TWO tag ids in my analytics account so I just grabbed the first one\n\n\nDon't just pick one at random. Make sure the Google Tag you've selected actually has the desired Measurement ID mapped as a Destination.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, just in case you've missed this part, make sure you actually published the changes in your GTM workspace.",

More so because the documentation is all over the place and Google Analytics itself is menu diving hell in its own right.\n\nThat being noted, I have an existing website that we configured with Google Tag Manager so that any tags created with Google Tag Manager would be used automatically, and would help store page view events, click events etc.\n\nMy main thing is this:\n- How do I hook the existing Google Tag Manager tags so that when they are triggered, they send data to an existing 'Data Stream' that exists on Google Analytics?\n\nI ask this because it looks like you have to not only create a duplicate tag on the Google Tag Manager side to specifically use Google Analytics, but when I do so, it wants the measurement ID and complains that it's not present in the container even when I put this value into the related field.\n\nDo I have to add yet another Google Tag that specifies the Google Analytics measurement id value somehow?\n\nOn top of that, if I find the Data Stream section and look to add a custom event, the event section itself on Google Analytics wants its own triggers, which defeats the purpose of defining the triggers on the Google Tag Manager side.\n\nReally, ideally, I just want it so that when a Google Tag Manager based tag fires, it just sends the data to Google Analytics.\n\nOtherwise, I have found this process to be pretty damn difficult, frustrating, and stupidly hard for someone who knows a ton about tech and computers.",

Correct me if I am wrong but I understand your problem is that you have defined custom events on Google Tag Manager and want to see them on Google Analytics 4 property. Ideally you do not need to create custom events within GA4. You can define an event with a proper trigger and If your measurement ID is correct you should see the event on GA4. I would suggest you to do a simultaneous debugging. Once you open the preview mode on GTM also open the GA4's debug view (Admin->Data Display->Debug View). Trigger your new tag and you should see the event in GA4's debug view. Once you successfully do it, it means your GTM is working and sending data to your GA4 account. However, this does not mean that you will see your new event immediately on your events report. After publishing your GTM container wait up to 48 hours. In this point you should see your event at the reports.  \n\n\nAn additional note is that you should have at least one Google tag (previously known as Google Analytics Configuration Tag) that is firing at all pages (or all the pages you want to track). If you do not have such a tag GTM will give you an error stating that Google Tag is not found on the container. It is a tag pretty easy to set up; just enter your measurement ID and set the trigger to all pages' pageview.   \n\n\nLet me know if it helps.",

Currently, I'm setting up Google Analytics for a website and encountered the following issue:\n\nWhen I open Tag Assistant in preview mode:\n1) I open the dropdown menu to select product categories, click on an item in the dropdown. In the debug, I see \"Click\" on the input to open the categories, but there's no click when selecting a specific category.\n2) After filling out an ad and successfully publishing it, a popup window appears. Initially, it displays information that the ad is being processed. When it's successfully published, another element appears in the same popup indicating that the ad has been successfully published. Here's the problem: the appearance of the container itself is visible in debug as a \"Visible element.\" However, when the element indicating successful ad placement appears, nothing appears in debug.\n\nI managed to find out that debug takes information from the dataLayer. I asked our frontend developer to add clicks on the category and the appearance of the successful banner to the dataLayer. However, he replied that they don't send anything to the dataLayer at all (quote: \"We don't send anything for GTM\").\n\nI don't understand if any data can be \"automatically\" sent to the dataLayer if the frontend doesn't send anything. Who misunderstands something - me or the frontend developer?\n\nPerhaps there's a way to solve my problem on my side?\n\nThanks for the help!\n",

You wouldn't use page\\_view for this, but likely a custom \"taxonomy\" event with a parameter or two that you then unearth via custom dimensions within GA4.\n\nGA4 reporting is flexible enough though that if you did decide to instead send the taxonomy tags as a comma or vertical bar separated list, you could manipulate existing reports or create an exploration report that would be able to filter using that string to include / exclude one or more tag. This would cut down on the number of events and network hits involved.",

The trigger group will then fire your tag once.\n\nI'm happy to take a more direct look into this for you if you want to share details in a DM.",

Data layer values could be eventCategory, eventAction and eventLabel\n- one GA \"event\" tag that pulls the variables from the ones you setup for category, action and label, and that fires on your custom event trigger.\n\nWhen setup correctly, you just need to push your event to the  datalayer with something like this\n\ndataLayer.push({\n    event: 'trackEvent',\n    eventCategory: 'your category',\n    eventAction: 'your action',\n    eventLabel: 'your label'\n});\n\nAnd you won't need to configure gtm for every specific event.

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI going to add Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager to my site, but I'm not sure what the cleanest way is, because i found multiple guides.\n\n**GTM**\n\n[https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/quickstart](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/quickstart) says, I need to add the following two snippets:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    <!-- Google Tag Manager -->\n    <script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':\n    new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\n    j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=\n    'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);\n    })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXX');</script>\n    <!-- End Google Tag Manager -->\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    <!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->\n    <noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXX\"\n    height=\"0\" width=\"0\" style=\"display:none;visibility:hidden\"></iframe></noscript>\n    <!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->\n\nThese two add GTM to my site. That's clear. But I'm wondering, if GTM automatically loads GA.\n\nThat's because [this guide](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-set-up-google-analytics/) says, I only have to add GTM and create the GA property/tag in GTM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analytics**\n\n[https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs?hl=de](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs?hl=de) says, I need to add the following snippet to my site:\n\n    <!-- Google Analytics -->\n    <script>\n    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n    (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n    m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n    })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n    \n    ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');\n    ga('send', 'pageview');\n    </script>\n    <!-- End Google Analytics -->\n\nThat adds GA to my site, but is it needed if I already added the code above and did the steps from the hootsuite guide?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analytics > measurement > gtag.js**\n\nTo make my confusion complete, there is gtag.js and the [corresponding guide](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs). To be hones: I don't know what gtag.js is and what it does. It seems to me, that I can create/add tags to google analytics, but how is different to the tag manager then?\n\nThe guide says to add:\n\n    <!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->\n    <script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID\"></script>\n    <script>\n      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n      gtag('js', new Date());\n    \n      gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');\n    </script>\n\nSame question: Do I need it if I already added the GTM snippet from above?",

Sometimes, plugins or themes can interfere. In GTM's Preview mode, look in the event stream for 'wpformsFormSubmit' when you submit the form. If it doesn't show up, the trigger won't activate.  \n  \nIf it isn't firing, you might need to add a small JS snippet to trigger a custom event or check WPForms docs for GA/GTM integration steps.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nHoping to get some help from the analytics community here. I'm an email marketer, not a professional analyst, and I'm trying to get better at measuring the success of my campaigns in GA4. I've hit a wall with some revenue data that just doesn't make sense to me.\n\n**The Problem I'm Seeing**\n\nWhen I build reports in GA4 Explore, I see a massive difference between two metrics. For my newsletter campaigns in one month, GA4 reported:\n\n* `Total Revenue`: $410k USD\n* `Item Revenue`: $190k USD\n\nI know shipping/taxes can cause a small difference, but this is huge and makes it impossible for me to know the real financial impact of my emails.\n\n**What I've Found So Far**\n\nI did some digging and noticed the problem is almost entirely in campaigns related to our loyalty program, where we remind customers about their points.\n\nI managed to isolate a single transaction from one of these campaigns, and this is where it gets really weird:\n\n* In one report, this transaction's `Total Revenue` is \\~**31 000**\n* In another report, the `Item Revenue` for the exact same transaction is only **442**\n\n**My Best Guess (and this is where I need you!)**\n\nAgain, I'm not an analyst, but my hypothesis is this:\n\nWhen a customer uses their loyalty points to get a \"reward\" product, our system still fires a `purchase` event. Could it be that the `value` parameter (which becomes `Total Revenue`) is being set to the full market price of the reward, while the `items` array (which calculates `Item Revenue`) is correctly showing only the small amount of *real money* the customer paid?\n\n**My Questions for You All:**\n\n1. Does this sound like a plausible explanation? Has anyone ever seen an e-commerce setup that tracks loyalty points this way?\n2. As a marketer, what can I do right now to get a cleaner view of the *real monetary revenue* from my campaigns? Is there a report I can build to reliably see the revenue I'm actually generating?\n3. What is the \"correct\" way this should be tracked?\n\nAny advice or insight would be massively appreciated!\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm an email marketer seeing a huge discrepancy between `Total Revenue` and `Item Revenue`. I *think* it's because our loyalty point redemptions are tracked with the full market value in `Total Revenue`, but only the real money paid in `Item Revenue`. Has anyone seen this, and what's the best way for me to report on the actual, real-money results of my campaigns?",

So, whoever developed your event did exactly what Google instructs to.\n\nWhile most would fix it, it might be worth thinking through it - you'll no longer have both pre and post discounted revenue (total v. item), you'll only have discounted. As long as pre-discounted revenue isn't ever a considered metric, great, but as is you have both. In favor of the fix, if you're sending purchase data via pixel, they probably want the actual transaction value. \n\nAlso, while it's a little manual, but you report full item value now without committing discounted total revenue reporting:\n\n1. Create two item-scoped reports in two tabs of an exploration with dimensions item name/id/whatever, item quantity, item price, and metric item revenue.\n2. filter one for item revenue = 0 and another for item revenue > 0. Export the revenue = 0 tab and calculate the total \"would have been\" item revenue: item quantity \\* item price\n3. Sum them if you want: The exported manual calculated report and the revenue > 0 reports should sum more closely to your total revenue number.\n\nKeep in mind that you can also develop things like 'discount', 'coupon', 'campaign', etc. into the item or purchase e-commerce array... and then into explorations as custom dimensions provided they've been added in the Admin custom definitions section.\n\nTL:DR: If it's as simple as wanting total rev to reflect discounts, your devs just need to include coupon/campaign/discount/? value as a parameter in the purchase event and update the value parameter to reflect the 'net value' of the transaction.",

If your items are indeed correct in terms of price paid, then use that as your focus value,. - total item revenue, and then also break it down by campaign\n\n3 Ideally value should reflect the actual money paid by the customer. Items should reflect real paid amounts Can you ask your Devs to adapt this (can points be calculated as a value and then deducted?)\n\nMight be useful to also add some custom prams like original price, loyalty points redeemed.\n\nWould be good to see your full ecommerce purchase event datalayer structure if you are doing it like that.

It works in tandem with **Google Analytics.** Though, you don't need to replace or change your current GA4 setup, since it doesn't impact it.\n\nIntegration takes 15 minutes.\n\n**What you'll get to test:**\n\n* **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English and receive instant visualizations, eliminating the need for complex SQL queries.\n* **Session Replay**: Watch real user sessions to identify bugs, UX friction, and confusing flows, helping you understand the user journey in detail.\n* **Feature/Page Usage Analytics**: Discover which features/pages are most engaged with and identify those that are underutilized, allowing for data-driven product decisions.\n* **Funnel Analysis**: Pinpoint exactly where users drop off in their journey and understand the reasons behind it, enabling targeted improvements.\n* **Automatic Event Tracking**: Implement tracking without Google Tag Manager, as we automatically capture and tag every user action.\n\nWe‚Äôre not selling anything ‚Äî just looking for honest feedback.  \nYou‚Äôll get full onboarding help and access to all features. Zero commitment.\n\nIf you want to better understand your users, **comment below**!\n\nDo you think nobody needs it? You have any questions, doubts? Let's discuss here.

Phew.\n\nLooking at your screenshot of mediums, I probably wouldn't start investigating ad traffic or any specific channel to start, as all of your mediums (including Organic) seem to have dropped simultaneously.\n\nDoes your channel report provide any clues though?...Did you all of the sudden see a proportional spike in \"unassigned\" or other channel (SMS, etc.) at that time? I don't think 'unassigned' has a source/medium, and so wouldn't be included in the sessions report in your screenshot. That'd probably be too easy, but quick to confirm.\n\nDid your consent settings change at all? For example if your consent was set to auto accept and then configured to auto deny, your traffic might drop off.\n\nWas there a code release on the site around then? If so, is it possible that the GTM code snippet was deleted or moved somewhere else on some high traffic page(s) and that's preventing the dataLayer from loading, or causing it to be overwritten? If deleted, no tracking and a huge drop off. Also, I'm assuming you did, but just in case: did you check GTM versions to make absolutely sure that nothing new was published?\n\nThose are usual suspects for a channel-agnostic and precipitous drop in traffic, all events, etc. like that. Drops like these are almost always technical implementation issues - it's as though GA4 has disappeared from the site's code base. Either that, or there's something opting the vast majority of users out of tracking. The silver lining is that the drop is huge and that it's not channel-specific it doesn't seem - the problem will probably stick out like a sore thumb when you get a little further under the hood. \n\nI'd open the site, open Console in Dev Tools, and start testing. In Console, you can see what events are firing by entering 'dataLayer' into the prompt. If you're familiar with GTM debugging, that's even better.",

I've come across a nice challenge since it's a part-time I can do on weekends, not with a great payment, but good enough to establish some portfolio and possibly launch my first agency or launch myself as a freelancer\n\n  \nThey want me to create 2-3 slides on how would I technically tackle their issues and present my action plan. While it's more or less straightforward to me how to implement GTM with GA4 and other tags, configure conversions, create UTM tagging rules and set it up with Google ads, the project seems complex (18 businesses) and I'm wondering if anyone more experienced here could give me some pointers and tips that I can improve my presentation. \n\nAny little hacks or \"how would I do it\" are helpful - willing to share a reward in case I win the process and get the client.\n\n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n**Role: Digital Marketing & Analytics freelance consultant (8-16h/week)**  \n  \nObjetive: help unify digital marketing operations across its 18 businesses.

This individual must quickly assess the client's current digital marketing landscape and implement a unified framework to ensure all businesses are tracking, defining conversions, and integrating data consistently.  \n\\- A highly hands-on approach is essential, as this role goes beyond just project management but also direct execution‚Äîsetting up integrations, resolving technical challenges, and providing clear guidance to internal teams. The ideal candidate will have deep expertise in paid search advertising, with a strong emphasis on tracking accuracy, attribution modeling, and performance optimization to drive measurable results.",

        "selftext": "Hi all, apologies in advance for the super long post but I'm at my wits' end and have no idea how to resolve this. Please be kind ‚Äî I actually don't know much about GA or GTM beyond what I have read on Google instructional articles as I am primarily a graphic designer who was kind of forced to moonlight as a marketing/analytics person by my boss (but that's another story).\n\nAnyway: the main issue is that this quarter, 60k out of 62k visits to our website's homepage has a session source/medium of (not set). We've had some (not set) data in the past before but never this much, and there was a little yellow warning sign next to the data that said this data was coming up as (not set) because no data was received. However, the most immediate solution that Google has for this is to make sure the website's Google Tag has a trigger of \"initialisation - all pages\" in Google Tag Manager ‚Äî which I had done in Google Tag Manager ages ago and nothing about it has changed.\n\nHowever, Google Tag Manager is also now telling me that there's an urgent issue because my Google Tag has stopped sending data. Clicking on the Help article for this leads to instructions on how to set up the website's Google Tag in GTM and GA4, both of which I also did ages ago, and upon re-checking there really doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the way the tags are set up on both platforms. My containers are all published in GTM. Under Admin > Data Streams > View tag instructions in GA4, there is a green tick telling me that data is flowing, and when I type the website URL into the bottom box to scan, another green tick comes up indicating the tag is installed and working.\n\nSo basically I have no clue what on earth is going on ‚Äî I don't understand why GTM is telling me that my Google Tag hasn't been sending data for at least 48 hours, and I don't know why or if this has caused the 60k (not set) data coming up on Google Analytics. I know this may be two entirely separate issues, but any help would be appreciate on either or both!!",

I have background in platforms like Mixpanel and Amplitude which doing analysis like that was extremely easy.\n\nI also have tried to connect with Bigquery and I have tried to connect directly to postgresql using airbyte, so i can use the raw data and do the analysis with SQL but the data does not contain the events which is mindblowing.

Create a filter for version A and version B using your event parameter. Analyze your scroll rate, conversion rates, etc.. at session-level.\n\n- Use BigQuery in the same way by filtering session_id which contains the event param version A or B...\n\nNow to make it easier for you next time I would advise setting your event parameter landing_version on the Google Tag directly instead of on a unique landing_array event. It will ensure that your parameter is populated on every single event which uses your Google Tag. Easier to manipulate later.\n\nYou could also use the User Properties feature in the same way to make sure this value is available on all interactions done by the user.",

The main goal is to differentiate the traffic coming from each domain, and still also be able to track the ‚Äúmain domain.‚Äù\n\nThe websites were all registered through godaddy, and then transferred all to AWS. All management of those domains are under AWS now, something I do not have access to. However, I do have access to all of the Google Analytics/Google Tags Account.\n\nCan someone help me achieve what was mentioned before? I have considered adding some kind of tracking code through the URL that each domain forwards to(like mainwebsite.com/trackingcodeforexample2/ . However, how would I set that up, and even connect that through AWS?¬†\n\nAnother thing commonly suggested is putting the tracking code on the actual code of the website, which is another thing I don‚Äôt have.\n\nPSA: Before anyone goes \"ask for more access to troubleshoot\", my boss doesn't know how to give me access, I just want to get this thing done, and I'm just an intern/contractor.\n\n",

(The campaign is called Lady Kings of Texas if you want to look for it. I don't think I can link it here without getting removed by auto moderation.)\n\nS&S has a place in the campaign dashboard to insert a GA measurement ID, and that's been done, but no data is being registered. It is showing up in the HTML though, and Seed&Spark has said it's been done correctly, so it appears it's done as it should. However, S&S customer service says the issue is on Google Analytic's side, not theirs.\n\nI think that might be wrong though and from what I can tell, it's because the implementation on the backend is still using UA and not GA4. But I'm not well-versed enough to know for sure. I've tried debugging with Google Tag Manager and it's showing that a legacy tag is detected and so can't be dubugged.\n\nThe script call in the HTML looks like this:\n\n        <script>\n           window.ga = window.ga || function () {\n                (ga.q = ga.q || []).push(arguments)\n            };\n            ga.l = +new Date;\n            ga('create', 'G-6PR7T653X8', 'auto', 'filmmaker');\n            ga('filmmaker.send', 'pageview');\n        </script>\n\nAs I understand, that's legacy UA code, not the current GA4 code. If so, is that enough to prevent data from going to the GA Property? Or is there something else that needs to be done on the GA side to make it work? Thanks for any insight.",

If for now, all you care about is getting known and reaching users, then your current business goal is to spend money on marketing, at a loss, as it would not necessarily automatically mean revenue, just visitors. \n\nBut anyway, Google Ads will optimize towards one or the other, depending on your setting. This means, you'll likely reach greater number of users with CPC since the algorithm doesn't require them to convert to scale the campaign up. \nIf it optimizes towards a business goal like a subscription, then the reach will be lower, less users on your app. But those users may convert a lot better than the ones targeted to just \"visit\".",

Setting up a monthly touch base or data review where you‚Äôre reviewing the same metrics and measures on a regular basis is super helpful.

In my opinion, after you build your remarketing campaign, you should A/B test which audience works better - general remarketing, or your unique audience (i.e. users who meet the criteria for visiting a product page minus the audience of converters for that conversion).   \n\n\nGoogle Ads success is 100% built on training their AI to go after the right audience, in the right place, with the right ads.",

In a case where we have multiple CTAs with the same text name, then we'll attempt to create unique triggers and tags for those based on CSS Selector. No need to collect the click text in these cases.\n\nOne additional step for scenarios 1 and 2, is that you'll have to create a custom metric in GA4 for those additional event parameters.\n\nDue to limitations in GA4, you'll want to link to either Looker Studio or BigQuery to get a complete report on the additional event  parameters for click text that were clicked on over time as GA4 only gives you like the last 30 minutes or something annoying like that.",

        "selftext": "(Reposting this, because the other one got removed probably due to links to screenshots)\n\nHi everyone!\n\nWe just discovered an issue that has apparently been going on for quite a while (possibly since we switched to GA4) and we're trying to figure out if this is some weird setup issue on our side, or a potential bug in GA4.\n\nWhen measuring traffic to our study program websites, we pass along a program ID to Analytics to not be dependent on the exact URL. We use Google Tag Manager for our setup, so it looks as follows:\n\n* CMS pushes the program ID to the data layer\n* A variable reads this data layer value as is\n* A tag uses this variable to send the program\\_id parameter along with the event to GA4\n* GA4 has a custom dimension that uses the program\\_id parameter\n\nGood to know is that these program IDs are all uppercase, no exception.\n\nWhat we're observing in GA4, however, is that for one specific program, the program id is lowercase: *it is reported as 'inf', instead of 'INF'*.\n\nI have confirmed that:\n\n* The CMS correctly pushes the uppercase value to the GTM data layer\n* GTM correctly sends the uppercase value to GA4\n\nBut what's more, we also have a BigQuery export and this specific program ID is *the only one that's not exported correctly to BigQuery*. It is exported as a null value.\n\nAs a result, in a dashboard where we're using this program ID as a drop-down filter, one program is completely missing.\n\nMy gut feeling says this is a bug in GA4, possibly related to a reserved keyword or something. That's mostly because as far as I could tell, we're not making any exceptions for the 'INF' program and all the others are working just fine.\n\nWas hoping you guys have any ideas or are perhaps able to confirm this issue. I wasn't able to find a good way to report a potential GA4 bug to Google; the community forum looks pretty dead to me, and I wanted to gather some more info first anyway.\n\n**I'm attaching some images** to show:\n\n* The variable setup in GTM\n* The fact that indeed uppercase 'INF' is sent to GA4\n* The fact that GA4 shows it as 'inf' while all the other values are uppercase\n\n[Variable setup showing that we don't perform a 'change case' operation](https://preview.redd.it/q66xu3tmf7kd1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=0071b7811ade2c7fac73f09c6b7973d46d6ae8ca)\n\n[Value passed to GA4](https://preview.redd.it/c6r8ml7sf7kd1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=79fa3b4225d1b86ce2d5d28609397b45643cd091)\n\n[Value passed to GA4](https://preview.redd.it/elp6v5dtf7kd1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=9512a219297e64c84ac016417b913d74f3a81054)\n\n['INF' has now turned into 'inf' in GA4.

I am asking because I suspect that the \"inf\" is somehow interpreted as infinity which might then appear in one of the numeric columns.\n\nIf that is the case: As far as I know there is no way to explicitly tell GA4 that something is a string. So if GA4/BigQuery think it is a numeric value then the only workaround I know is to add some text add to the value, e.g. a dot, an underscore or similar.   \nOf course this messes up reporting, but if you do it only for \"INF\" value (easy to do with a lookup table in GTM) then the impact is minor.

        "selftext": "I've done a bit of digging and wondering if removing a plugin I was trialling on a WordPress site could have affected my Google Site Kit / Analytics figures? Details:\n\nOn April 12th I spotted that JetPack were now charging to look at my traffic figures in detail, so I thought I'd look elsewhere. We're a small website and don't exactly pull in enough money to make the premium features worthwhile. I already had (and still have) Google Site Kit installed, linked to Search Console, Analytics, AdSense, PageSpeed Insights and Tag Manager. However, I spotted MonsterInsights and installed it for a trial.\n\nI gave it a few hours, realised that it was just a freemium overlay of Google Analytics, and uninstalled it. I opted to just use Google Site Kit / Analytics directly.\n\nHowever... two days later and my figures on Analytics have tanked. On the 13th and 14th April - the two days after my tinkering and the only two since then that I can see on Analytics - we're down a consistent 65% in terms of visitors. It's even labelled as \"Anomoly Detected\". Except that the Jetpack overview for the same dates disagrees with that, and is showing figures roughly inline with what we'd usually have.\n\nWhat could have broken with Site Kit when removing Monster? And any idea how I could fix it? Do I need to reinstall MonsterInsights and tinker with anything? Or remove and reinstall Site Kit?\n\n\\[EDIT\\] I've looked further and individual pages are getting views and being registered on Analytics, but their individual views are all down by huge percentages. The implication being that any tags / header code must still be in place otherwise at least some pages wouldn't be registering traffic.\n\nThanks in advance for any pointers.",

I recently agreed to help get someones website set up on GA4 to track purchases as a conversion. It's an ecommerce site built in shopify.\n\nWhen I began working on this project they had no GTM and no GA4. So I set up the tag manager and connected it to a new GA4 property I had set up based on the clients old UA account. All the prebuilt metrics/events are tracking correctly so I know the GA4 property is connected to the site. The GTM also says it is passing data correctly to the GA4 property.\n\nHowever, I have been trying for WEEKS to get an event (and subsequent conversion) set up to fire when a customer makes a purchase. You would think that this would be a really easy task to accomplish but no matter what I have tried **none** of my events are firing (and therefor cannot be tracked as a conversion). I have tried EVERYTHING I can think of. I've changed around the event parameters/conditions, setting up a button click google tag to fire when they click \"purchase\", I've tried a google tag that fires on page view of just the cart. Absolutely nothing is working.\n\nIf anyone has encountered this before please help me. *Any* advice, tutorial, direction would be appreciated! I'm happy to provide any details needed to help figure this out\n\n**Edit: I got it to work using the native Shopify app, definitely an easy fix to a complicated issue.

It would be helpful if someone can explain how they do it.\n\nI feel like I've set it all up correctly, but I am unable to see the results of my content\\_group values in Google Analytics.\n\nMy site is on Drupal, and I can successfully add data into the data layer using the Data Layer module.  I can confirm that the data is being stored in the data layer array by typing dataLayer in the console.  For example, in the 6th index of the dataLayer array, I can see:\n\nfield\\_author: {id: '314', label: 'Dan Smith', bundle: 'author'}\n\nI set up variables for these values in Google Tag Manager.  The Variable Type is Data Layer Variable.  The Data Layer Variable Name is field\\_author, which should return 'Dan Smith' from the field\\_author object in the dataLayer array.\n\nI set up a Google Tag.  It's a GA4 Event type tag.  It is set to trigger on all pages.  The event name is page\\_data.  Then I enter in Event Parameters.  The Event Parameter is content\\_group, and the value is the variable I created, {{field\\_author}}.\n\nI can verify that this is working so far by using the Preview mode on Google Tag Manger.  If I launch a page on the site in preview mode, I can verify that the dataLayer is being sent to Google Tag Manager, with the field\\_author value.\n\nThe issue seems to be sending this content\\_group value to Google Analytics.  I look at my Google Analytics account for that site, and pull up Pages and Screens, then set the chart to show \"Content group.\"  Nothing shows.  I recently saw on value come through, so it seems to basically be connected, but it should be showing all page views for all values that I've set up in this way.\n\nIs there something I'm missing here?",

I can only do this because I understand how databases work, how to query using SQL, I know what a webhook is etc. \n\nEven doing basic implementations is easier when you can sort of guess what GA4 is doing on the backend. Custom scripting in GTM is also important sometimes.\n\n>What extra skills would you need to boost your salary?\n\nI would learn all the basic client-side tech (HTML/CSS/JS), get familiar with GA4 itself (and get the certs, which aren't overly difficult) and maybe/optionally do some online courses in stats and machine learning. It's not hard to distinguish yourself from most other GA4 practitioners, who tend to be fairly restricted to GA4 itself. Once you start integrating GA4 across CRMs and other systems like that you're pretty safe.",

History Source is one of the variables that can be toggled on. This is the history change loading in new content.\n\nI have a note to myself that using the above history change trigger was necessary when firing page load event tags, like a thank you page hit, otherwise the Page Title would be recorded as the previous page. But it looks like Wix actually fixed this, so I'm updating to use their 'Pageview' trigger properly now. I'd still keep the history change trigger activated on the side so you can see it in preview, like you noted sometimes it might catch a dynamic page load that pageview might miss.",

        "author": "fedaykin00",
        "id": "1csp8tb",
        "selftext": "**# BACKGROUND**\n\nMy organization uses a third-party marketing agency to manage certain advertising (let‚Äôs refer to that marketing agency as ‚ÄúFoo‚Äù). In the past, the name of that marketing agency was appended to the end of the utm\\_source value in the URL query string (e.g., utm\\_source=facebook-foo).\n\nWe are now beginning to move the marketing agency name reference to a new custom URL query parameter: utm\\_agency. I am passing the value of the utm\\_agency parameter to a new custom dimension (named ‚ÄúMarketing Agency‚Äù) in Google Analytics 4 by way of Google Tag Manager. Data is being received in that custom dimension as of March 14. All is good there.\n\nThere is still some active advertising using the previous URL structure with the agency name references in the utm\\_source value in the URL query string (e.g., utm\\_source=facebook-foo). So, for some amount of time in the future, the value will be captured by different URL query parameters: utm\\_source and utm\\_agency.\n\n\n\n**# ISSUE WHEN CREATING A CALCULATED FIELD IN LOOKER STUDIO**\n\nNow, my goal is to create a new calculated field in Looker Studio (let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúCalculated Marketing Agency‚Äù) that does the following:\n\n* When the ‚ÄúMarketing Agency‚Äù custom dimension value exists and does not equal ‚Äú(not set)‚Äù, set ‚ÄúCalculated Marketing Agency‚Äù as that value\n* Otherwise, when the value of ‚ÄúSession source‚Äù contains ‚Äúfoo‚Äù, set ‚ÄúCalculated Marketing Agency‚Äù as ‚Äúfoo‚Äù\n\nHowever, any function I have used so far that references the ‚ÄúMarketing Agency‚Äù custom dimension results in ‚ÄúCalculated Marketing Agency‚Äù only having a value defined *after* the date of creation for the ‚ÄúMarketing Agency‚Äù custom dimension in GA4 (March 14).\n\nBelow is an example of one of the formulas I have tested when creating the ‚ÄúCalculated Marketing Agency‚Äù calculated field. It returns the desired results on or after the date of creation for the ‚ÄúMarketing Agency‚Äù custom dimension in GA4 (March 14). However, it returns no value on dates before March 14, even though the \"Session source\" dimension *does* contain the relevant values before March 14.\n\n    CASE\n        WHEN Marketing Agency IS NULL\n            OR Marketing Agency = \"(not set)\"\n            THEN\n                CASE\n                    WHEN CONTAINS_TEXT( Session source, \"foo\" ) THEN \"foo\"\n                    ELSE \"(not set)\"\n                END\n        ELSE Marketing Agency\n    END\n\nBelow are other formulas I have tested when creating the ‚ÄúCalculated Marketing Agency‚Äù calculated field, reversing the order of the function to lead with the reference to \"Session source\" in case that had an impact. However, the results were the same.\n\n    CASE\n        WHEN CONTAINS_TEXT( Session source, \"foo\" ) THEN \"foo\"\n        WHEN Marketing Agency IS NULL THEN \"(not set)\"\n        ELSE Marketing Agency\n    END\n\n    CASE\n        WHEN CONTAINS_TEXT( Session source, \"foo\" ) THEN \"foo\"\n        ELSE Marketing Agency\n    END\n\nI did confirm that the following formula *does* return a value for all dates (before and after March 14) when creating the ‚ÄúCalculated Marketing Agency‚Äù calculated field ‚Äî referencing only the \"Session source\" dimension and not the \"Marketing Agency\" custom dimension.\n\n    CASE\n        WHEN CONTAINS_TEXT( Session source, \"foo\" ) THEN \"foo\"\n        ELSE \"(not set)\"\n    END\n\nI also tested the following formula when creating the ‚ÄúCalculated Marketing Agency‚Äù calculated field, just to confirm whether or not the value of the \"Marketing Agency\" was stored as NULL before the date of creation for the ‚ÄúMarketing Agency‚Äù custom dimension in GA4 (March 14). However, it still returned no values before March 14.\n\n    IFNULL(\n        Marketing Agency,\n        \"(not set)\"\n    )\n\nIt seems I need some expression to account for the lack of value in the \"Marketing Agency\" custom dimension, since its value is not even NULL prior to its date of creation in GA4 (March 14).\n\n\n\n**# MAIN QUESTION / SUMMARY**\n\nIs there a way to accomplish this so that I have a calculated field in Looker Studio (\"Calculated Marketing Agency\") that defines its value based on *whichever* of the two other dimensions (\"Session source\" or \"Marketing Agency\") actually has the relevant reference value, regardless of whether the ‚ÄúMarketing Agency‚Äù custom dimension existed in GA4 on a given date?",

You said you have no idea what the JavaScript that you copy/pasted into your site means, and in terms of time and effort I think that's a much better place to start in terms of your learning journey, while you let an expert do steps 2 - 5.\n\nOnce you have the payment details connected back to your site, the setup is a pretty standard e-comm setup in GTM and GA4. You need the details from PayPal to be pushed into the datalayer as variables in that code you got, e.g. `\"value\": donationValue`. Make sure transaction ID is a unique ID for every transaction. Then in GTM you can create datalayer variables that takes those details and sends them to GA.",

However, Cliniko has made it difficult to track user's sales conversion whenever a booking is made on our website. Once a booking is made, the page does not reload or redirect to a confirmation page as everything happens within the iframe.   \nUpon further investigation, we found out that Cliniko blacklisted Google Analytics due to the UK-EU GDPR laws. We, therefore, need to create a workaround, which has partially been made by inserting a listening event script on the page, which is then picked up on Google Tag Manager.  \nHowever, the issue with that is that we have no way of tracking what service was booked and how much it was. This would pose a problem as we'd be unable to identify how much a campaign has generated in sales conversion. \n\n  \n",

The first is that Google Ads is simply not tracking all conversions that I'm seeing in GA4. Note: conversions are on a page that is only accessible via Google Ads. The second observation is that my Google Ads Tag (Tool & settings -> Setup -> Google tag) has a diagram that says, \"This tag has never been detected.\" I'm not sure if this tag is redundant with my current setup, but I've been side-eyeing it while trying to debug my conversion issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny and all help is appreciated.

        "selftext": "We are a medium sized website with 35k to 65k users a day, and we had a problem.\n\nWe'd had GA4 installed for a long time, we had just decommissioned Universal and GA4 wouldn't allow us to edit our channel matrix. I mean how dumb was that, right? Unassigned traffic had become the leading channel, accounting for 38% of traffic and paid campaigns were being  assigned to direct and unrelated channels seemingly at random. Our channels were a mess.  We couldn't accurately attribute leads or sales to any specific digital footprint.\n\nBut after a lot of study, a lot of WTF moments, I realized we were stuck in the old days, stuck in the Universal train of thought days...  and we were hurting the accuracy of our reporting. I eventually realized GA4 was our chance to clean house and get it right. I luckily had a digital director and a new sales director that came to believe the same thing after I showed them the data and a plan forward.\n\nWhat was so wrong with the Universal channel matrix? It allowed us to be lazy, to not think through our long term naming strategies. After all, we could fix the channel matrix. Right? Well, yes. With line after line of contains, equals and regex statements that had to be monitored, updated and managed. But there were other problems, misspelled links, improper use of strings, leading to 404 and 500 errors. Let me count the times that I tracked down a jump in 404 errors to a bad link in an advertisement that managed to slip and sneak its way through the QA process.\n\nSo we did a lengthy evaluation of Google's custom tagging documentation and created an internal UTM builder in Excel. But what about all those free UTM builders online, there's tons of them and don't require all that work. Because they are part of the problem. They allowed any person in the organization to build out UTMs without oversite or control. It was the wild west of UTM building, it was a nightmare of report building trying to account for every way an media rep could name a sales campaign. Why not use a free Excel UTM builder? Well, they replicate the functionality of an online UTM builder, still the wild west.\n\nI did start with one Excel builder that I thought was fairly robust, so I wasn't starting from scratch. We locked down everything that was a required field for our UTMs. Regions, sources, mediums, URL structures were all strictly controlled and conformed to GA4 custom channel building documentation. And....well, some people loved it, some people hated it. Many still wanted the wild west. But eventually, everybody came around, especially when the results came in.\n\nWe've been using our custom internal UTM builder for a month and a half.. as of the last two weeks, unassigned traffic went from 38% to less than 1% of all traffic.\n\nSo if you are having the same issues, I strongly suggest getting out of the wild west and look at building your own strict UTM builder.",

Our internal media managers would do this as Partner Co. / Media, and that's how they would track in internally. The person who had my job before, would just simply go into GA and update the default channel matrix and modify based on campaign information. \n\nIn GA4, that doesn't work. Instead, GA4 reports it, but can get confused and assign the traffic to \"Unassigned\" or if it's really confused, to some random channel, usually direct. \n\nThe ways this should have worked would be the company name would be in the utm\\_campaign as a value, with Facebook / Paid or YouTube / Paid for the source medium. \n\nThey would also use all kinds of symbols like +, {} or \\[\\], which google recommends not using. \n\nI went to the GA4 Google Help page for channels and built all the rules they mentioned into the builder. \n\n[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9756891?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9756891?hl=en)\n\nThis including, only allowing sources in the source list, which can be downloaded.

When they land on that page, GA4 is supposed to count this as a conversion. This event has been implemented with Google Tag Manager. At the time of set up, I previewed the new event in GTM preview mode and checked it in GA4 debug view and the event recorded fine at that time.\n\nI logged-in to GA4 today to see the updated purchase event numbers‚Ä¶. And to my horror, it said ‚Äú1‚Äù on March 20th. At first I was shocked, but then I knew this couldn‚Äôt be correct because every time a purchase is made, these customers go through a workflow. I checked the workflow and there have been 33 purchases since March 20th.\n\nSo, I tested the GTM preview and GA4 debug modes once more.

                "body": "That -20% discrepancy after switching away from your GTM work-around is a classic Shopify/GA4 problem, and it's frustrating because you were so close to the finish line with UA retirement.\n\nIt sounds like you moved from a robust, custom tracking setup back to the standard, client-side tracking offered by the native Shopify GA4 integration, which is the most likely root cause.\n\nClient-side tracking relies on the user's browser, and that‚Äôs where the data loss happens.\n\nThe main reasons for this kind of discrepancy are: users closing the thank-you page too fast before the GA4 tag fires; ad blockers, privacy extensions, or browser restrictions (like Apple's Intelligent Tracking Prevention, or ITP) preventing the GA4 script from running; and interruptions from third-party payment gateways like PayPal redirecting users away and sometimes back, breaking the session context.\n\nShopify's native integration typically uses client-side tracking, meaning the transaction data is sent from the user's browser, which is easily blocked or interrupted.\n\nShopify Analytics, in contrast, tracks transactions directly from its server when the order is created, making it the more accurate source of truth for revenue.\n\nTo fix this and future-proof your tracking, you should move to a server-side tagging solution.\n\nA powerful combination for this on a Shopify store is Google Ads Conversion API + Google Tag Manager + Stape.io.\n\nHere's how that combo works:\n\nInstead of having your tracking tags fire directly from the user's browser (client-side), you set up a server-side Google Tag Manager container, often hosted on a dedicated platform like Stape.io.\n\nWhen a user completes a purchase, Shopify sends the data server-to-server to your GTM container first.\n\nThis data includes all the information needed for accurate tracking, such as the transaction ID, value, and other ecommerce parameters for events like `view_item`, `add_to_cart`, `begin_checkout`, and, crucially, `purchase`.\n\nWith the data reliably sitting in your server container, you then use the Google Ads Conversion API to send the purchase conversion directly to Google Ads.\n\nThis is a much more resilient way to report conversions, as it bypasses ad blockers and browser-side restrictions entirely.\n\nYou're sending a direct server-to-server confirmation of the sale.\n\nYou also send a parallel event from the server container to GA4.\n\nThis dual-path approach is key to improving accuracy and is often referred to as 'deduplication,' where you send both a browser event and a server event with a unique ID, and Google only counts one, making sure the more reliable server event is prioritized if the browser event is blocked.\n\nUsing Stape.io is often recommended for Shopify because it specializes in server-side tagging hosting, simplifying the complex setup process of the GTM server container.\n\nIt provides a more stable environment for your tagging server than some other options and often offers pre-built templates for common tracking needs, making the implementation via GTM much smoother.\n\nIn short, this server-side setup makes your tracking resilient, ensures that events like `purchase` are sent reliably, and should bring your GA4 reported sales much closer to your Shopify revenue, potentially minimizing that 20% gap significantly.",

Everything that follows are *my* ideas that could solve the problem.\n\n---\n\nOkay so the tools at my disposal are complete freedom to modify the webpage however I want, Google Analytics (GA4), Google Tag Manager, and Big Query. \n\nBased on my research, this duration is called \"engagement time.\" It's automatically collected by analytics and sent to Big Query. But this is collected on events when the webpage/window has focus. Therefore, for a single user, it might be 1 minute here, 5 minutes there, 30 minutes here, etc. To find the total engagement time for a user, I would have to sum those together. \n\nI then have to do the same thing per user. I then have to average the sums.\n\nBut that isn't the answer to my question: that tells me the *total* gameplay time. I'm looking for the total gameplay time *before the \"free demo page\" was reached*.\n\nAnd what complicates this further is, I know from conversations, that some players restart the free demo and replay it. I bring this up to point out it's not as straightforward as summing the engagement time before the \"free demo page\" was reached. It needs to be per play through. \n\nI know a lot about SQL, but very little about Big Query. That said, I think the data in Big Query can answer this question. Problem is, the query seems so challenging, I'm hoping there's a easier solution.\n\nSomething that seems way easier is to use Google Tag Manager to keep track of a variable like \"free demo engagement time.\" The only reason I don't just go with that idea is, maybe even that is the hard way to solve the problem. For example, maybe there is a tab in Google Analytics that can just tell me the answer?\n\nGiven my limited knowledge of GA4, GTM, and Big Query, it would be nice to know which one to focus on learning. In summary, I'm looking for an answer to this question: **On average, how long does it take to complete the demo?**",

What we're seeing across the board is that events we mark as conversions are not tracking as conversions. The default purchase conversion is working perfectly, but none of our conversions built on custom events.\n\nAll events, including purchase are passing through the Server-Side tag manager. We're passing ALL parameters through as well as signals data. The reason I'm pointing the finger at Server-Side is because we ran the same test on three sites, two had server side and displayed the same behaviour and our direct to GA4 site marked conversions.\n\nThis is a head scratcher for me.\n\nUpdate: the issue was we had obfuscated the Measurement ID in our client tag thinking that it didn't matter since we had one Measurement ID and the server-side sends it there anyway. While almost everything works, conversions do not when you do this. The fix was using the regular unobfuscated measurement ID in the client tags.",

Create for each button one tag and one event and one trigger\n2. Create for all buttons one tag, use dynamic event names {{}} to track each button and one trigger\n3. Create for all buttons one tag, one event name, one trigger and afterwards use the custom event functionality to get events per button\n\nWhat would be best practices here and what would you recommend?\n\nMany thanks!",

                "body": "I use a systematic diagnostic approach, and your \"(not set)\" issue after migrating from WordPress to Node.js is a Layer 4: Processing issue with elements of Layer 2.\n\n**Layer 4** deals with how GA4 processes and interprets the data it receives. The \"(not set)\" value appears when GA4 receives events but can't properly attribute session source information. After platform migrations, this usually means the implementation is sending incomplete data.\n\n## The Node.js Specific Problem\n\nWordPress with plugins handles GA4 session management automatically. Node.js doesn't. Your dev team likely implemented basic tracking but missed critical session attribution requirements.\n\n## Quick Diagnostic\n\nRun this on pages showing \"(not set)\" traffic:\n\n```javascript\n// Check GA4 session continuity in Node.js app\n(() => {\n  // Check for GA4 cookies\n  const cookies = document.cookie.split(';').map(c => c.trim());\n  const gaCookie = cookies.find(c => c.startsWith('_ga='));\n  const sessionCookie = cookies.filter(c => c.includes('_ga_'));\n  \n  // Check page_view timing\n  const pageViewEvents = dataLayer.filter(d => d.event === 'page_view');\n  const sessionStarts = dataLayer.filter(d => d.event === 'session_start');\n  \n  console.log('GA Client ID:', gaCookie ? 'Found' : 'MISSING');\n  console.log('Session cookies:', sessionCookie.length);\n  console.log('Page views fired:', pageViewEvents.length);\n  console.log('Session starts:', sessionStarts.length);\n  \n  // Check if page_location is being sent\n  const hasPageLocation = pageViewEvents.some(e => \n    e.page_location || e.event_parameters?.page_location\n  );\n  \n  console.log('Page location parameter:', hasPageLocation ? 'Present' : 'MISSING');\n  \n  // Check referrer preservation\n  console.log('Document referrer:', document.referrer || 'EMPTY');\n  \n  return 'Check console for session attribution gaps';\n})();\n```\n\n## Root Causes for Node.js Apps\n\nYour 35-40% \"(not set)\" likely comes from:\n\n1. **Client-Side Rendering Issues** (Most likely)\n   - Node.js SSR sends initial HTML without GA4\n   - GA4 loads after React/Vue hydration\n   - First page_view fires without referrer data\n\n2. **Session Continuity Breaks**\n   - GA4 script reinitializes on route changes\n   - Session cookies not persisting properly\n   - Missing page_location parameters\n\n3. **Referrer Loss**\n   - Node.js app strips referrer headers\n   - Internal navigation overwrites external source\n   - URL fragments (#) breaking attribution\n\n## The Fix for Node.js\n\n### 1. Ensure Proper GA4 Initialization\n\nIn your Node.js app's main template/layout:\n\n```javascript\n// Initialize GA4 BEFORE any route changes\n// Place in your app's head or earliest loading point\nwindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\nfunction gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\n// Preserve original landing page data\nif (!sessionStorage.getItem('original_referrer')) {\n  sessionStorage.setItem('original_referrer', document.referrer);\n  sessionStorage.setItem('original_location', window.location.href);\n}\n\ngtag('js', new Date());\ngtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX', {\n  'send_page_view': false,  // Control page_view manually\n  'page_location': window.location.href,\n  'page_referrer': sessionStorage.getItem('original_referrer') || document.referrer\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Handle Route Changes Properly\n\nFor single-page apps (React/Vue/Angular):\n\n```javascript\n// On route change (React Router example)\nhistory.listen((location) => {\n  gtag('event', 'page_view', {\n    page_location: window.location.href,\n    page_path: location.pathname,\n    page_referrer: sessionStorage.getItem('previous_page') || document.referrer\n  });\n  sessionStorage.setItem('previous_page', window.location.href);\n});\n```\n\n### 3. Server-Side Fix (Node.js/Express)\n\nEnsure your Node.js server preserves attribution:\n\n```javascript\n// Preserve referrer headers\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n  // Don't strip referrer for analytics\n  res.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'no-referrer-when-downgrade');\n  next();\n});\n\n// For SSR, inject referrer into initial state\napp.get('*', (req, res) => {\n  const referrer = req.get('Referrer') || '';\n  // Pass referrer to your template\n  res.render('index', { \n    referrer: referrer,\n    landing_page: req.url \n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Why WordPress ‚Üí Node.js Breaks Attribution\n\n- **WordPress**: Plugins handle session management, referrer preservation, and proper event sequencing\n- **Node.js**: You must manually implement all attribution logic\n- **The Gap**: Your dev team implemented basic tracking but not attribution preservation\n\n## Expected Results\n\nAfter implementing these fixes:\n- \"(not set)\" should drop from 35-40% to under 5%\n- Organic traffic will show proper sources\n- Campaign parameters will persist correctly\n- Management will see accurate channel attribution\n\n## Quick Win\n\nAs an immediate test, check if \"(not set)\" traffic spikes during your highest organic traffic periods. If yes, it confirms the attribution is being lost, not that the traffic is actually direct.\n\nI Hope this helps!",

This session has (not set) as its landing page. Very common.\n2. Rogue event with no page\\_location parameter. Play with metrics (views, sessions, users) to see if users and sessions are more impacted. See if any popular non-standard events are firing on your pages.

If interested, I created a tool, Assertion Hub, that automatically tests your tracking implementation for you and notifies you if any errors ( or you can look at the test results in your admin dashboard). We also offer a free trial.   \nNo installation or coding knowledge required. No data is sent to the AI. Avoiding exposing personal information to the LLMs should be more than a suggestion.",

Check anywhere that you might have added the tag directly to the code, in GTM if you're using it, and in platforms that let you give them the measurement ID and they add it for you. \n\nWherever you see Tag 2, replace it with Tag 1. If both are on the same page, delete Tag 2 and make sure only one instance of Tag 1 is there. \n\nOption two is to combine the tags.

        "selftext": "Hi all - looking for a sanity check, do you use **one tag** and **one trigger** to manage/fire all of your custom events? \n\nWe have all our custom events triggered via dataLayer.push. In GTM, all parameters are added (referenced to dataLayer variable) to one GA4 event tag that fires on one trigger that references a lookup table for {{event}}. \n\n\n\nIt's an elegant solution for managing numerous events/parameters, however I'm running into the issue where events are reported with parameters where they shouldn't be:\n\n**For example consider the following event setup:**\n\nEvent: A, parameter 1, parameter 2\n\nEvent: B, parameter 3, parameter 4\n\n**When these events are triggered one after another, I get the following results:**\n\nEvent: A, parameter 1, parameter 2\n\nEvent: B, parameter 3, parameter 4, parameter 1, parameter 2\n\nIn a GA4 report I find all 4 parameters show values for Event B. Rater than event exclusive, the parameters seem to 'stack' in the order in which events are triggered. \n\n\n\nI'd hate to have to create a separate GA4 event tag for each of our custom events, but I'm not able to find a better solution to solve this data / reporting problem. \n\n",

                "body": "That's a really elegant solution but yes unfortunately you're going to run into the parameter \"stacking\" issue as the data layer wouldn't be cleared for each new push. Resetting the data layer after each push might fix it but I think that's a dangerous solution as you could end up missing recording events if you have many events that could trigger at the same time. One solution to try is to have differently named DLVs for different events. Keep all the parameters for your single event in GTM and then only the relevant parameters will populate depending on what the event is. You do end up with events that have blank parameters as a result but the trade off might be worth it to avoid the stacking.",

Just curious: what kind of report are you trying create where this is an issue? \n\nIf you can't adapt reporting to the stacking, I'd probably create event tags for each group of parameters you want to fire instead of for each event (e.g., Tag 1: param 1 param2; Tag 2: param3 param4) then create custom event triggers and assign them to the Tag that includes the parameters. \n\nI did all GA4 click event tracking with one tag once by adding data attributes to the site code and configuring the attributes as dataLayer variables. So, something like this...site code: <a class=\"button\" data-event-name=\"cta\\_click\". data-page-location=\"header\">, then create variables for the attribute {{event-name}} and {{page-location}}, and then use the {{event-name}} variable as the Event Name in the tag, add {{page-location}} to the tag parameters, create the Custom Event trigger, etc. Since each event included only the attribute values associated with event/code, it generated a lot of (not set) parameter values but I don't remember any stacking issue.",

You could do some advanced filtering of raw BQ data, but that might not be simple or scalable.\n\nI might be reading it wrong, but without Segments or by creating a tab with it's own filter for every event and targeted set of parameters, your filtering options are going to be limited because the Filter section doesn't allow for a single filter with conditions like \"event matches: x AND event parameter regex matches 3 or 4\". You'd have to have Tab 1: Filter 1 = \"event matches: x\" and Filter 2 = \"event parameters regex match parameter 3 and parameter 4\". \n\nYou could, theoretically, do something like Filter 1 = \"event matches: button\\_click\" and Filter 2 = \"event parameters regex match parameter 3 and parameter 4\" for all button clicks if you're also collecting and have as a dimension something that would distinguish them from each other like a <class>. \n\nI'd be a little nervous about committing to that maybe because those reports run out of tabs, and it might not be scalable in the long run. \n\nDunno. Just riffing here and I'm sure I don't fully understand your use case. Good luck!",

A page view event on the destination site (banner people)\n\nIn order to collect and report that click event to your GA4, you need an event listener - a bit of code that's listening for click events - and a GA4 event tag for outbound clicks that sends the click target URL to GA4. \n\nThere are relatively easy solutions for tracking all outbound clicks via GTM. You don't need to create an event for each banner. If you need help, and I can volunteer a little time to get you pointed in the right direction. Feel free to PM.",

That said, at least on the search side, the platforms are connected (just with auto-tagging being off).\n\nFor search, all the \"Session campaign/etc.\" data are pulling through to GA4 like they would if auto-tagged (i.e. the campaign names set in the platform). That said \"Session manual campaign/etc.\" are obeying the UTMs in all cases.\n\nFor display, everything is pulling through fine with the exception that most of the traffic is labelled \"google/cpc\" instead of \"google/display\" for \"Session source/medium\". Again, \"Session manual source/medium\" is correct.\n\nConsidering auto-tagging is turned off, is there any way to have the \"Session...\" data pull through as the UTMs direct (i.e. the way it is for \"Session manual...\")? - or should it be doing that, and something else is incorrect in the setup. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the ad platforms.\n\n(my fallback is simply to look at the \"Session manual...\" data, but I'd like \"Session...\" data to pull through as we want so that any default reports can show it properly and our display pulls through as \"display\" and not \"paid search\")  \n  \nThanks!",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone.\n\nI've been doing some research and it looks like it's no longer possible to manually tag URLs with UTMs if you have auto-tagging enabled in an ad account like Google Ads. In UA this was possible, but now the option is removed. So if you manually tag URLs but you have auto-tagging enabled then it will just be overridden with the auto-tagged values.\n\nSo it looks like if you want to use your own UTMs in your URLs then auto-tagging needs to be turned off for any ad accounts that have it. That seems like a big deal because data like cost and conversions won't get imported to GA4.\n\nBefore i go ahead and test this out....has anyone done this and knows all the cons for turning this off? Is it worth it?\n\nSource 1 -¬†[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11242870?hl=en#:\\~:text=If%20you%20use%20manual%20tagging%2\\[‚Ä¶\\]0Content%20and%20Manual%20Term%20dimensions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11242870?hl=en#:~:text=If%20you%20use%20manual%20tagging%20and%20auto%20tagging%20together%2C%20then%20the%20source%2C%20medium%2C%20and%20other%20traffic%2Dclassification%20dimensions%20use%20the%20auto%2Dtagged%20values.%20The%20manually%20tagged%20values%20for%20utm_content%20and%20utm_term%20are%20used%20for%20the%20Manual%20Ad%20Content%20and%20Manual%20Term%20dimensions)\n\nSource 2 -¬†[https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3095550?hl=en#:\\~:text=However%2C%20in%20Google%20Analytic\\[‚Ä¶\\]the%20absence%20of%20an%20override%20option](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3095550?hl=en#:~:text=However%2C%20in%20Google%20Analytics%204%20(GA4)%2C%20auto%2Dtagging%20is%20prioritized%20over%20manual%20tagging%20due%20to%20the%20absence%20of%20an%20override%20option)",

But 250, I'm going to look for more traffic to send to what ever imperfect measures I have.\n\nEven after conversion starts, I'll still look for statistically significant counts before concluding anything.

Meanwhile, every post on our website has no UTM tags - just the raw link. \n\nIn my understanding, when a user clicks on our link with a UTM tag in Facebook - it counts as one session and one pageview for this UTM tag. If he clicks on any link with no UTM tags on our website in the same session - it counts as one pageview for overall website statistics, but not for the UTM tag in the first link.\n\nBasically, even if he views 20 pages in this session - it still should be 1 session and 1 pageview for the initial UTM tag.\n\nHowever, when I viewed our stats for UTM links in GA4, I saw that number of views for every UTM tag is much higher (about 20% higher on average), than the number of sessions. How is this possible?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. I wouldn't have this question and just assume that my understanding is wrong, if our Facebook stats for link clicks were not also about much higher than our GA4 stats for sessions.

My background is in industrial engineering so digital marketing is a new field for me. That being said, I have worked quiet a bit with setting up BI system and data analysis so some knowledge is definitely transferable. \n\nI would be curious to hear from you experts out there:\n\n1. What does a well setup website in terms of GA look like? Is every site/button tagged or only conversions?\n2. Any sources for best practices and maybe mistakes to avoid?\n\nFrom my understanding so far, I would think that I want to tag every action on the website so I can get a clear picture how customers interact with it and improve upon it (or the ad once I start running them).\n\nThank you very much!",

I've worked both sides, and now as the client I'm very controlling of my UTM parameters.\n\nMore specifically: instead of `utm_campaign` all they have to do is place a tracking template in their ad campaigns and create their own `$agency_campaign` parameter. In GTM create a variable for URL Query, and in the field simply input `$agency_campaign`. Save this parameter to a session cookie for every visitor. Pass this cookie along as a parameter with every event (or at least the conversions), you can modify the page view event too. Then set up an event-scoped custom dimension in GA4 (man, I miss session-scoped dimensions).\n\nIt's a lot of setup, but they shouldn't act like it's impossible. And hey, more billable hours. Plus there's a lot of benefit to saving the campaign parameter as a 1st party cookie, for example: you can insert the cookie's value as a hidden field in web forms.\n\nquick edit: either that, or you can always CONCAT the two variables haha.",

        "selftext": "Using GA4 & GAds Tag at the same time\n\nHello everyone,\n\nSo I have a unique problem and thought a new perspective could help. GPT has opinions but Idk which is fact and which is hallucination. \n\nWe track WhatsApp clicks from our Shopify website (tracked using GA4, they just show up in GA4 because its included in the app we use for WhatsApp) as conversions in Google Ads but we also get calls from website top bar so I thought I should track those using Gads because the click event in GA4 tracks those but I had a hard time with custom events. \n\nAnyway I made the mistake of making two changes at the same time so dont know which is which but when I installed the GAds event snippet I just added a gtag with AW-xxxxx to my existing GA4 tag as Google recommends. Another change I accidentally made was in the WhatsApp app I enabled GA4 (it had a separate button for GA4) so what happened was my WhatsApp click disappeared because it started showing up under a different name because of that GA4 enabled option. But since GA4 reports show data quite late I did not see the new event and freaked out thinking my WhatsApp tracking has stopped. (It was a pain finding a Shopify app that had Analytics on for free)\n\nAt the same time my call tracking was working buy it was slightly over reporting (I thought). I dont have exact data from client so I couldn‚Äôt quite verify. Also I was tracking clicks on mobile number so it was bound to over report. \n\nAnyway I thought maybe my Whatsapp clicks were now being reported to my newly installed Gtag for calls thats why one disappeared and one was over reporting. Reason being that call tracking was using a function and reporting a url (tel:xxxxx) to the event snippet. But the event snippet was not verifying whether the url being reported was a phone link or not. It just checked url != ‚Äòundefined‚Äô and passed it on as a conversion and I thought maybe our WhatsApp tracking was calling the same function (since its a generic Google function that is called using onclick attribute) just passing on the WhatsApp API link and maybe that function was reporting to my new event snippet & since my event snippet just worked with any url it was firing & reporting to my GAds tag directly skipping GA4.\n\nAnyway, i later found out the issue with my Whatsapp event appearing under new name and fixed that but I also removed call reporting in panic and now will check back again but it did made me think if using both GA4 and Google Ads tag at the same time could have such issues? I did ask the app maker & saw their source code but couldn‚Äôt figure out how they were reporting those Whatsapp clicks to GA4 since it was a pretty bad code (all written in one line lol). \n\nShould I just stick to GA4 & try to track phone calls using the built in click event by creating a custom event or is it harmless to use both GA4 tracking & direct Gads tag? \n\nBtw reason I had to rely on GA4 for whatsapp link clicks to begin with was because our Shopify plan did not allow GTM so we used GA4 and switched through multiple contact apps until we found one with Google Analytics enabled automatically.",

You could include parameters, such as the membership level, etc... as needed. Then, mark this as a conversion in GA4.\n\nDepending on how your membership system works this would vary and would likely require changes to your data layer (but maybe you could use what's there already)\n\nFor example, you could create a GTM event tag:\n\nEvent: member\\_signup  \nvalue: {{purchase amount from data layer}}  \ncurrency: USD (or local currency code, or value from data layer if you have multiple currencies)  \nmember\\_level: {{the membership level selected from data layer }}\n\nAny custom parameters you'll need to register in GA4 admin.\n\nThat is what I would do. However, if you are set on using the `purchase` event you can. But, to know for sure the best strategy there we'd need to see what your data layer looks like when it fires after a member signs up. In other words, \"Send Ecommerce Data\" may or may not work based on the data layer implementation. It does sounds like you may need to create the eccommerce variable for the item array and other parameters, though.",

I reversed the sort from low to high, and the shop & root domain URLs were listed there, but with 0 views. However, when I changed the rows from page location to hostname, in aggregate it showed plenty of views associated with all the other subdomains. So it seems to be recording that views are happening on those subdomains but not on which URL. I then went into GTM preview and clicked around a few pages, and the main GA4 configuration tag did fire on all the various pages, and in the tag details says \"Send a page view event when this configuration loads - true\", but I'm wondering if I need to add a custom parameter to send the page URL with the page view too? But that still doesn't explain why the blog links showed views associated with specific URLs, since we don't have any separate tags or configs for the various subdomains, so the blog pages should be firing through the same tags as any other pages.\n\nAny idea what could be the issue?

As soon as we turn on the GA4 tag, our UA session/user counts increase by anywhere from 25-50% and we get an influx of sessions where the landing page is listed as \"not set\", bounce rate = 0% and the pages/session is 0.00. When our GA4 tag is turned off, we don't see any of these \"not set\" sessions in UA.\n\nI really want to get our GA4 up and running but I still want to be able to rely on our UA data in the meantime (until UA sunsets next year) and this data issue is getting in the way of that. Our developers aren't well-versed in GA4 yet and to this point haven't been able to figure out why this is happening. I would say my own knowledge of GA and GTM are intermediate and beginner-level respectively, but any insight or guidance on this would be very appreciated as I've hit a wall with this.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\\*Edited to fix a typo ",

I don't know if this was a pre-populated page or what, but all of our website pages are not listed there. I tried adding additional pages but it did not work. Should I just leave this page alone? Are these domains coming from the tracking code, or would they have been manually added? \n\nSorry if this is a stupid question.

You will see if there are any connected site tags. Usually it shows 0 but mine says 1. If we click on it there is an option to connect more tags.\n\nPlease let me know what you see",

At the moment, I basically have one tag with one event for all these navigational buttons and save all the details (so the name of the button) as parameters tagged to that event. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy doing this, I however (to the best of my knowledge), can not use the path exploration tool as all the individual buttons are essentially just represented as that one event.\n\nWhat would be the solution here? Create individuals custom events and tags for each navigational button?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated!",

Within the blog, however, my team member has a banner ad directing to sell our product and wants to know how many sales are driven by that banner. He asked how to tag the banner. \n\nThe blog already lives on the website, but I want to be able to differentiate between sales from a user on the blog clicking the sales page vs clicking the banner.

        "selftext": "Hi!  \nI am looking for recommendations on how to correctly set up Google Analytics and Google Ads for a client who has a parent site and multiple child domains. My client is an insurance agency with a parent domain. The individual insurance agents have their own child domains.  \nI run ads for the entire agency as a whole, using the parent domain as the final URL, tracking on their own Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and the owner's Google Ad account.  \nHere's where I am stuck... There's a specific insurance agent who wants to run Google Ads to promote her specific landing page (child domain). Should I create her own separate Google Analytics account for her child site? Her site already has the parent domain Google Analytics installed. Should I create her own Google Tag Manager account and install her Google Analytics account that way? Would her Google Analytics only track website data from her child site and not the parent domain?  \nNow with Google Ads, here's where I am nervous. I manage ads for the agency as a whole. This agent would be paying for her ads separately. To do this, I would need to create a new ad account. That account technically would have the same domain and would be technically the same name too. From what I read in a discussion on the Google Ads Help forum, \"You can't have two Ads accounts for same business/website. This is policy violation and you can search this community that so many users already suspending for having two Ads accounts. Google Ads policy is very simple and only one account is allowed per business/website/domain/person/organization/payment.\"  \nSo now I am questioning everything because I do not want to risk suspending the entire agency's Google Ad account due to a misunderstanding on structuring accounts specifically for parent/child domains. Thank you for reading, and appreciate any recommendations.",

Each location has a different owner, with their own different marketing budgets, etc. Defintely not on your level but similar.  \n\n\nFor GTM... I would have on the account level the company as a whole hold all of the child down different containers.\n\n* Parent Company Account\n   * Child domain container 1\n   * Childer domain container 2, etc\n\nThis way I can separate GA4 accounts. For GA4 .... i think it depends on their business as a whole but I don't think it would hurt for each domain to have their own GA4 account. BUT again I have no idea what their busienss structure is like. I separate GA4 accounts for my client due to some of the marketing tools each location uses. You can set up each location to only show traffic for that child domain, OR for the entire domain. Again that depends on their business goals.\n\nFor Google Ads, I haven't ran into this issue yet because only one location owner is running ads. However, I feel like there are thousands of businesses around the world that have similar structures are what you're dealing with. Google knows that, so there has to be a solution somehow. Can you create ppc specific landing pages for that one insurance agent? on a subdomain...would that violate any rules?",

That's the answer to your question.\n\n\\*You didn't mention landing page, but using page referrer would be mixing apples and oranges.  If a user's previous page (referrer) is outside your domain, they will still have a entrance or landing page inside.  Plus, referrer is a value that is easily lost by misconfigurations, so it might be blank in a number of situations.\n\n\\*To best illustrate the answer, I suggest the following exploration:\n\nDimensions: Page Path plus Query string, Landing page  \nMetrics: Total Users, Sessions, Views, Entrances  \nAdd a Filter on the page in question...use \"contains\"...remove hostname and any query parameters.\n\nThe first row under totals is most likely those who visited the page AND entered there.   The remaining rows explain the views for those who didn't.    Users and sessions help explain audience size and if they come back.     Page reloads or page refreshes is not an easy metric to get; but it shouldn't be a major factor anyways.\n\n\\*Start with Landing Page, then try referrer instead, then try both.  (The report might become unwieldly with both).   Despite my comments about page referrer,  add it in and see if it adds anything with these metrics.\n\nConclusions:\n\n\\*Including users and sessions shows some aspects that many people might not think of: there might be a much smaller group of users responsible for activity, and these users might be coming back multiple times.\n\n\\*This exploration allows you to answer a number of business questions, not just the one posed here.\n\nPlease let us know how it goes!",

We plan to use BetterLinks and Analytify, with WooCommerce handling value passing.\n\nJust to confirm‚Äîthis setup can also be used to track donations, right? As long as it‚Äôs configured correctly, it should technically function like a purchase. We‚Äôre also planning to track this from different countries but only using 1 GA4 property . As far as I know, GA4 compares the currency using the current exchange rate set in GA4. Right?\n\nRegarding BetterLinks, we‚Äôre using it for affiliate links and link shortening. It provides a dashboard in WordPress and utilizes the GA4 API key. I‚Äôve already confirmed that it does not pass data to GA4 but instead collects data and displays it in the WordPress dashboard. However, my concern is whether using a shortlink would classify the traffic as a referral, potentially causing issues when identifying the actual source.\n\nI‚Äôd appreciate your insights on this, as well as any recommendations for tracking donations.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

I also want to hear what has worked and what hasn't for you guys.\n\n# 1. Building CEO's profile instead of the brand's, WORKS\n\nI noticed that many company pages on LinkedIn with tens of thousands of followers get only a few likes on their posts. At the same time, some ordinary guy from Mississippi with only a thousand followers gets ten times higher engagement rate.\n\nThis makes sense: social media is about people, not brands. So from day one, I decided to focus on growing the CEO/founder's profile instead of the company's. This was the right choice, within a very short time, we saw dozens of likes and thousands of views on his updates.\n\n# 2. Turning our sales offer into a no brainer, WORKS LIKE HELL\n\nAt u/offshorewolf, we used to pitch our services like everyone else: ‚ÄúWe offer virtual assistants, here's what they do, let‚Äôs hop on a call.‚Äù But in crowded markets, clarity kills confusion and confusion kills conversions.\n\nSo we did one thing that changed everything: we productized our offer into a dead-simple pitch.\n\n**‚ÄúHire a full-time offshore employee for $99/week.‚Äù**\n\nThat‚Äôs it. No fluff, no 10-page brochures. Just one irresistible offer that practically sells itself.\n\nBy framing the service as a product with a fixed outcome and price, we removed the biggest friction in B2B sales: decision fatigue. People didn‚Äôt have to *think*, they just *booked a call*.\n\nThis move alone cut our sales cycle in half and added consistent weekly revenue without chasing leads.\n\nIf you're in B2B and struggling to convert traffic into clients, try turning your service into a flat-rate product with one-line clarity. It worked for us, *massively*.\n\n# 3. Growing your network through professional groups, WORKS\n\nA year ago, the CEO had a network that was pretty random and outdated. So under his account, I joined a few groups of professionals and started sending out invitations to connect.\n\nEvery day, I would go through the list of the group's members and add 10-20 new contacts. This was bothersome, but necessary at the beginning. Soon, LinkedIn and Facebook started suggesting relevant contacts by themselves, and I could opt out of this practice.\n\n# 4. Sending out personal invites, WORKS! (kind of)\n\nLinkedIn encourages its users to send personal notes with invitations to connect. I tried doing that, but soon found this practice too time-consuming. As a founder of 200-million fast-growing brand, the CEO already saw a pretty impressive response rate. I suppose many people added him to their network hoping to land a job one day.\n\nWhat I found more practical in the end was sending a personal message to the most promising contacts AFTER they have agreed to connect. This way I could be sure that our efforts weren't in vain. People we reached out personally tended to become more engaged. I also suspect that when it comes to your feed, LinkedIn and Facebook prioritize updates from contacts you talked to.\n\n# 5. Keeping the account authentic, WORKS\n\nI believe in authenticity: it is crucial on social media. So from the get-go, we decided not to write anything FOR the CEO. He is pretty active on other platforms where he writes in his native language.\n\nWe pick his best content, adapt it to the global audience, translate in English and publish. I can't prove it, but I'm sure this approach contributed greatly to the increase of engagement on his LinkedIn and Facebook accounts. People see that his stuff is real.\n\n# 6. Using the CEO account to promote other accounts, WORKS\n\nThe problem with this approach is that I can't manage my boss. If he is swamped or just doesn't feel like writing, we have zero content, and zero reach. Luckily, we can still use his \"likes.\"\n\nToday, LinkedIn and Facebook are¬†unique platforms, like Facebook in its early years. When somebody in your network likes a post, you see this post in your feed even if you aren't connected with its author.\n\nSo we started producing content for our top managers and saw almost the same engagement as with the CEO's own posts because we could¬†reach the entire CEO's network through his \"likes\"¬†on their posts!\n\n# 7. Publishing video content, DOESN'T WORK\n\nI read million times that video content is killing it on social media and every brand should incorporate videos in its content strategy. We tried various types of video posts but rarely managed to achieve satisfying results.\n\nWith some posts our reach was higher than the average but still, it couldn't justify the effort (making even home-made-style videos is much more time-consuming than writings posts).\n\n# 8. Leveraging slideshows, WORKS (like hell)\n\nWe found the best performing type of content almost by accident. As many companies do, we make lots of slideshows, and some of them are pretty decent, with tons of data, graphs, quotes, and nice images. Once, we posted one of such slideshow as PDF, and its reach¬†**skyrocketed!**\n\nIt wasn't actually an accident, every time we posted a slideshow the results were much better than our average reach. We even started creating slideshows specifically for LinkedIn and Facebook, with bigger fonts so users could read the presentation right in the feed, without downloading it or making it full-screen.\n\n# 9. Adding links to the slideshows, DOESN'T WORK\n\nI tried to push the slideshow thing even further and started adding links to our presentations. My thinking was that somebody do prefer to download and see them as PDFs, in this case, links would be clickable. Also, I made shortened urls, so they were fairly easy to be typed in.\n\nNobody used these urls in reality.\n\n# 10. Driving traffic to a webpage, DOESN'T WORK\n\nEvery day I see people who just post links on LinkedIn and Facebook and hope that it would drive traffic to their websites. I doubt it works.¬†Any social network punishes those users who try to lure people out of the platform. Posts with links will never perform nearly as well as posts without them.\n\nI tried different ways of adding links, as a shortlink, natively, in comments... It didn't make any difference and I couldn't turn LinkedIn or Facebook into a decent source of traffic for our own webpages.\n\nOn top of how algorithms work, I do think that people simply don't want to click on anything in general, they¬†WANT to stay on the platform.\n\n# 11. Publishing content as LinkedIn articles, DOESN'T WORK\n\nLinkedIn limits the size of text you can publish as a general update. Everything that exceeds the limit of 1300 characters should be posted as an \"article.\"\n\nI expected the network to promote this type of content (since you put so much effort into writing a long-form post). In reality articles tended to have as bad a reach/engagement as posts with external links. So we stopped publishing any content in the form of articles.\n\nIt's better to keep updates under the 1300 character limit. When it's not possible, adding links makes more sense, at least you'll drive some traffic to your website. Yes, I saw articles with lots of likes/comments but couldn't figure out how some people managed to achieve such results.\n\n# 12. Growing your network through your network, WORKS\n\nWhen you secure a certain level of reach, you can start expanding your network¬†\"organically\", through your existing network. Every day I go through the likes and comments on our updates and send invitations to the people who are:\n\nfrom the CEO's 2nd/3rd circle and\n\nfit our target audience.\n\nSince they just engaged with our content, the chances that they'll respond to an invite from the CEO are pretty high. Every day, I also review new connections, pick the most promising person (CEOs/founders/consultants) and go through their network to send new invites. LinkedIn even allows you to filter contacts so, for example, you can see people from a certain country (which is quite handy).\n\n# 13. Leveraging hashtags, DOESN'T WORK (atleast for us)\n\nNow and then, I see posts on LinkedIn overstuffed with hashtags and can't wrap my head around why people do that. So many hashtags¬†decrease readability¬†and also look like a desperate cry for attention. And most importantly,¬†they simply don't make that much difference.\n\nI checked all the relevant hashtags in our field and they have only a few hundred followers, sometimes no more than 100 or 200. I still add one or two hashtags to a post occasionally hoping that at some point they might start working.\n\nFor now, LinkedIn and Facebook aren't Instagram when it comes to hashtags.\n\n# 14. Creating branded hashtags, WORKS (or at least makes sense)\n\nWhat makes more sense today is to¬†create a few branded hashtags¬†that will allow your followers to see related updates. For example, we've been working on a venture in China, and I add a special hashtag to every post covering this topic.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nAs of now, the CEO has around 2,500 followers. You might say the number is not that impressive, but I prefer to¬†keep the circle small and engaged. Every follower who sees your update and doesn't engage with it¬†reduces its chances to reach a wider audience. Becoming an account with tens of thousands of connections and a few likes on updates would be sad.\n\nWe're in B2B, and here¬†the quality of your contacts matters as much as the quantity. So among these 2,5000 followers, there are lots of CEOs/founders. And now our organic reach on LinkedIn and Facebook varies from 5,000 to 20,000 views a week. We also receive 25‚Äì100 likes on every post. There are lots of people on LinkedIn and Facebook who post constantly but have much more modest numbers.\n\nWe also had a few posts with tens of thousands views, but never managed to rank as the most trending posts. This is the area I want to investigate. The question is¬†how to pull this off staying true to ourselves¬†and to¬†avoid producing that cheesy content¬†I usually see trending.",

In the past, we'd request our clients to share GA4, GSC, GTM and other account accesses to a central email, say team@domain.com. That way all of our client GA4s are in one central place and we don't have to log into another gmail account for every client, or if we want someone else on the team to quickly see the account. The downsides are account security (which we mitigate with Bitwarden), and now apparently it is a violation.\n\nOn platforms like Google Ads or Meta, it's easy to get access on behalf of our agency and assign roles that way, but GA4 doesn't have an equivalent 'Manager Account' solution so clients would have to send access to [john@domain.com](mailto:john@domain.com), [sally@domain.com](mailto:sally@domain.com), etc for every member that needed access. \n\nWhen you request GA4 access from clients, what email do they share access with? A shared email or an individual team members email? What is the best practice here? \n\nThanks. ",

Since you're using Destiny1/Modern Campus with GA4, first thing to check is if the e-commerce events (like purchase, add to cart, etc.) are properly configured in your GA4 data streams. Misconfigured events can often result in (Not Set) values. You might want to verify that the item\\_name or equivalent parameter has been correctly set up in your tagging configuration.  \n  \nFor resources outside of Google, looking into forums or communities dedicated to Modern Campus or those specializing in GA4 might be helpful. Sometimes these platforms have robust discussions and shared experiences that can offer solutions. If there's a particular tagging/debugging tool that comes with Destiny1/Modern Campus, digging into that might reveal more specific insights about where things could be going wrong.  \n  \nI'm Dhruv who works at StatsPro, and you might consider using it to get more accurate and easier-to-use insights, especially since it's super privacy-friendly and could help avoid these data headaches.

In my opinion, the campaigns are going well, there are a lot of calls and emails etc. coming in.  \nNow there is the following problem: The bookings via the booking platforms are tracked, but only 10% of them are attributable to organic traffic and another 10% to Google Ads.  \nThe other approx. 80% comes from referrals and the own website URL is specified as the referral. This means that since the booking tool does not run on the same domain, but on an external domain, Google now assigns these booking conversions to the referrals (i.e. the hotel website) instead of assigning it to Google Ads/Organic.  \nDo you think I'm right in assuming that this is where the error lies and that's why we almost only generate emails and calls as conversions via Google Ads?  \nBut if I'm right, then I wonder why some booking conversions are still assigned to Google Ads? Actually, ALL conversions should then be assigned to the referrals.  \nAnd now the most important question: Does anyone here know how to solve this problem?",

I would talk to sales at some of the paid solutions like MixPanel to see if they're a fit for you.\n\nGoogle Analytics is a great data collection tool. It usually has more of a marketing focus but it's capable of UX analysis too. The app analytics portion of GA4 is definitely the lesser used aspect of the platform though, and most of the conversation you'll see on this sub are related to tracking on websites for marketing teams.\n\nFollowing recommended setup will get anyone like 80% there in terms of collecting valuable user interactions. You'll have a lot of data points, but no answers to your business questions. A missing piece is custom measurement - like we have this goal in our experience so we need a measurement event when users reach this point. Another missing piece is the actual reports. Standard reports in GA4 are pretty trash, you're left to build your own which usually has analysts introducing yet another tool specifically for data visualization, like Looker Studio which is similar to Power BI and Tableau.\n\nIf operating GA sounds like a full-time job, yeah, I'd say that's accurate. It's a good tool for the dedicated Analyst or Analytics team.\n\nThat's why I say check in with MixPanel too. Tools like that offer more all-in-one solutions, as far as I know, and when you talk to them you'd maybe want to press them on showcasing these savings in time and effort versus a product like GA4. And if you do go with another platform, I'd still do the minimum GA4 setup and run it in parallel, because then you have it as a fallback with some data already collected.",

Or would it be worth going for a cookie less analytics platform?\n\nAny help with this would be so appreciated.\n\nThank you",

        "selftext": "I'm new to Google Analytics 4 and E-commerce websites, so configuring event tracking on my family's spirits business website has been a bit challenging. Due to alcohol sales laws, purchases are fulfilled by a third party called Barcart which operates its own e-commerce platform instead of WooCommerce or Shopify. In BarCart, I created buttons for each product that allow users to complete purchases on our website without leaving our domain. I also utilized BarCart's Google Analytics integration which made it seem like there would be no additional setup required on my end. However, purchase events are not being tracked in GA4.\n\nThe BarCart support team provided virtually no help when I asked them to help me troubleshoot this issue. I tried reaching out to some folks on Fiverr who claimed to have experience with custom e-commerce platforms, but they could not help out. I tried implementing the steps from a helpful video I found on YouTube, using a data layer in Google Tag Manager, and the trigger did not fire in Google Tag Assistant when I made a purchase. I am out of ideas.\n\nIf anyone has experience tracking e-commerce events in GA4 and wants to help, please send me a message!

You can check the click event in the debug window and look for the things that make that click unique. For example, is the click class unique to that button, click text, etc. Once you've worked out your parameters go back to GTM and set up the event using those parameters, and publish the container version.\n\nBe aware though (if I understand your question correctly) that this event will fire every time someone clicks \"Add to Cart\". This might not be a problem for you, but (and again, you know more about your situation than me) I think a better option would be to create an event that fires when people click \"Proceed to Checkout\" (or whatever your equivalent is). Or alternatively, set up the Add to Cart tag to only fire the first time someone clicks the button.",

Your repeat customers are where the money is made, especially because you havent spent additional marketing dollars to acquire them a second time compared to your first time customers.  Your marketing economics should budget in a customer acquisition cost that matches up with your numbers.  This helps you define your marketing budget, knowing your margins on your first transaction will be low or negative and you'll make those dollars back up on repeat purchases.  This is why newsletters and email lists are so important - they continue to convert on a customer base thats proven to convert for you already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the ratio of \\~15% of your transactions coming from new customers is about spot on actually.  The bigger concern is your poor conversion rate period.  It looks like you're already in the shopping behavior section of GA, but if not,  Conversions -> Ecommerce -> Shopping Behavior.  What I see is that your product views are actually pretty solid, but your add to carts suck.  Which means your checkouts and transactions will also suck.  So consider how to increase the experience of getting people to add to cart.  Is the button available on a category/home page to one-clck add to cart?  On product pages, is it high up on the product page?  Are there too many options that are confusing customers?  Is it prices?  What kind of promotional language are you running to entice users to add to their cart?  Once the product is in their cart, are you doing upsells and cross-sells?  Too many?  Do you provide flexible checkout options like guest checkout, or are you forcing people to give over too much info?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust go through that user journey.  Look into some heat mapping to understand consumers too, like Crazyegg, which can help you see what are they looking at, mousing over, highlighting, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I'd focus on \"how do I get customers to more easily add something to their cart\" right now.",

I'd store any error message that we shared as event actions and labels.   \n\n\nNow with GA4, I'm a bit. confused. There are a couple of ways I think this can be done:\n\n1. Fire an event for all error responses as an event labeled `\"error\"` with response type and message as custom parameters. \n2. Fire an event for  each action, with the error message as a custom parameter to that event. In this case you'd get events like `Field_1_filled` with a response type and response message as custom parameters. \n\nOption (1) seems like the most scalable way to track those errors to me.  What are your thoughts, tips, advice, warnings on this?   \n\n\nThanks!   \n\n\nSide note - we'll eventually start tracking these errors in our own DB as well at some point.",

The few who have no regrets went from free GA4 to paid Adobe, so there's a $100k investment that's beyond most other clients. \n\nThe reasons they changed analytics platforms: ease of use and \"grass must be greener\". These clients tended to be less active users of website analytics and found the GA4 learning curve to be too steep for their liking. Then, they'd been reading about all the alternatives during the UA to GA4 transition and figured another platform would be worth a try since they had to relearn a tool anyway.\n\nThe reasons they regretted making the shift: heavy lift to realign all internal teams to new reporting, plus creating a new method to monitor and track marketing (not always daunting, but change itself is difficult for most orgs). While they changed Analytics platforms, GAds was still their mainstay for paid traffic conversions.  The tight integration between Google products either had to be replicated with effort, required another tool to buy and learn, or simply surrendered as not feasible.\n\nBig tip: Know what you are trading off between analytics platforms.

So, you can see quickly how all clients‚Äô KPIs are pacing in one place. No need to access separate dashboards, unless more detail is needed. \n\nLastly, scorecards can be sent automatically on a recurring basis to everybody‚Äôs inbox as a quick digest of how these KPIs are pacing. The client, agency account team, and agency leaders feel good being in the loop and able to address any red items without having to spend time logging in, remembering which dashboards to look at across multiple clients, and so on. \n\nPlus, huge time savings from manually pulling and arranging all this data into nice charts over and over again. Once the workflow and visualizations are built in Databox, you‚Äôre done.  \n\nTo be fair to GA4, I hate it haha but we even run CRM, email, Amplitude and many other tools through Databox because it has so many integrations and can combine data from multiple sources into one visualization. For example, a buying funnel chart showing website visitors down to closed - won deals. \n\nI‚Äôve become a big believer in using CRM to store and organize data and using a separate reporting/visualization tool to create, automate and keep stakeholders informed. It‚Äôs crazy how many times I‚Äôve seen companies spending a fortune on Salesforce that can‚Äôt tell you basics like avg. days in each sales opportunity  stage and still build 90% of their reporting in Excel. Instead, invest in a cheaper CRM that intuitively stores and organizes data. Use the savings to invest in a visualization tool that reduces time and even automates chart production and stakeholder communication.  \n\nAnyway, went off on a tangent there beyond GA4 lol but if you‚Äôre still with me I feel like all these systems are connected.

It's helped us understand which products people want vs. what people will actually purchase. Very helpful for pricing and updating sales copy on the page.\n\n\\~Heatmaps are awesome.

Ownership loves this feature. It gives them the ability to watch how individual people proceed through the site by individual session based on entry page.

We then told our boss who immediately helped us patent the idea.  The company did end up building it out - much larger than we'd ever planned.\n\nMy plan was something simple and lightweight - kinda like what your tool does. But in the end they wanted more complex reports and that ultimately caused the end of the project because it got too complex for even a 1/2 dozen developers to maintain.

If I hired someone to do the drilling in GA4, At the end, I'd likely have to settle with \"your assets need improving\" product no good. Hire my AdWords buddy and we'll both get it working -type terminology. \n\nInstead,  now, I switch over to Goat counter and I can very quickly see that the landing pages of the AdWords campaign are not registering like the CTR AdWords makes it out to be. Done in 5 min. \n\nWe relook at AdWords and make sure conversions are set up correctly, and or move on to something else. \n\nI get there are people out there that know GA 4 better than I ever will. I remember in GA3 when courses were being offered thinking I might become one of those people. But, I chose not to due to issues like this. I just think it's convoluted and set up for industry speak reports, and the folk that trained in them. In 2025 and 20 years in the game, I'm just looking for results and facts, not GA speak üòÑ\n\nAgain, I'm not knocking the people who know GA inside out. But for my ROI it's one sided. At best I see GA being what large corporations use, much like MS teams. While the rest of us use something more user friendly.",

The custom events have gotten out of hand with a custom event firing for different clicks, rather than one click event firing with a detailed payload. The same is happening for page views and other generic events. We are planning to migrate to a new platform and have an opportunity to build out a potentially better solution. Coming from an engineering background, I feel like our custom events are WAY over-engineered, but I'm not a tagging expert. I just think that there must be a way to implement basic tracking that sends all of the necessary information to google analytics, so that an analyst can filter the data to get the insights they need, rather than waiting on us to build out a new custom event with extremely specific parameters.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions for resources on best practices for implementing/enhancing basic events for ecommerce?

I would recommend using GTM for reasons that have been discussed already. \n\nI just wanted to say that you‚Äôre asking the right questions as you approach a website redesign, while potentially moving to a different CMS too. My advice - and I wish I had been more disciplined about this part  - create a well organized Measurement Plan that documents everything that you will be tracking. You shouldn‚Äôt be the only person answering that question though - gather feedback from stakeholders from all levels and departments.\n\nResources - I suggest using a Google Sheet template that organizes your implementation from beginning to end. Share it with other stakeholders so everyone is on the same page in 2-3 months (or whenever the new website and tracking are completed) so everyone is held accountable, and more importantly everyone is on the same page. \n\nYou can find implementation templates on Analytics Mania, MeasureSchool, DumbData (underrated resource), or just make your own. I can DM you one if you‚Äôd like. These event planning documents will help you determine if you need 1 click event with 5-10 event parameters, or 10 click events with 1-2 parameters. I almost always lean towards the former rather than the latter. But every situation is unique and sometimes the latter is the right solution. \n\nLastly, check out Orbit Media‚Äôs blog, in particular the post about tracking website redesigns in GA4. I share that blog post every chance that I get because of how helpful it is to have a guide during a hectic transition period - it will help keep you on track. \n\nGood luck!",

Identifying and eliminating PII is part of any holistic analytics audit for a reason, and If recent legal precedents around User consent to collect data are any indication, even attempting to track non-anonymous User activity is only getting to get harder and more radioactive.\n\nHow are you currently identifying the user in GA4 to determine that you're not seeing the data you're expecting? Does your User log in and have an ID that you've connected to the User? Are you using the User Explorer report in GA4 somehow to determine the data aren't correct?\n\nI'd need to know more about your tracking - and especially how you're identifying the User - to help much, but if you're able to identify the user via the dataLayer, the best way to track a User's activity would be BigQuery I think.

This is puzzling because:\n\n* Default Dimension Works - The Session source/medium in the default GA4 reports correctly attributes traffic as cpc.\n* Manual Dimension Issue - However, the **Session manual source/medium dimension** often **defaults to organic** even on landing pages where **we expect cpc**.\n* What makes this stranger is that our organic traffic isn‚Äôt manually tagged with source=google and medium=organic, so it‚Äôs odd that this would appear in the manual source/medium for our paid landing pages.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone else seen the Session manual source/medium dimension default to organic in GA4, especially in cases where organic traffic isn‚Äôt manually tagged?\n2. Are there any known fixes or workarounds within GA4 to address this problem?\n3. Would relying more on BigQuery for session reconstruction be a more reliable approach, or is there a solution within GA4 that we might be missing? If so what are the steps here?\n\nThanks for any insights or advice you can share!",

The activity before login would be assigned to the link (correct) landing page, but would obviously end at login, so revenue wouldn't attribute.\n\nAfter that, it's a little ambiguous; I've never heard of a scenario where the homepage was arbitrarily assigned as Landing Page for direct sessions begun on the site. In the login scenario, Landing Page would report as (not set), as technically there is no Landing Page - the session was initiated internally on the site. All that said, Google reports that if page view events aren't getting necessary URL data, GA4 may attribute Landing Page to the homepage (as you're seeing possibly). Incidentally, I looked at some Landing Page reporting and found more Landing Page - Homepage than I expected for a specific campaign as well.\n\nRe: a fix, based on Google's diagnosis of page view issues, I'd check out how you're sending page view events (i.e., either via Google Tag or standalone event tag), and then in GTM preview mode make sure the URL data is available in the dataLayer when page views actually fire, paying special attention to the page following login (i.e., login success)...oh, is your login page an single page/progressive web app by chance? Those often breed page view tracking issues. While you're there, also check you're not creating a new session at login. It also might be interesting to check out the few pages that are attributing correct Landing Page to see if page view or other events are firing in a different order (again, in GTM preview mode).

It's the Audience Export that I cannot do. The only thing that I found on Audience Export [was this one](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/issues/12802) , which did not work. In particular, in the comments it explains how to create audience_export, which works until the operation part, but it still does not work. In particular, if I try the code that he provides initially(after correcting the AudienceDimension field from name= to dimension_name=), I take \nTypeError: Parameter to MergeFrom() must be instance of same class: expected <class 'Dimension'> got <class 'google.analytics.data_v1beta.types.analytics_data_api.AudienceDimension'>.\n\nSo, here is one of the 6 code samples(the credentials are inserted already in the environment with the os library):\n\nproperty_id = 123\n\naudience_id = 456\n\nfrom google.analytics.data_v1beta.types import (\n\nDateRange,\n\nDimension,\n\nMetric,\n\nRunReportRequest,AudienceDimension,\n\nAudienceDimensionValue,\n\nAudienceExport,\n\nAudienceExportMetadata,\n\nAudienceRow,\n\n)\n\nfrom google.analytics.data_v1beta.types import GetMetadataRequest\n\nclient = BetaAnalyticsDataClient()\n\n# Create the request for Audience Export\n\nrequest = AudienceExport(\n\nname=f\"properties/{property_id}/audienceExports/{audience_id}\",\n\ndimensions=[{\"dimension_name\": \"userId\"}]  # Correct format for requesting userId dimension\n\n)\n\n# Call the API\n\nresponse = client.get_audience_export(request)\n\nThe sample code might have some syntax mistakes because I couldn't copy the whole original one from the work computer, but again, with the Core Reporting code, it worked perfectly.

My colleague is convinced that 'Explorations' are Google's poor attempt to rip off Adobe Analytics. Apparently, nobody uses Adobe built in reports, either. My theory is that they're tired of supporting the platform and want to push GA, for all intents and purposes, towards those able to report out of Big Query. The platform is there for occasional users to grab a few quick metrics, but not for any real, efficient reporting. That there are no unsampled reports - at any price - available in the platform says a lot IMO. It also may be that enterprise web analytics are happening more and more via API (R, Python, etc.). I, for one, hate using either interface and want out of that type of workflow ASAP. It feels more and more lethargic clicking around a website to get what I need.\n\nI won't be surprised to see more UA functionality come back in coming months - especially in the standard reports, but the architecture and dimension/metric set is what it is, and I don't understand why they couldn't build on the previous set instead of reinventing them.\n\nIMO, GA4 events' flexibility (inclusion of more parameters) is a significant improvement over UA's archaic Category, Action, and Label.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that there weren't even going to be sessions in GA4, and as of last month, Google Signals is already gone. They're flailing. They'll either cave and start reintroducing UA-ish (or new, better) functionality or GA will die. GA going away seems very possible considering there's not even a paid service tier anymore. Currently, GA only makes money via warehousing/BQ/GCP, right?\n\nIt also seems possible that personalization and user journey platforms (like Full Story, Contentsquare), and their built in analytics, may be ramping up to replace a lot of what bigger businesses/orgs have relied on GA for in the past, and maybe Google knows that. GA4 may just end up there for basic site function reporting and whatever you can dream up using BQ.\n\nOne thing I do know is that I'm not super excited that my job relies on Google apps anymore. I never was, but it feels more and more sketchy all the time.",

A user scans the QR code, their phone decodes a string, which in this case is a web address, it passes the address to the default browser, and the browser treats it no differently than if user had typed it in. Only when the page is loading does GA enter the equation ‚Äî everything upstream is outside its perspective. You can research best practices for QR codes, but at a minimum you want a dedicated URL in the QR and/or campaign attributes appended (often this is done via a redirect from the shortened dedicated URL in the QR code), associating the entrance in GA with your campaign. Note that the latter bit is not foolproof ‚Äî a user can always reshare a campaign URL some other way ‚Äî but leveraging a redirect in the QR code link will make sharing of that dedicated vanity URL less likely, since user would be less likely to see the actual QR link URL",

That's the best way I've seen so far to buck the Google Analytics is inaccurate and therefore useless vibe.\n\nRe: aggregating to a city, Amazon and Google have large data centers in those cities, and you're just seeing that tech. Ashburn, VA, for example...more sessions in a day than the entire city population? Hmmm. 100k sessions from that city of 20k people in Eastern Oregon? :-)\n\nRe: narrowed down to a set up, I'm pretty sure those machine configurations are virtual machines, and my experience is that the largest bot traffic spikes usually hide in plain sight with those weird configurations. Sometimes a bot spike is part of an SEO audit, too (i.e., an intended bot crawl that has no intention of hiding). In my experience, it's nothing more than a nuisance, really. There's nothing exciting about it. Except maybe when a competitor scrapes your site for pricing analysis...which is illegal I'm pretty sure.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm not as skilled in Google Analytics, but I'm trying to learn. I'd appreciate insight on if what I suggest below is a good workflow and then what actions I would take to make it happen.\n\n**Here's the situation:**\n\nWith GA4, I noticed that the out-of-the-box set up doesn't do a great job of highlighting social media metrics. Since I am also responsible for our social media program at my company, I'm interested in creating a more customized view that better shows the data in a way that highlights social media metrics. I want to customize the metrics on the reports as well as apply filters to the report to more clearly see the impact social has on our website's traffic. \n\n  \n**What I'm thinking:**\n\nIn the past, when I've applied filters to Universal Analytics, it messed up the reporting streams for other metrics we were looking at. I'd rather keep my social-specific view separate so that I'm not jeapordizing any other data within our GA4 property. This said, I'm thinking of creating a duplicate property in GA4 that matches our current one, but allows me to track social-specific metrics and apply filters. \n\n  \n**The question:**\n\nAm I going about this the wrong way or is this a good way to think about how to track our data? Again, I'm new at this so I'm unsure about what the right workflow looks like. Any thoughts are appreciated.",

How do other analysts or ad techs analyze facebook ad spends relative to revenue/leads/etc in GA4 when the only view seemingly available is campaign level?

        "selftext": "Has anyone run into issues when filtering internal IP addresses from GA4 by including a range through CIDR notation? I've had two clients provide IP ranges through this method, and when I've had them test it, I cannot identify any users or sessions being picked up through that filter (I've waited the appropriate 24-48 hours before testing).   \n  \nThe attached screenshot is what I see when trying to add the test filter. Is it worth the risk to just move the filter to active even without a viable test? Any insight into this would be greatly appreciated!

If you aren't seeing anything show up at all, I would check that your filter parameter value matches the traffic\\_type value that you set on the rule. That's a common mismatch that I see. If that is set up correctly, ask your client to add the Google Analytics UTILS Chrome Extension, turn on debug mode, and then get them to visit the site while you watch in the DebugView and see if the traffic\\_type parameter shows up for you. If it doesn't, then check your filter rules because something isn't quite right there.",

GA4 basic setup will track more than page_view, but check if it works like you would expect. Use recommended event_names... Reuse existing parameter names before creating new custom parameters. Use snake_case for custom event and parameters... It looks cooler and more consistent. \n\nGood luck!",

Google have stated (again through the 3rd party) that their API uses some kind of additional algorithm on top of the (other) aggregation to speed up requests and their accuracy threshold for this is 5% (which implies a degree of inaccuracy is expected in all reports). It feels like this will be something to do with it.\n\nHonestly the fact this is so unclear in the first place is a major failing of Google. My sneaking suspicion is that internally ga4 is considered beta or even alpha so three are considered bugs to be ironed out in future releases. Absolutely no way to confirm this though",

        "selftext": "Since launching a new version of my site, engaged sessions are down from 65% to 50%. I redesigned the website to provide customers with the information they are looking for on the front page, instead of having to navigate around multiple pages. \n\nI looked into how GA4 calculates what an 'Engaged Session' is. I understand that it's if somebody checks multiple pages, or spends >10 seconds on my website or has an 'engagement event'. \n\nSo, here is my question: How does GA4 calculate how long somebody is on my site if they ONLY use the front page. I wanted to get folks to use the front page and not have to go to a 2nd page or do anything. So, is my lower engagement rate an endorsement of my new site?",

                "body": "GA4 is smart enough to be able to calculate time on site even if a user bounces without doing anything because it sends a ping when the browser tab loses focus. This is different to how GA360 did it, which would register 0 seconds if a user bounced without triggering any events. As a result the GA4 time on site numbers are much closer to reality than older version of GA, as the averages used to be way off with all the zeros throwing everything off. \n\nThings i would check:\n\n* Check the time on site metric to see if it has changed before and after the site redesign.\n* If the time on site hasn't changed, check which events do you have set as conversion event. Perhaps the old site had something random tagged as a conversion event, inflating the engagement rate. \n* Have you controlled for any changes in traffic source? Are you running any campaigns to promote the new site (e.g. Social) that might have a lower engagement rate that could skew the results. Many paid sources have lower engagement rate than organic sources.\n\nIt might also just be the case that you've made stuff easier to find on the site, thus more people are able to get what they need without visiting multiple pages or staying longer than 10 seconds. This isn't necessarily a bad thing.",

The files are generally small, but receive hundreds or even thousands of hits on some days. So the issue becomes more about transfer speeds or limits via a URL, ease of management, simple URLs for linking, and importantly at least some simple analytics such as number of downloads per file, etc. I should say we are based in the US (mid-west) and 95%+ of our internet file requests would be US based.\n\nCurrently we are using AWS S3 storage but this seems expensive and overly complicated for our needs, especially getting simple analytics. We have a few hundred files, totaling around 800MB, that needs good download response to US based clients, simple management interface, and simple URL structure, with some level of analytics.\n\nAny thoughts or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",

There are groupings of webpages (6-8 webpages per group) that I'm wanting to isolate and get user data about, and I'm just trying to figure out the best way to go about doing that.\n\nUltimately, my goal would be to run an analytics report in Google sheets every Monday morning about the previous week's traffic for these groups of pages. I've already set up configurations in Google sheets for all pages for All Users and New Users, so I'm thinking that I have to segment the users that visit these groups of 6-8 pages specifically.\n\nI've managed to create the reports that I want within GA4 itself. I've set up a segment for each grouping of webpages, page title is my dimension, page view is my metric, and it's giving me a line graph where each webpage is a line so that I can see the traffic over time. And that's what I want!\n\nMy main question is: is there a way that I can run this report in Google Sheets? I've looked at the segment dropdown in the \"Create Report\" sidebar and looked for my newly created segments, but they aren't there. Am I not understanding segmenting correctly? Should I just stick to my reports in GA4? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!",

        "author": "UptonDogW",

        "selftext": "In the old UA API, we were able to retrieve unsampled metrics on how many pageviews and unique users we had on various pages/paths on our site.  So for example we could say, give me the pageviews for each date from June 1st to June 30th, for the following paths:\n\n/users/303\n\n/users/304\n\n/users/305\n\nThe way we used to do this in the UA API was to say, \"give me the metrics for all paths that begin with /users/\". And then we would loop through the results, and make a second request for the next page of results if needed.\n\nBut in the new GA 4 API we are running into sampled data issues whereby the response is always including the following metadata:  data\\_loss\\_from\\_other\\_row: true\n\nThe quality of the sampled data, for this particular purpose, is terrible. We have tens of thousands of URLs / paths, and if a given path had 10 pageviews, I want to know it was 10 and not some essentially random number like 0, 2, or 17.\n\nI have seen some questions on this Reddit about topics like this, such as this one:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/11aiedo/anyone\\_else\\_experiencing\\_the\\_ga4\\_api\\_being\\_way/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/11aiedo/anyone_else_experiencing_the_ga4_api_being_way/)\n\nBut I'm still uncertain and confused if what I am trying to achieve is possible:  Even if I narrow down my API query to only be:\n\n\\- dimensions: just 1 date\n\n\\- metrics: just 1 metric (pageviews or unique users)\n\n\\- filters: pagePath, \"EXACT\" match type, for a given, single path string\n\n... Is there no reliable or known way to get unsampled data out of the API?  E.g. just tell me how many pageviews there were for a given path on a given date. Even if I have to make 5,000 API calls for each path instead of batching them together.  Any ideas?",

I'm trying to look at what pages users visited and flow through before triggering a conversion event on a website (Event being a form being filled).  \nSo I'm using Path Exploration on GA4 with the ending point set as that particular conversion event. It successfully shows me the various pages and event counts for those pages before we reach the desired event.  \nNow here's the struggle. In the settings of the report, the metric for the values is Event Count. I want to change it to Total Users (or event active users). For the life of me, I have tried everything, but each time I try to change the value to either total users or active users, I get this response -  \n\"No data for this combination of segments, values, filters, and date range. Try editing the variables or settings or remove them.\"  \nSo we are only seeing event counts in the flow instead of a user count across the pages till the event is triggered. At wit's end here, kind folk. Maybe I am being supremely dense and the answer is right in front of me OR google hasn't yet added such a feature to path exploration Reports.  \nAny help is very welcome. Thank you, kind people.  \nTL:DR - Don't know how to tldr, but simply put, path exploration is not letting me change event count metric to total users for a report where I am trying to understand the pages visited on a site before a specific event is triggered.\n\n&#x200B;",

I'm trying to look at what pages users visited and flow through before triggering a conversion event on a website (Event being a form being filled). \n\nSo I'm using Path Exploration on GA4 with the ending point set as that particular conversion event. It successfully shows me the various pages and event counts for those pages before we reach the desired event. \n\n**Now here's the struggle**. In the settings of the report, the metric for the values is Event Count. I want to change it to Total Users (or event active users). For the life of me, I have tried everything, but each time I try to change the value to either total users or active users, I get this response - \n\n>\"No data for this combination of segments, values, filters, and date range. Try editing the variables or settings or remove them.\"\n\nSo we are only seeing event counts in the flow instead of a user count across the pages till the event is triggered. At wit's end here, kind folk. Maybe I am being supremely dense and the answer is right in front of me OR google hasn't yet added such a feature to path exploration Reports. \n\nAny help is very welcome. Thank you, kind people. \n\nTL:DR - Don't know how to tldr, but simply put, path exploration is not letting me change event count metric to total users for a report where I am trying to understand the pages visited on a site before a specific event is triggered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

We‚Äôve run into a reporting issue in GA4 these past 2 weeks with one client that we cannot seem to figure out. This client runs 2 responsive display campaigns in Google Ads; these have been running since May and have picked up decent performance. The utm parameters on these ads are source=display, medium=cpm. However, we recently found out that traffic has been recorded since campaign launch as Paid Search, with google / cpc as the session source / medium. It‚Äôs important to note that this client does not and has never had ANY search ads running, neither in Google nor Bing. We looked in the traffic acquisition report in GA4, and there is only a handful of data getting recorded since May as Display with the correct parameters. A majority of their traffic acquisition report is Paid Search. We also checked on the real-time report in GA4 upon clicking the ad, and that source / medium is being recorded as google / organic! Has anyone also had this problem before, or have a suggestion on what else we can look into or what this may be? Thanks in advance!",

In short, I didn't try to create a \"faux\" variable in GTM to have it mimic the existing utm data gathering. Honestly, not worth the time, given I assume google will eventually bring that into the connector by default.\n\nAs for capturing and reporting UTM term and content in GDS, you need to create your custom variable in GTM that targets the URL query of the UTM name. Then you can create an event in GTM that passes the new event parameters to GA4 as custom. This tag will be triggered by a view on all pages.\n\nYou just need to be sure to create these custom dimensions in GA4 so that GTM can populate it with the info it finds. In my version, I created a custom event for it as well, but I believe you can always just associate the custom dimensions with an existing event in GA4 that makes sense.\n\nHappy to explain further or share screenshots if it helps.",

We have all those ads driving traffic to a no-index page (you only get there if you know the URL directly) set up just for that campaign.\n\nThe ad company is showing on their dashboard something like 1100 clicks to our website.  Our analytics (GA3) is only showing 280 visits to that page.\n\nThe company's response to the discrepancy is:\n\n>With¬†***In-app advertising***, ads are appearing within a mobile app like Weatherbug or ESPN, and upon click links out to your website, one of the two things occur:\n\n1. It will take the user out of the¬†In-App environment¬†and launch a web browser ‚Äì In some cases, UTM parameters are stripped, which causes breakage in tracking or if the web-view does not accommodate all the necessary SDK parameters to emulate a website, it can break the tracking.\n2. Second, it will launch a native browser, which emulates a mobile-web environment within the app, and in some scenarios the post click engagement are tracked. But, when user exits out of the native browser, user is still in the app. The shortfalls of this are: (1) a cookie doesn‚Äôt get dropped at time of impression, and (2) if they do click, a cookie is dropped, but only for that in-app browser session.\n\nI don't feel like this would affect the basic page views statistic? We're not tracking via special UTMs or anything like that. Just looking at the pageviews/visits to that private landing page.\n\nAm I missing something or are they trying to blow smoke?",

                "body": "That‚Äôs a very common and frustrating issue.\n\nIt can definitely be alarming to see such a huge drop-off in the audience size between Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Ads, especially going from 215 down to just 8 for a Display campaign.\n\nThere are a few key reasons this discrepancy happens, and they mostly boil down to differences in how the two platforms define and track a \"user\" and restrictions on who can be remarketed to.\n\nThe most important factor here is that the GA4 audience count (215) represents all users who met your audience criteria on your site, based on first-party data and whatever tracking methods you have in place.\n\nThe Google Ads audience count (8 for display) is only the remarketable portion of that group.\n\nGoogle Ads can only serve ads to users it can definitively match to a Google account or an advertising cookie/ID, and who haven't opted out of ad personalization.\n\nUsers are excluded from the Google Ads list if: they've denied consent for ad personalization, they‚Äôre using an ad blocker that prevents the Google Ads tracking from firing, they don't have a Google account logged in, or Google can't match their device/browser to a profile for privacy reasons.\n\nFurthermore, for Display campaigns, Google Ads requires a minimum audience size of 100 active users in the last 30 days to actually serve ads, so a count of 8 means the list is too small to be used for targeting at all.\n\nThis kind of discrepancy is only going to become more pronounced as browser privacy restrictions, like the planned deprecation of third-party cookies, increase.\n\nTo combat this data loss and improve the accuracy and size of your audiences in Google Ads, a great solution is to implement the Google Ads Conversion API (also called the Google Ads server-side tagging).\n\nBy sending conversion data directly from your server to Google Ads, you bypass most of the browser restrictions that limit client-side tracking (like ad blockers and cookie-blocking features).\n\nYou can effectively implement the Google Ads Conversion API using a setup involving Google Tag Manager (GTM) for server-side tagging, possibly in conjunction with a service like Stape.io to manage the server-side environment.\n\nThis allows you to process and send events like `purchase`, `add_to_cart`, or your custom Standard Events directly to Google Ads and GA4, resulting in more resilient, accurate data collection for both conversions and audience building, ultimately helping to close that gap between your GA4 and Google Ads audience sizes.",

Maybe we are missing something?\n\nThank you ahead of time for your help!\n\nHere is the code for review:\n\n    <script>\n    (function () {\n       var GA_TRACKING_ID = 'xxxxxx';\n       function processMessage(event) {\n           console.log('processMessage: Received event:');\n           console.log('event.data:', event.data);\n           console.log('event.origin:', event.origin);\n           if (event.data.includes('\"name\"')) {\n               console.log('Received alert for mobile page', event);\n           }\n           else {\n               if (event.data.startsWith('R_')) {\n                   // GTAG.js methods\n                   // Maps 'dimension1' to 'response_id'.\n                   gtag('config', GA_TRACKING_ID, {\n                     'custom_map': {'dimension1': 'response_id'}\n                   });\n     \n                   // Sends a response_id event.\n                   gtag('event', 'ev_response_id', {\n                       'response_id': event.data,\n                       'non_interaction': true\n                   });\n                   console.log('Pushed response_id : ' + event.data + ' to Google Analytics.');\n               }\n           }\n           console.log('processMessage: end');\n       }\n     \n       function setSessionId() {\n           var sessionIdName = 'ua_session_id';\n           var noFirstVisit = sessionStorage.getItem('noFirstVisit')\n           // this is the first time\n           if (!noFirstVisit) {\n               var sessionId = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 10);\n               gtag('config', GA_TRACKING_ID, {\n                 'custom_map': {'dimension2': sessionIdName}\n               });\n               gtag('event', 'ev_session_id', {\n                   'ua_session_id': sessionId,\n                   'non_interaction': true\n               });\n               console.log('Pushed ' + sessionIdName + ': ' + sessionId + ' to Google Analytics.');\n     \n               sessionStorage.setItem('noFirstVisit', true);\n           } else {\n               console.log('The user already saw this page.')\n               // close and reopen the tab to clear the session storage\n           }\n     \n       }\n     \n       window.addEventListener('message', processMessage);\n       setSessionId();\n    })();\n    </script>",

I have some very basic conversion and event tracking enabled on her site, which includes  \n\n\n\\- \"Thank You\" page 'destination' conversion set up on Google Analytics for when people submit her website contact form and are redirected to her Thank You page URL.  \n\\- Event Tag (Click trigger) - for both when her email is clicked or phone number is clicked on her website  \n\n\nEverything fires and tracks perfectly during my testing on desktop. I've function tested it using the Tag Assistant chrome extension and checking the actual GA reports. Where it gets weird is on Mobile:  \n\n\n\\- Event tags (eg. email clicked) fires correctly and shows up in GA correctly\n\n\\- The \"Thank You\" page destination goal conversion does NOT (works fine on desktop)  \n\n\nSo essentially, she's gotten several Website Contact form submissions that are not tracked in Google Analytics and we don't have any data on those \"conversions\". It's really frustrating as we have Google Ads running for her and it's not tracking properly.  \n\n\nI've read a bit that Wix has a weird approach in which it creates a separate desktop and mobile website (rather than a true responsive design approach). I suspect this is the issue, but I do not know how to fix it?   \n\n\nAny ideas how to fix this \"Thank You\" page conversion tracking on mobile? Should I switch to a \"Submit\" button event Click instead of a destination URL? I don't like this idea as much because it can fire multiple times (eg. they don't fill out the form correctly first try) - leading to a few false positive conversions.  \n\n\nThanks for any help!",

I checked Hubspot and found that there have been 3 new contacts created via paid search. This led me to check Google Analytics (which I honestly don't use regularly). \n\nWhat I figured is this: Conversion Goals set up, as page visits (both events & destination) & PPC phone call, by an agency before me (all checked Recording = On and I've not touched anything after the handover) suddenly stopped recording conversion goals on Jan 24th. \n\nI have researched some stuff online and re-installed some tags - using the Google tag manager and copy-pasted in Site <header>  HTML (in Hubspot settings) 3 days ago. I have no coding background and I did the best I could reading Google's instructions. It is still not working - I have visited the \"destination\" URLs that GA is supposed be tracking but nothing shows up in the goal tracking graph.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I am saying that I am losing sleep over this. I have a lot riding on this campaign and if I can't prove that it is getting any conversions  - then really whats the point :( Please help!!!!
