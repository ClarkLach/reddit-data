        "selftext": "I understand there are much more efficient solutions for CMS, like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, or Adobe Commerce, and other CM Systems out there who make managing website content and offering a workflow much easier. The thing is many of those sites being built on those platforms I have noticed (say on WordPress), they are not that good or offer any quality structure options, also they can get quite complex.\n\nSo, I was wondering does custom coded CMS has any demand? How much would you pay for it?\n\nI perfectly understand that developing a CMS with pure code from scratch is quite difficult and takes a lot of time (possibly even more than a month), since I have coded my own CMS lately. But I am still curious, just conducting some small market research here.\n\nDo you find that service of any value and what's a reasonable price, you would spend for a decent, custom to your needs, CMS platform.\n\nDecent meaning: You can update and edit certain sections of the website without code. Database to store data,  User Authentication, Dashboard with website & page info, posts, views, likes, analytics and statistics, geographical user data. Blog-post editor, users board, settings. You can have schedule posts. etc.\n\nEdit: A website builder and CMS are different things. In this case, I am not talking about building websites with a CMS, just modify the content with it. Platforms like WordPress are CMS & Website builders. The idea here is: you hire someone to build you a website, and on top of it they build you a dashboard to control the content in your uniquely designed website. The architecture, structure, layout of the website will never change. You will only be able to modify the content presented on certain parts, see analytics and other stuff. No building.",

As a client, I wouldn't pay a cent unless I was a firm with millions of dollars to invest and the company building it had a very good reputation. Otherwise, I only see risks and no benefits. However, that's my subjective view; maybe someone would say, \"I'd love that idea.\"\n\nBut being tied to a developer for life, with a CMS that may or may not be good, with no UI testing (much less UX), is concerning. More importantly (and please don't take it personally, as I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of a company that may need something like this), someone who believes they have found all the issues and pain points of CMSs without any proof or testing but their subjective view.\n\nDisclaimer: I work for a UX company, hence the UX and UI remarks.",

Things dont have to be complicated and the client really dont need WP if all they need to do is update prices or something.

Drupal’s custom fields system was built by a cluster of users who’d come over from Dave Winer’s Userland Frontier” cms/web publishing tool, and it leaned heavily on complex semantic metadata rather than “bucket o-stuff” fields.

I'm not complaining as I had only 2-3 sites on my portfolio at that time, and he did give me referral to a client from which I charged around 40 USD. These offered me a good stepping stones for my next client (charged around 95 usd) and now I'm charging over 100 dollars and got immensely better at this thing. But because of my \"high\" rates in the Indian ecosystems, I have very few frequency of the clients coming in and also some do not end up publishing the site because the tech stack that I use i.e Framer, costs monthly plans which are sometimes unaffordable for my clients. I have decided to skip Indian clients and focus on international clients.\nTried Fiverr and Upwork, but the hyper competitive landscape there is killing me. I apply to a job every month on upwork through the monthly free connects that I get, but I manage to get no responses so far. I do think that my portfolio is decent and the websites I make are also pretty decent looking but ofcourse, I strive to make it better and upskill myself. I also tried cold emailing a few companies with their website revamps but got no reply. I also find this process to be unproductive as you're spending your time for revamping someone's website who might not need a revamp for a bunch of reasons, also it's unnecessary expenditure for them as most people think in the terms of \"it's okay as long as it's functioning\" and give lesser regards to design and ux. It's also hard to determine what they actually need or what their vision with the website is without even talking to them. Plus it's also difficult to determine if they would be willing to change their current tech stack.\nI have tried several different ways to find clients but have been unsuccessful in a lot of them so far.\n\nSo how and where do I actually find clients?",

I take care often but not always that the DOM order is correct, e.g. showing the heading before the image in the DOM, even though it's displayed the other way round in the DIV.\n\nIt's a difference if I can make something, or suddenly have to do it. Because this triggers me. If I get 10% or 20% more revenue because of it - fine. But if I have more work, more to consider, more troubleshooting, more communication, more problems, without any additional pay then it's a problem for me\n\nAnd as of now, my clients don't care unfortunately, and I don't want that they get the feeling that I want to \"sell\" them something just to make more money",

        "author": "Ok-Stuff-8803",
        "id": "1jzer4b",
        "selftext": "How has this continued to be a thing, and how did this get approved internally?\n\nThe Shopify Admin UI is a complete mess. It's genuinely hard to believe this shipped — and worse, that it's still the current experience, worse yet they appear to have even double down on it.\n\nLet’s start with the **lack of contextual awareness**. Navigation feels arbitrary — features and settings are rarely where you’d logically expect them to be. It often feels like the structure was designed by people who never actually *use* the platform day-to-day.\n\nThe **UI design itself is objectively poor**. Even at launch, it was hard to use — small text, cramped layout, and non-distinct buttons. And then somehow, they made it even worse. Recent updates have shrunk font sizes further and tightened spacing, making things even more difficult to parse visually. There’s almost **no visual hierarchy**. Buttons, links, and interactive elements all blend together — which is baffling considering they often do *completely different things*.\n\nThe **card layout and spacing** are atrocious. Everything is packed into narrow containers a lot of the time, likely a result of trying to optimize for tablet screens or a minimum screen width — at the cost of usability on desktop, where most admins actually work but then they change their mind in other areas and fill the screen.\n\nThe **product management pages** have become a chaotic jumble of misaligned sections, inconsistent UI patterns, and hidden settings. It’s almost hostile to workflows.\n\nWhen you switch to something like the **Analytics** section, you get a bit of UI breathing room — but then you realize that the **data is wrong**. Regularly. We've had clients come to us confused or panicked over metrics that make no sense, only for us to discover that Shopify's data was just flat-out inaccurate. We’ve had to implement Google Analytics or other third-party tracking solutions *just to get reliable numbers*.\n\nThe whole interface is also **visually dead**. Everything is grey. There’s no visual differentiation, no personality, and no cues to guide the eye. It’s not just boring — it’s inefficient.\n\nAnd don’t get me started on **basic navigation failings**. You’d think “Pages” would be part of “Content,” right? Nope. Go to the Content section, and there are no Pages. Instead, to access Pages (along with Themes and Preferences), you have to:\n\n1. Click on **Sales Channels**\n2. Wait for a **popup modal**\n3. Select **Online Store**\n4. And *then* magically, those items appear in the nav\n\nHow does that make any logical UX sense? It’s a puzzle hunt just to find basic tools. It is not as if the menu is packed with items, it is so small and packed into that top corner as if they were desperate for space when it isn't.  \nAnd finally, it is yet another company tacking in A.I features which seems completely hopeless across the board a lot of the time because it has been implemented so quick and dirty.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow developers,\n\nI’ve been working with Astro for creating websites and love its performance benefits and DX. However, I'm facing challenges with the client handoff process, especially when compared to more integrated platforms like Webflow, Framer, or WordPress.\n\n**Here’s the scenario:** When building websites with platforms like WordPress, Webflow,  etc., the handoff is straightforward — I simply transfer the project to the client's account, and they have everything in one place to manage and make updates as needed. **HOWEVER**, with Astro and most likely other modern frameworks, the process seems fragmented and potentially overwhelming for clients, especially small to medium-sized businesses.\n\nFor instance, to fully hand over a project:\n\n* Clients need a GitHub account for version control.\n* A Netlify/Vercel account for hosting.\n* An account for where the self-hosted CMS is (I am considering options like Directus or Payload to avoid monthly fees for my clients).\n* An account for the CMS itself to log in and make changes to the website.\n\nThis setup feels complex, particularly for clients who prefer owning their site without ongoing maintenance fees. They may find managing multiple accounts and interfaces daunting.\n\n**My questions to the community are:**\n\n1. Have you encountered similar challenges with modern frameworks like Astro?\n2. How do you simplify the handoff process while maintaining the autonomy and cost-effectiveness that clients desire?\n3. Are there tools or strategies that can integrate these services more seamlessly?\n4. If you've implemented custom solutions or found effective workarounds, could you share your experiences?\n\nAny insights, experiences, or advice on managing client handoffs in this context would be greatly appreciated. I'm particularly interested in solutions that could apply not only to Astro but also to other modern front-end frameworks facing similar issues.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

It's just more work than necessary, and it also means security risks as time goes.\n\nLet's face it, somebody could set up a WordPress site for a client and hand it off and be done with it, then. The client is barely touching it, but also not updating the back end when those updates pop up, and then all of a sudden you get a call a year later that their entire site got hacked and the client is angry.\n\nThe only time I ever recommend any CMS is when I know the client needs to change their content regularly. Maybe they are blogging, maybe they are doing e-commerce, or something. On top of that, I try to think about a system that this client can use. I've seen so many people set up these WordPress sites that are so complicated with plugins and other things to make the content happen, and then the client is basically bewildered on what they're supposed to do when they want to make a little change.\n\nIt's great we have all these wonderful systems out there, but I often feel in the end the web designer building something for a small or medium-sized business has to think about the end user and how they are going to be able to maintain this site. If that means you can't do every little thing you would love to do, then that's life. The big robust amazing looking websites usually have dedicated people taking care of them.",

That’s why they, for example, they still have people paying $300 a year for SSL certificates when they’ve been free for the better part of a decade (I saw this with a new client recently).\n\nThere is no shortage of articles, blog posts, social media posts outlining all of the issues with GoDaddy. I’m not the first to point it out, I won’t be the last.\n\nAnd if their business ethics isn’t enough to deter one from using GoDaddy, their founder and CEO (at the time), whose wealth is tied to Godaddy’s success was photographed trophy hunting rare animals in Africa like a psychopath about 10 years ago.

That means you are stuck with whatever design that comes from the author who created the theme. It might also come with bloated free plugins included from  the theme work just to work. \n\nThe second solution is using the modern WordPress native solution which is called full site editing. As the name says. You build your whole website on your edit. \n\nI haven't personally player around so much with it, but based on I have read on the internet, it's a bit Janky and not working as expected. It's kinda early release you could say. \n\nThe third solution is to use native WordPress Gutenberg blocks. The Gutenberg blocks is not intended to look 100% in the back end (where you edit your pages and posts) as in front end (when you publish your posts/pages) pixel perfect, but rather proof of concept which is fine. The Gutenberg Block had been around quite some time and its stable vs the full site editing which is not. You can always try and download different third party Gutenberg blocks to play around and see how it goes. Just be aware those blocks are \"generic\", so you won't get a custom/specialized block based on your needs. That requires you need to develop your own blocks, but you can overwrite the block CSS though. \n\nThe fourth solution is to use page builders such elementor, divi builder, oxygen whatever exist out there. It's not native Gutenberg blocks or full site editing, but rather their own solution that kinda have the same functionality as the Gutenberg blocks and full site Editing you could say. \n\nThe fifth solution is an old school approach where you use something called advanced custom fields where you can create custom fields and custom templates to arrange your website where you can build your own website, but It's not very intuitive to use if you aren't the person who developed the solution. \n\nPlugins or themes is required to install in order to use Elementor for example. For the native WordPress solutions, you don't need to install anything unless you want to use some kind third party Gutenberg blocks.\n\nEdit: this might be overwhelming with lots of options to choose. If you want the easiest solution, then I recommend either use Elementor or Gutenberg Blocks",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI've been doing some research to find the best platform to build a small business website that will be self-hosted for myself. But I'm having trouble finding the best solution and would like to hear some opinions from people who have compared some of the solutions. Some options I'm evaluating are 1) Hugo, 2) Jekyll, 3) Grav, 4) Ghost.\n\nI refuse to use wordpress because of security issues (they are by far the biggest target and I see on my cloudflare page attempts to exploit security holes from wordpress everyday).\n\n\nWhich one of the ones above do people recommend? Here are the things I need:\n\n***1) User management on backend + frontend login page*** (my small business will require clients to login to a page where they will have customized content tailored to them, e.g. their quarterly invoice, statements, etc).\n\n***2) Simple form to contact me*** (that's ideally hardened somewhat against spammers)\n\n***3) Ability for my assistant who is not technically capable to use a simple web interface to upload documents*** like invoices for each of the clients quarterly for the clients to download. Rest of the website will remain pretty static so no need for a fancy WYSIWIG editor since I'm technically capable and have working knowledge of HTML/CSS (but nice to have nontheless if I need to make quick edits).\n\n***4) The CMS/SSG also generates iOS/Android compatible mobile websites*** so that if someone browses the website on mobile, they can login and see the same theme.\n\n***5) Has a decent collection of off the shelf, ready made company websites*** I can work off of. I don't mind using a blog template or something and customizing it to look more like a company website if that's easy to do.\n\n***6) Free, but willing to pay a little to buy a decent theme if needed or for certain modules on a one-time basis***\n\n\nWhich of the CMS/SSGs I mentioned above best fits these requirements?",

        "author": "TheWingless1",
        "id": "jmo38w",
        "selftext": " \n\n[Early wireframe work on the Inventory Shell Menu for Wasteland 3 \\(PC, Console - inXile, Microsoft\\)](https://preview.redd.it/909ogt194uw51.jpg?width=1958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0618f4832c99122eb459f33bc833c75bfa0bb459)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh hello there, you big beautiful nerd, you! My name is John Burnett, a 20-year UI UX Designer, Art Director and 1-on-1 remote Mentor in the video game industry. **One of the most common questions students ask me is how to start a career in video game UI UX Design**. In this age of wanting to give back generously, I figured I’d take my notes from my bootcamp and compile a quick guide and a few shorthand rules for all of you with Hoop Dreams™. I’ve also taken the liberty of editing those notes into a Q & A format for easy reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Game Portfolio Design, Structure and Standards\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What’s the bare minimum I need to start applying as a game UI UX Designer?\n\n**A:** The 3 keys to the kingdom are: Marketable Projects, A Portfolio to showcase those Projects, and a Resume.\n\nMarketable Projects are the obvious must-haves to start applying, and their quality and relevancy will be *the* overriding factor in folding you in. Notice I said marketable: tonally and artistically relevant to The Company you’re applying to. We’ll talk about that a little later.\n\nYou’ll also need a way to showcase your designs to The Company. A website all your own is an expense, to be sure, but it’s also an incredible platform for any modern Designer to build upon… if your bank account allows.\n\nA Resume is an ancient holdover from the Old World, used to progress through online applications (barely more than a truckstop bathroom key at this point).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** How big should I make my game UI UX Portfolio?\n\n**A:** I always recommend 6-12 pieces with 4-6 media apiece; media meaning a potpourri of final art, icon arrays, sketches, wireframes, video - anything that *enshrines* your designs and provides authentic proof of a process. I also recommend a paragraph or two for project details and a sentence for project duties (conceptualization, wireframing, iconography, art assets, implementation through Unity/Unreal/Scaleform, etc.).\n\nIf this all sounds remarkably lean (but muh War & Peace-long case studies!) it’s supposed to be. Think about it from our perspective: no Art Director is there to hire a writer, and we’ll leapfrog to your images out of necessity or frustration; and you’d better design around the former to stave-off the latter. The dirty truth is most Art Directors have made up their minds about your skills by the time your website loads. No need to belabor the point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q**: Will non-game related Projects hurt my chances at a game Company?\n\n**A**: Just make sure there is enough variety in your portfolio for a team to make a judgement call on your shapeshifting abilities. My portfolio that got me into Midway Games was more about the presentation of my Projects, less the Projects themselves, but it worked. My Portfolio that got me into EA and id Software was much more elaborate and stylized, but still showcased a menagerie of work, not just game art - and that seemed to work too.\n\nIrrelevancy won’t hurt their opinion of you, because the idea of your chances being bent by tangential work don’t really exist. You can make a Lovecraftian portfolio that screams, “I’m unhirable, ahhh!” - absolutely. But you can also do everything right and still not get the call. My little Loves, that’s called *life*.\n\nThe truth is that a game company will hire you for one of two reasons. Either your work is hauntingly similar to the project they’re working on now - or they’re looking for a strong generalist with a kaleidoscopic body of work. That being said, your ability to work print, corporate design and websites is incidental to your ability to create game wireframes, game artwork, and implement in a popular engine. Or simply put, make sure the beer you’re pouring isn’t all foam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Applying and Interviewing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What does the UI UX Design interview process at a Game Company look like?\n\n**A:** Abandon all Hope, ye who enter here. There are 4 Gates before the burning Hells: The Frontliner, The Art Director, The Test and finally The Team.\n\nThe Frontliner can be any number of people: a recruiter, associate producer, outsource manager - their job is to vet if you’re crazy or a liar at a very early stage, as well as field details like salary expectations (you do have an answer for this, right?).\n\nThe Second Harrowing is the Art Director who will ask you far more salient questions - mostly about process and past experiences. These are generally soft-ball questions, as most game Art Directors do not specialize in UI UX Design. Unless your process is ruinously bad, you’re likely off to the next round because it’s the only part that counts in the eyes of The Company: The Test.\n\nThe Third Labor is the bane of all creatives great and small: the Art Test. Art Tests come in a rainbow-variety of forms and intensities. My Art Test for id Software was a week long and I got marauded by the flu by day 2. Got food poisoning during the interview, too - the point is, love it or loathe it, the Art Test is yet another potent way to vet if you’re crazy or a liar... and to see if your portfolio pieces are actually yours.\n\nIf you ice out anywhere, it will be after the Art Test.\n\nThe Fourth and Final Hell is… really perfunctory, to be honest. The last thing you’ll do is talk to the game team (or the small Strike Force you’ll be a part of). This is mostly to see if you and the team can acclimate for 30 minutes without somebody getting… oh, let’s call it *political*.\n\nBarring sudden-onset Tourette's, if you’re meeting with the team, it’s nothing but daylight between you and gainful nerdployment. (Though I do personally have a 1st-hand account of one gentleman who accepted a game job offer, quit our Company, moved out of his apartment and had the new Company immediately dissolve the position while the ink was still fresh and it STILL makes me laugh.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q**: It’s been a few days since I applied. How long should I wait before I move on?\n\n**A:** A week and some change. Game companies are flooded with applications all the time, the majority of which are of a… burgeoning... level of talent. When a Company receives a prospect even remotely qualified, they’ll move on it. Far too much money is at stake to wait for a Super-duper Senior when a whatever-level Designer will do.\n\nOh, and when a Company lists the job as remote-friendly but they want you to move eventually? That means they’re *only* hiring local. It’s a bold-ass, brazen-ass lie.\n\nFor your own sanity, you should gently ping The Company on the status of your application, if only to get a definitive no and move on psychologically. But if they want you, they won’t let a little thing like five workdays stop them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** I’m not even making it into the first round of talks with a Company! What am I doing wrong?\n\n**A:** Not going to lie to you, and I say this with all the gentle R&B-style love in the world: it’s all your ugly-ass projects; **they ugly!** Now, as soul-crushing as that is to hear, there are a few subtle differences between all-ugly and *mostly-ugly.*\n\nFirst, is your work modern? Can I see a blending of trends and modular improvements Industry-wide in your work? Do you know concepts like Masonry Menus, Faux-mouse interactions, and opt-in information design? Are you throwing bizarre web 1.0 photoshop filters over panels and adding glows everywhere? You don’t have to be as breathtakingly polished as the screens you drool over on Pinterest, but you know... act like you belong.\n\nSecondly, are you secretly showcasing that you’re actually a terrible engineer? An Art Director might not have an encyclopedic knowledge of what makes UX work, but they will have a jaw-dropping knowledge of technical game development. If they’re reminded of something functionally wrong, confusing, or in error (no button prompts, no back buttons, no highlight states, etc.) it sends a clear message *you’ve only been making Portfolio pieces and have* no *practical follow-through worth risking a project on*.\n\nLastly, the medium is the message. You are a part of a truly bizarre field where the presentation of information is slightly more important than the data itself. If you were a fashion designer, you better believe you wouldn’t rock acid wash jeans and an Nvidia shirt when applying to Banana Republic (apropos of nothing, my work portfolio shows nothing but blank thumbnails right now).\n\nAs a UI UX Designer in games, how you present yourself is a reflection of how you’ll present “their baby”. In this way, your Portfolio is the hidden, last Project, and, paradoxically, the first impression they will ever glimpse of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Networking, Skills and Growth\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** How should I network as a very Junior UI UX designer for games?\n\n**A:** Slowly. Networking is gardening: exceptionally few initial results with lots of maintenance which eventually blossoms into a plentiful harvest (that makes the initial investment *finally* worth it). The goal isn’t to amass the greatest numbers of followers, likes or resends. The goal is to be in front of a few people who will open doors, build bridges and otherwise sculpt the future with you.\n\nAn easy win for a new Designer is to network with other new Designers at around your skill level. You should also have treehouse-like interactions with other Creatives vying for the game industry but not in your specific field: concept, 3D, props, etc. Working on amateur projects with a real (albeit amateur) team is an amazing way to learn on-the-job skills and to imprint yourself on soon-to-be besties. Eventually your contacts will rise through the ranks, and one of them will take the rest of their friends with them on their meteoric rise. You should be that friend, if you can not flatly be that meteoric riser yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** Should I have a LinkedIn Profile?\n\n**A:** Oh my fu- YES! 3 of the 4 in-house jobs I’ve had (EA, id Software, Glu Mobile) were all the result of some wayfaring Recruiter on LinkedIn. Those were just the job offers that I took, there were dozens more because game UI UX Designers are ludicrously difficult to recruit. If you make it into the Industry, you are staffed like a unicorn; a triple-horned albino unicorn if you can evolve into a Senior. Why make it harder for people to give you a new job title and a 25% raise? In the words of the poet-laureate Tim Heidecker, “Psst… it’s free real estate.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What’s the best way to boost my skills while I wait?\n\n**A:** Make tons of personal projects. This is the method I used to build up my skills and portfolio, back in the 2000’s when we thought you had to save the life of a game designer to become one. Deconstruct okay-ish game screens you know and redesign them slightly better (or at least functionally different). Take an intellectual property that has no game and try to make one, capturing its mood and tone. Grab Unity or Unreal and learn implementation at the same time. Blog about your experiences - see one, do one, teach one. No matter what, just refuse to sit still and your skills will rise ambiently. Having them rise exponentially is… trickier (see: Mentorship below).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What books can I read to improve my UI UX skills specifically for game design?\n\n**A**: Nothing! Not a god-damn thing! There’s virtually nothing out there by way of standards, practices or process for formal video game interface design (aside from the material I’m writing since very few are volunteering). Naturally, there are resources on generic, over-the-counter UI UX Design for apps and websites. But those are blunted, padded affairs compared to the zero-point-of-failure *lethality* of video game development.\n\nIn fact, I would argue vanilla UI UX Design is like flying a cargo plane. Game UI UX is like flying an F-14 Tomcat. Maverick could *definitely* fly a cargo plane and keep it steady for hours. I seriously doubt a cargo plane pilot could hop into an F-14 and somehow just *make it happen.* Some skills translate - but not nearly enough to make you competitive, and definitely not enough to get your ass into Top Gun.\n\nGame UI UX Design is its own intense, unique thing. You absolutely must treat it as such.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What classes can I take to improve my skills?\n\n**A:** I haven’t taken any personally, and as such, I can’t in good conscience vouch for them. All my training is either self-taught or on-the-job… and that totally worked for me.\n\nThat being said, your time would be infinitely better spent with 1-on-1 over-the-shoulder mentorship than with something cold and distant - especially *these* days. Nobody is working under ideal circumstances anymore so, dear God, don’t go out in the middle of the eel-infested waters and try to do this alone. Get a damn swim-partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What kind of 1-on1 Mentorships can I take to improve my UI UX game design skills\n\n**A:** Okay now we’re talking. I broke into the game’s Industry through focus, commitment and sheer (lucking) will. But I would have much rather flourished with a warm and nurturing guide by my side. I would’ve adored some tapestry of, “No, not that red, try the maroon - it doesn’t clash with the navy background. Why not get rid of those three buttons on the side and fit them under one menu button? Your font has these razor thin lines, see? That’s going to disappear on mobile - big mistake.”\n\nFrankly, that would’ve been amazing.\n\nSo I highly recommend, in the absence of any real material on the subject, to learn from the people who are internalizing and redefining those materials every day. Grab a mentor and commit to a few months of lightspeed study. Come with project ideas, Industry questions and what you consider your own weaknesses. Independent mentors (cough cough) tend to be better in quality since they’re working professionals teaching practical skills for the love of the game, but larger mentorship programs (Springboard, IDF, RookieUp, etc.) are also chocked full of warm, generous people, too.\n\nIn the end, your Time is the only resource you will never, *ever* get back. A Mentorship, at its core, is a DeLorean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for making it *this* far in what hopefully hit the balance between a Cracked.com article and a TED talk. Like I said up top, nobody’s been writing about any of these things recently, so I’m doing my best. If you have a subject on the Industry you’d like to know more about, let me know. Love to hear what you all think. Stay safe and stay inspired.\n\n\\-John “[The Wingless](https://www.thewingless.com/)” Burnett",

I'm a visual designer of about 10 years, turned UX designer about 4 years ago. One of my referrals sounds pretty easy: making small changes to their website by moving a photo of the new owner to the top of the company's \"about me\" page. I've worked with enough content management systems to figure this out, but she might need more intensive web development next year. My skills definitely lean more towards the design side, but I have done a number of web edits and CMS training over the years at other jobs. Their site looks like it's only 6 pages and I could easily contract out some assistance from other devs if I really need to. I'm hoping to offer web development through Webflow, Wordpress, and Shopify down the road once I get reacquaint myself with those platforms, so this seems like a good opportunity.\n\nI'm thinking to charge $75/hour for basic site changes since that seems to be a pretty common average number. Does that sound reasonable? I'm in the Seattle area.\n\nAnd for pricing larger projects like an entire website, I know the general rule of thumb is to price based on how long you think it would take to complete the work. My secret hourly rate for design/web/UX work is about $160/hour, but I'm a bit unsure how long it would take me to create a 6 page website. My plan so far is to create some other fake projects to get experience.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: thanks for the silver! <3  \nEdit edit: SHE SAID YES TO THE WEB EDITS!!

He makes money by buying tractors, fixing them up, and selling them. He's great with that stuff, but he's very tech illiterate. He seems to operate fine by word of mouth but there's only so many people in our area who need tractors, y'know? He wants to be able to reach more people, so he floated the idea to me that I list his tractors on Facebook marketplace, but I don't want to do that because it would be through my account and I don't want to be the middleman, mainly because I *will* forget. So I was thinking about setting up a website for him since that would offer a way for him to receive messages directly without having to go through me, and I would just manage listings and maintenance, maybe not even maintenance if I just use a website platform. He doesn't have an email address (we are talking very old school, very tech un-savvy here), and I know that the way most websites receive correspondence from visitors is through email. My question is: is there a way to set it up so that any messages the website receives, they would go directly to my stepdad's text messages? I'm pretty sure he knows how to text, but at the very least I could specify that potential customers just need to include their phone number, and I can show him how to make calls from numbers sent in the body of a text message since that's basically child's play for someone like me who knows their way around basic smartphone functions.

Technically, there are other version control systems... but you basically just want git. In broad strokes, it's like a second save step: You work on a file, you save it to your computer, and then you save it to the git repository where it becomes the new current version. Your colleagues can then say, \"Give me the latest\" and all their files update accordingly, allowing them to continue working and stay in sync.\n\nIt's most common to use git with a centralized hosting service which everyone can then connect to. [Github](https://github.com/) is the most popular, followed by [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/), and others.\n\nIt's intimidating, but ultimately one of the most useful skills you can pick up while doing this work.

How is the image for the Hero feature supposed to scale with the various screen sizes?\n\nIs it supposed to shrink/expand with the window, or auto-resize with the window. Ie; for example I'm designing for a PC screen (various sizes), Tablet, and Mobile.\n\nAre these three separate image designs for the Hero, which all load differently depending on the device?\n\nI understand scaling the image from a browser, which shrinks with the window movement (mostly). But am I just adding the device to the Div when implementing?\n\nI apologize if this is a stupid question. I just want my hero image to scale properly, and it either gets cut-off when the window shrinks, or looks messed up on smaller devices. Any insight would be appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: After review, the easiest way to optimize images, and content in general, is to use a CDN (content delivery network). I'm sure something similar can be accomplished directly within the codebase, as many external libraries are, however- I'm seeing many advantages to researching and finding the right external library for your needs. Here's the latest snippet from my project notes.   \n\n\n**I think we're on the right track optimizing images and hosting content using the Cloudinary library. I like that they handle the respsonsiveness of the images, and they have AI for things like generating image tags, optimizing size/ scale/ etc. They also have compatibility for video, and various other content strategies. Using a CDN (content delivery network) alleviates the responsibility of having to manage this content from within the codebase itself. While it is another library to learn, we can soft-launch using Cloudinary and gradually expand on how we're using this platform to optimimze performance. Additionally, we can continue our research and evaluation of CDN's in general, ie; bunnyCDN which seems to be growing in popularity, and whereas pricing will become an important factor as content on our website continues to grow.** ",

In broad strokes, you probably want some kind of a Content Management System (or CMS) that lets you focus on writing your content and handles the display of that content for you, based off your settings and choices.\n\nSquarespace is an example of a _hosted service_. They handle all the technical details and let you pick and choose what you want to write and how it's presented. You're limited by what they offer - and have no real ability to change it - but what they offer often happens to be pretty good for a lot of folks. Other examples are wix and wordpress.com (note the \".com\" part). Squarespace tends to be on the expensive end, but folks really seem to like using it.\n\nA little more DIY is _running your own blog_ on a hosting service. This can take a few different forms, but generally involves a very similar authoring experience, but with a corresponding increase in control over the site and responsibility to keep it running. It's often cheaper in terms of dollars, but with a lot more time involved. Also, you get to learn more about how things work. Wordpress is the largest for blogging in particular, but Ghost worth looking at, and you can also look at something like Jekyll, which reduces some of the maintenance but can require a bit of coding.\n\nLastly, you can _just create plain old html_. This is essentially free in terms of cost and infinitely flexible, but takes _a lot_ more time for most people's expectations. It also gives you the most opportunity to learn how things work. That's probably more DIY than you want from your description, but worth mentioning.\n\nIt's worth looking into all three a bit - and there are infinite variations of those three categories, as I'm sure others will point out - and figuring out works for you based upon your desire to write versus your desire to learn to build a website. There's no wrong answer!",

I’m an IT person and don’t normally get involved in web stuff, but I’m doing something for a client that’s hopefully easy to achieve/answer.\n\nThey have a custom domain I’ve registered for them. They are part of a chain/buying cooperative, so their site now redirects to their site on the master/corporate site - so you enter franchisee URL, you are redirected to their corporate page.\n\nI want to create Exchange mailboxes for them, using their custom domain. I know that some NS stuff has to be done, so I am wondering if my simple redirect will work in this situation, or will the mail clients attempt to go there, and end up trying to redirect to the corporate page?\n\nWould the solution be to creat a landing page with a redirect button?",

Unfortunately the system doesn't allow for this functionality so I am creating a custom Albums menu item that would exclude those specific albums (something that I am doing through a menu plugin). But I quite like the design feature that when you are in an album's page the album's link becomes bold in the Albums menubar. It just doesn't work with my custom album.

My system then connects to this account via a GitHub App. From there, the client can modify content through the convenient interface of my system without ever needing to interact directly with GitHub. They can even add their colleagues, who might not have GitHub accounts at all.\n\nWhile the system is highly customizable, all the settings are embedded in the website code (template). Therefore, the client needs to input key values for integration with various other systems. This is why I aim to assist them in this process.",

Ideally, these platforms should offer:\n\n1. **Ease of Use:** User-friendly interface for both the administrator and customers.\n2. **Customization Options:** Ability to tailor the platform to fit specific needs.\n3. **Integration Capabilities:** Seamless integration with other tools for payment processing, customer management, etc.\n4. **Scalability:** Able to support the growth of the business.\n\nIf you've had experience building or managing a similar type of e-commerce store, I would greatly appreciate your insights. What platforms have you used or come across that might fit these criteria? Any tips on what to look for or potential pitfalls to avoid would also be immensely helpful.\n\nThank you in advance for your suggestions and advice!",

Really small company, very mis-managed, I had to occasionally work as a project manager. I had a fun variety of work but no designer above me, and I was entry level so my non-designer boss would straight up just grab my mouse and change things to actively make my designs worse when he didn't like them. Also was way underpaid. Stayed there about 3 years.\n\nSecond job was predominantly web design, but I had more of a print background than most so I would occasionally help out on that end. Company was run really well, boss was incredibly supportive and most people I worked with were great. Unfortunately the subject matter was excruciatingly boring to the point where it was bad for my mental health - basically created a cycle of me not caring, having to force myself to do work, knowing it wasn't my best work because I didn't care, trying to force myself to do better and then feeling like I couldn't make a difference because our platform didn't allow for a lot of change or testing. Stayed there for 5 years. \n\nNow onto my third and current job... back to super creative work, smaller company but big enough that I can take time off without feeling guilty. Was supposed to have a senior title coming in and a lot more of an overall design focus including both web and print, but their needs changed and now I'm a web designer/dev again. It's a lot more dev focused and a lot less design focused even though I was supposed to be designing a lot more than I am. Have my boss telling me my work is great, but one of the other bosses is seemingly never happy with my design work and seems like I'm never doing enough on the dev front for him even though I'm teaching myself new skills on a practically weekly basis. Came in on false promises that promotion would be possible, now very aware that it probably isn't. Feeling super defeated. Also, we REALLY need a project manager and it's causing so many problems that we don't have one.\n\nI hate always having to feel like a mind reader when doing work, I hate never feeling like I get a solid win in, I hate wanting to be engaged with my work and then being too invested as a result. I hate how I feel like I need to do something creative to not have my soul sucked out of me 40 hours a week, and then feeling so crappy and uncertain of what I'm doing with my life as a result. \n\nDoes anyone have a job where they feel like things are well organized, people are consistently happy with the work they're doing, and they actually feel fulfilled? This industry feels so inconsistent and so unorganized and after about 9 years I'm not sure I'm cut out for it anymore. \n\nThanks for letting me vent and I'd love to hear if anyone can relate or has any advice.",

So I want to attach a public \"key\" while retaining a private key, and it can be easily confirmed by an external public entity that I am the only one capable of generating the public key attached to my content. (I don't think that's usually how public key/private key works so I recognize this is a bit different)\n\n2. I'd like to be able implement an extremely simple password system that controls which content a visitor can view. Simple example, being if I have 10 blog posts, each person I share my website with can only access certain posts depending on the password I give them.\n\n3. I'd like to have a way to timestamp my content. The simplest way I could think of was just to attach the blog post to a twitter account.\n\nNow, for actual questions:\n\n1. Can I realistically do this stuff on something simple like Bluehost with Wordpress?\n\n2. What is the easiest solution for my goals - are there free solutions that are readily available/modular/easily deployed that don't require much html work? I don't mind if my website looks like [https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/) in terms of aesthetics, I value just the content management functionality more than form.\n\n\\-\n\nIn case anyone is curious, my goal with this isn't anything suspicious, I just want to anonymously post predictions on future events without attaching my personal identity but I want to retain an enduring system of record for it so that at any time in the future I could mathematically prove I was the author of the content. (Which wouldn't be possible if someone were to hack the website because while they can change content to prove they have control, they can never \"solve\" the previous keys attached to posted content)\n\nI know this is a LOT of ask, and I am also trying to figure out the simplest possible way to do this. I appreciate all the help in advance!",

                "body": "I think what you need to do is the following:\n\n1. For proving that you are the author of something, we usually use signatures. To generate a signature on some content you need a public/private keypair. Step one is thus to generate such a keypair, you can then publish the public key and use the private key to generate a signature over your blogpost content. Anyone with the content and the signature can verify that the signature was created by the private key corresponding to the published public key.\n2. For this you just need some kind of access control. Basic accounts will do.\n3. What you need is the following: you want to prove that you created some content somewhere in the past without sharing the content itself. You can do this by using, for example, a hash function (a one way function), which will create a short “compressed” version of the blog post content. You can then post this hash on twitter (or even on a blockchain).\n\n1. For (1), this is possible to just post on whatever platform you like, a signature is just a string of characters. For (2) you can use any access control provided by the platform you are using (so for WordPress this is just the normal accounts). For (3) you can also post this on any platform you like.\n2. I think this might be doable for free with some WordPress plugins, you can look into WordProof which is used to post post content on a blockchain.\n\nGood luck!",

Not a good idea from an SEO perspective since crawlers won't be able to access your articles. However, this is technically feasible if you really insist on doing it. You'd have the landing page be a form where users can input the password and submit the form. The form endpoint would point to a server-rendered route where you check the password, and if it's valid, you return the corresponding articles.

        "selftext": "Not sure if there’s a better sub for this so please let me know! I have been building websites for about four years, but only recently transitioned away from wysiwyg platforms and am now using design programs like figma. \n\nA little background:\n\nI don’t think I’m bad at what I do, but I’m entirely self taught. My background was in marketing and I worked my way up from marketing assistant to creative manager at my marketing agency. Everything I learned was on my own and I’ve never had anybody above me with a mastery in web design, so I know that there are significant gaps in my knowledge. Especially since I haven’t gone to school for anything remotely like this. I have a basic grasp of illustrator and Indesign and also create all the graphics for our clients as well as well as our agency. So I have a strong understanding of design principles and the basics of UI/UX best practices. To be honest, because I’m the only person in my company who does this, I’m not really sure what level I’m at. This makes me insecure, but I figure the more jobs I take on, the better all get. And I’ve had solid feedback from clients. My agency sells the sites I design for between 10k and 25k (but this includes copywriting, strategy, dev, etc). Hopefully eventually I’ll have a better sense of what I’m worth.\n\nAll this to say, I’m always trying new things by jumping in the deep end. I recently took on a couple of jobs where I’ll be designing a learning platform on WordPress. I realize this isn’t the thread for WordPress, but my question is more about how to design a platform versus a website. I don’t really know where to start and I know that there’s a lot more to think about when it comes to creating a platform where people can interact with each other. \n\nThere’s a great deal of difference between a basic five page website and an online platform where you can sign in, look at your profile, interact with others, take courses, and upload files. Where would you direct me to learn more about designing a platform? Are the design principles I’m used to going to serve me here? Or do I need to learn new basics? I care a lot about meeting expectations, so I’m prepped to learn anything in need to. \n\nAny and all advice would be so appreciated.",

        "title": "Help with choosing the right CMS for migrating a blogging community website",
        "author": "Miuchik",
        "id": "nulo9f",
        "selftext": "I'll try to keep my description short, but there is a TL;DR on the bottom of the post in case if I write too much :D I really hope to get some feedback on my issue as I've already spent a lot of time on researching the right CMS and still cannot decide which one suits me best.\n\nSo I'm working on migrating a website from a now-dead and unsupported CMS and cannot choose a new CMS. I am currently looking at Drupal, Joomla, WordPress and Ghost. I am open to other CMS suggestions if there's anything else that fits my use case better, as long as the CMS is well-supported and is not going got die within the next 5-10 years.\n\nThe website is a hobby project, so I do not expect to purchase any plugins, or at least I don't want to purchase any expensive plugins (let's say that anything that costs more than $50 flat fee is expensive). I'm willing to code though, as long as I can find proper documentation and help online. I do data science for a living, hence I have a pretty basic knowledge of web development. Anything related to pure webdev scares me more than migrating a SQL database (at least at the current stage lol).\n\nSo let me describe the website first and then I'll tell what are my current likes and dislikes about each CMS. \n\nThe website is a hobby project. It's a community blogging platform. All users can create accounts and submit their posts (these mainly contain text and images, but also sometimes embedded YouTube videos and Instagram posts). They can also comment the posts, upvote/downvote posts and comments, bookmark posts and comments, and send private messages. Users can also friend/unfriend each other, but this is not too important or used much. \n\nFirst thing that I saw when I started researching is WordPress + Buddypress. I like that the initial installation is easy and fast, but I feel like WordPress was not initially made for multi-year platforms. User access management is weird. The main thing that bugs me is that for every tiny thing I need to search for a plugin. E.g., if I just want to restrict users to seeing only their own media library or disable the ability to edit somebody else's comment under their own posts, I need to either find a working plugin or hook up filters in functions.php. These are very basic permissions, why not supply them right out of the box? I've been also reading that buddypress and any other plugins that I'll put on top of the core to reach my end goal will significantly slow down the website.\n\nThe next thing that I tried was Ghost. I really like how minimalistic it is, but it still doesn't look like a good fit for my needs. In Ghost all authors are trusted users and thus are able to inject custom js. I definitely want to disable that for regular authors. Another issue is that there in no open registration for authors, they can only be invited by email. And no private messages.\n\nThen I watched some tutorials on Drupal. It looks really promising, and I like how customizable it is. The front end is not as sleek as ghost, which I'm willing to forego in exchange for better functionality. However, I cannot find a working module for private messages and reactions to posts, so maybe the only solution is coding. Also, if I start with Drupal 9 then some of the modules that are available for 8 won't be compatible. I've seen that there is OpenSocial for Drupal 8, but it's more like a private Facebook. I only need messages, blogs, likes, comments and favorites. I don't need user activity streams and status updates. I don't know if I can easily turn off all unnecessary functionality. I've read online that D9-compatible version of Open Social will be available in ~6 months or so. If anyone has had experience working with OpenSocial please let me know what you think!\n\nAs a conclusion to my search, I started researching Joomla as well. I can see that there is a free module called Blog Factory that might suit my needs, but I don't know yet how well maintained it is. I see that there is EasySocial, EasyBlog and Jomsocial, but I'm on a tight budget. In addition, I've been seeing complaints about security issues with Joomla, so I don't even know if I need to invest in it at all. \n\nSo, at the moment, I cannot decide between Drupal and Joomla. Which CMS should I choose?\n\n**TL;DR:** I am migrating a hobby project and cannot decide on a new CMS. The site is a blogging platform where users can register, submit blog post, comment, like, and bookmark posts and comments, and send private messages. So far I've test drived/researched WordPress (overwhelmed with plugins, website may be slow with buddypress & Co), Ghost (looks cool, but a lot of features are missing), Drupal (really customizable, but cannot find working modules for some features), and Joomla (not sure how good free modules are, also concerned about security issues). Right now I am deciding b/w Drupal and Joomla. Which one is better for my use case? I'm on a tight budget and would rather code than pay for add-ons. Open to other CMS suggestions! Please help, I feel like I've been stuck with choosing the right CMS for too long.",

The support I got from the career advisor was worth the entire cost of the program. I’d look to see if that’s a path that would make sense for you.\n\nOne thing to know is that UI and UX are NOT the same, although they get lumped together offer by hiring managers who know nothing about either. UI is how something looks and functions while UX is how It flows for the users. You can have a beautiful website with shit UX, or a boring one with great UX. My favorite book on the subject is Steve Krug - don’t make me think revisited.\n\nNow back to you: you know how to code already and if you can connect your coding skills to your UX thinking, that’s a solid base. I’d kill to work with engineer you can think about the UX while building out designs, when issues pop up. Try working on some personal side projects, help friends who are trying to build something, go to online conferences and make connections. Those projects will help you expand you portfolio and help make that switch.

We pitched a ground-up rebuild to the client at a competitive rate, and showed him that the total cost of the rebuild would be less than the cost of maintaining the old platform for 11 months.

        "selftext": "I’ve decided to design a few sites these next coming months and I’m looking for advice on which platforms would be best to use in 2020. \n\nI graduated college in 2016 with experience in coding using Adobe Dreamweaver. I managed to code my own website from top to bottom including some bootstrap modifications, used a CSS (which I’m now learning about scss/sass), used codepen for things like my responsive navigation menu, and illustrator to create images for my portfolio. HOWEVER I am learning that with today’s technology I really should start learning how to use platforms such as WordPress seeing that businesses require you to know how to use it AND it makes coding so much quicker. \n\nSo over this last week, I started building a site in WP and found that you actually need to use their templates for the wireframe (which is 100% editable). However, I learned you need add-on’s to actually edit the content effectively. I have the free version of Elementor but in order to do anything substantial (including editing the appearance of my nav-bar) I need to buy the pro version. FYI I am already paying for the entire Adobe Creative Suite. Before I put money into Elementor, I want to know what are you all using in 2020 t build your sites? \n\nIdeally, this is what I’m looking for. \n• I want to freelance beautiful sites with varying degrees of pages/elements. \n• I don’t want to stress too much about updating my content with today’s constantly updated browsers. \n• I want to build sites at a decent manageable speed. \n• I want my sites to provide my clients with an edge and not just look like every other cookie cutter site. \n• I want my knowledge to transfer over to other jobs in the market (my husband is in the military which means we move a ton) and I’ve considered landing a job with an agency. \n\nI am open to any knowledge and advice you may have. I’m pretty new to the coding world.",

Although i would recommend a decent code editor, to maintain your sanity (unless you're feeling adventurous, then notepad will do just fine). I recommend visual studio code.\nNow the above will only make you a static site where you have to edit the html to add content. This is where a CMS (content management system) comes in. Most popular one is wordpress and you don't have to know how to code to build a site with wordpress. Just install a theme and you're good to go ( if just making a site is your goal )\nWordPress is where you'll manage your blog.",

It's been 2 months since I started learning web development.now i am at intermediate level.. things will go tough when you start working and applying the knowledge you learn. So be perfect kn basics and core concepts of html5 and css. Then start using some css frame works like bootstarp, materialize, material ui which will make your development speed. You just have to understand their classes and syntaxes. Then mimic their components like navabar,carousel,cards,grid-system which will improve your development speed... First you learn html5,css3 with basic understanding of how the things work and then move to css frame works.. i personally use bootstarp as my css framework which has a huge community support... Once you learn html and css you can play with frame works which i am doing. Never hesitate to fix the issue and don't giveup on the making things right.. try to solve issues which will make you feel very confident and keeps alway motivated.. try to search solutions on internet but never giveup... Thats my suggestion buddie. After learning this things you will know what to do next... All the best ☺️",

        "author": "shepbryan",
        "id": "hdu9k6",
        "selftext": "# Howdy r/web_design.\n\n[u/shepbryan](https://www.reddit.com/user/shepbryan) here, long-time Squarespace builder and digital creator.\n\n**This year I've seen lots of posts exploring the merits/limits of Squarespace 7.1.** \n\nToday I'm sharing a website overhaul case study that might be useful to some of you as you consider whether to make the swap. *As a quick aside, I've already built 5 or 6 sites on Squarespace 7.1  during the quarantine so I'm pretty familiar with the new platform's pros and cons. I've also built around 30 sites on Squarespace 7. Feel free to AMA in the comments if you have any questions of your own.*\n\n# First: a little bit of the big picture.\n\nI'm currently the Creative Director at TomiLlama.com, a digital-first self-help project my family launched in 2017. We are a top Google result for tons of keywords related to personal growth.\n\nWhen we first launched our brand and website on Squarespace, we didn't know what we were doing. Over time, we developed a strong understanding of the search intent behind new visits to our site.\n\nOnce we started to align our blogging strategy with that intent, our site took off. The last 18 months have been a rocketship of organic growth via search, and in 2020 we've already had 45,000+ unique visitors and about \\~950 new email signups in the last 30 days...\n\nWith this deeper knowledge of the intent behind our visits, (and knowing  that we're planning our first e-course launch for July) I figured it was  time to revamp our CSS-laden [TomiLlama.com](https://tomillama.com/) from Squarespace 7 (Rally template) and make some crucial improvements.\n\nWhile building the previous website in 2018, I only had a basic understanding of UI/UX principles and SEO/CRO best practices. Over time the site got a little better with tweaks here and there, but eventually, it had become a CSS Frankensite.\n\nI had to be painfully careful with my styling changes because I might randomly break something on a page without realizing for days or weeks.\n\nStill,  by matching our site's content to customer intent we were able to overcome a mediocre site layout and deliver clear value to visitors,  reaching email signup rates of 5-8% on our top blog posts.\n\n# My hypothesis for rebooting the site was that if we tackled the following objectives, we would see a lift in our website KPIs of time on page, pages per session, and email signups:\n\n1. *Create a more consistent blog layout with value-centric CTA's for our lead magnets*\n2. *Distill the sitemap to our key pages and simplify our nav menu options*\n3. *Improve our internal link structure to connect the dots for visitors (and search engine crawlers) on our related blog topics*\n\nAs  I got started planning the new site, the decision became one of building out a new version of the old site on Rally again, but scrubbing much of our clunky custom CSS, useless meta tags, weak image captions,  etc...\n\nOR\n\nTackling the reboot on a fresh Squarespace 7.1 template and simply leaning into the new aesthetic + builder functionality, troubleshooting along the way, and trusting in the process.\n\n# I ultimately decided Squarespace 7.1 was the way to go, and here is some of my reasoning.\n\n**With our 7.0 site,**  we couldn't incorporate our design system into the website aesthetic very easily... we basically had to choose between one or two colors at all times because by default you either have your background color or  you have an alternate color that is overlaid on whatever background  image you've uploaded. The 7.0 Squarespace builder isn't very versatile  for someone who wants to build a website with a variety of  customizations without getting into the use of CSS/Javascript.\n\n**With 7.1, you can get more granular control over your site design before you need to use CSS.**  More specifically – with the Color option added to the new Design page  layout, we were able to create section layouts with very specific design  customizations.\n\nFor example, we don't use our alternate color of dark purple on our default palette very frequently... or ever actually.\n\nSo  I took that specific Color option and fully customized it with a unique newsletter block layout, image block layouts, a different color background, etc.\n\nBasically with  7.1, you can make independent customizations for different elements in  each color palette. That's up to 10 on-call page design themes you can  potentially work with while building a site, or even a single page!  Sure, Squarespace defaults these palettes to automatically match the  colors you've selected... but you can absolutely break that mold and  repurpose the palette system for your own creative benefit. I used the  specific customized section I mentioned for our lead magnets so site  visitors who hit multiple pages get a consistent experience.\n\n# An interesting twist: I opted to manually build our blogs out as pages, instead of using the actual Blog page layout provided by Squarespace and a /blog URL slug:\n\nThis may seem like a strange thing to people unfamiliar with Squarespace, but working within the limitations that are baked into the Squarespace platform often becomes a constraint you need to creatively address. For example, blogging on Squarespace generally requires you to use a page type called... \"Blog\". However, the Blog page format is not very versatile in terms of page design.\n\nSo there are two reasons for me choosing to build my own blog page layout with breadcrumb navigation.\n\n**The first is that the new index page builder in Squarespace 7.1 is extremely powerful.**  It's highly customizable (see previous explanation of using various  color palette themes on the same page) and I feel empowered to make a  beautiful layout when I look at it. Drawing inspiration from Brian  Dean's site Backlinko, I made sure our blogs each had clear section  titles with anchor links as well as alternating color backgrounds in the  body text of our content.\n\nThe  hypothesis here is that the visual separation of information makes it  easier for readers to chunk and consume. It's extremely clear as you  scroll down one of our blogs that there is a finite number of sections  that are smartly labeled, and the general impression for new visitors is  that the info is well-organized and easy-to-access. This is something  that would be a massive pain in the ass to do on Squarespace's default  blog page layout. The caveat here is that now I need to set up Disqus  for each blog page if I want to regain the use of a comments section on  our blogs. Still troubleshooting this piece.\n\n**The  second is that in terms of page weight for SEO, Squarespace weighs home  pages at 1.0, standard pages at .75, and blog posts at .5.** By manually  creating my own blog page structure with breadcrumb navigation, our  best content will now be weighted more heavily in the eyes of search  engines (at .75 instead of .5). I'm not entirely sure about the science  behind this, but I couldn't find anything telling me NOT to do this and  as far as sitemaps go I could see that high-ranking sites like [backlinko.com](https://backlinko.com/) and [jamesclear.com](https://jamesclear.com/)  don't have /blog in their URL slugs either. I'm no supreme SEO god, so  don't take this as a divine mandate. Again, it's just personal  experience and good research leading me to this decision.\n\n# Overall, the new site is blowing the old one away on all of our KPIs.\n\nFor us the swap has been absolutely worth it, bugs included.\n\n**Breakdown of my goals, the post-launch results, and my checklist for getting there.**\n\n**Goal 1:** Improve our rate of email signups with better blog layouts & clear CTAs for our lead magnets\n\n**Goal 2:** Keep people on our site longer with more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user experience\n\n**Goal 3:** Simplify our design & content management system\n\n**Goal 4:** Make it visually clear that Tomi Llama is a world-class digital brand in the self-help industry\n\n**Results after launching:**\n\n* \\+75% increase in form submissions on [TomiLlama.com](https://tomillama.com/) from 307/week before to 537/week after.\n   * This  metric is measured in Squarespace's analytics and it's very useful from  a CRO perspective. It tells us what specific forms were submitted,  which page they are on, as well as the # of unique views, submissions,  and the conversion rate for each form. Some of our forms are now  converting at >18%! 😮\n* \\+37% increase in actual Mailchimp subscribers from 210/week to 288/week.\n   * The  big disparity between form submissions / new subscribers is due to Tomi  Llama superusers who sign up for multiple lead magnets during a site  visit. Our new site is more intuitive to explore, and we define each  lead magnet's value in a prominent location on-page.\n* \\+22% average session duration\n   * Most  of our essential pages now average over 1min per session. We  restructured the information on each blog post to follow a similar  system that lets readers go as deep as they want on a topic. Simpler  content at the top, deeper stuff towards the bottom.\n* \\+18% overall page view\n   * Users  are finding it easier to explore more of our site since our internal  linking structure dramatically improved with our blog revamps\n\n**My checklist for reaching this goal:**\n\n* Review  our highest converting forms to see what insights I could gain about  alignment between the content and the perceived value of a lead magnet\n* Review  actual anonymous user visits to the site using Lucky Orange, an  analytics tool. I was able to see heatmaps of user interactions on our  pages to learn what was being clicked and what was being ignored, how  far down a page the average user was scrolling, as well as understand  how new users were exploring the site. From there, I tried to condense  all the best parts into the higher visibility parts of the blog.  Basically, if only 25% of people were actually scrolling down to  discover the lead magnet, we were functionally losing 75% of visitors  who didn't even know there was more value for them to receive. We now  have lead magnet forms in the first 10% of the scroll on all posts.\n* Study  some of the best SEO-oriented websites on the internet to understand  how they structure their content to look good and also hit their on-page  SEO keywords. I heavily dug into Brian Dean's site, Backlinko.com, for  inspiration. You'll notice our blog layout is adapted from Brian's  fantastic definitive guides, down to the alternating background  sections.\n* Map  our entire site's SEO plan using Airtable. This way I could see that we  were hitting all the appropriate keywords for H1/H2 and body text.\n* Use  Ahrefs to scour the top pieces of content for our best keywords and  effectively incorporate the best of the best into our own materials.  This tool also gives you an idea of how easy it can be to create a  definitive piece of content that's better than what else is out there.  Without Ahrefs, I would still have this looming sense that I'm missing  something or that someone else is going to outpace us with better  content. Ahrefs Content Explorer let me easily review hundreds of blog  posts across our niche, and ultimately I came away feeling really good  about the quality of our own content.\n* Use  Ahrefs again to audit our site once it was live to find any broken  links I may have missed. I ended up finding 4 broken links, 4 incorrect  redirects, and a handful of anchor links that needed a little update.  This was the final house-keeping piece of the site launch for me.\n\n**My findings from the research and review stage:**\n\nThe  old site ultimately wasn't very intuitive to navigate – our nav menu  included slugs like \"Llama Store\" and \"Meet Tomi\" that were unfamiliar  and thus not compelling to new visitors. Additionally, there were so  many different things in the overall UI of the site and our blog posts  that NO ONE was clicking. I'm talking ZERO people clicking a button,  link, image, product, etc., out of thousands of visits. So I decided we  would streamline and build out the new site around what was working the  best for us – our top six blogs / lead magnets.\n\nRather  than peppering forms throughout our blogs willy-nilly and hoping  someone might sign up, we restructured our blogs to follow a 3-step  informative process that is logical for someone who is first exploring a  topic and also useful for someone who is returning to explore again. We  added anchor links and clear section titles to all content. And we  added a lead magnet signup at the top of each blog, and again around the  30-50% mark of a blog.\n\nWith this  new structure, each section has a clear explanation of the value to the  reader that also ties back to our lead magnets.\n\nThe  results have blown me away. Before our new site was live, we saw  between 250-300 form submissions per week as measured via Squarespace's  Form Analytics. At the end of the rainbow, this was resulting in roughly  180-200 new subscribers being added to our Mailchimp list weekly. The  true tally of new subscribers has never aligned with our actual forms  submitted tally on Squarespace, due to users signing up for multiple  lead magnets during one visit. I won't say there's any sort of maxim you  can extrapolate from this for your own venture – it's just what I've  learned to expect from the Tomi Llama audience.\n\nWith  the new site live, our first week of submissions totaled 537 form subs  on Squarespace and 288 new subscribers in Mailchimp. Compared to the  week before our site launch which had 307 form subs on Squarespace and  about 210 new subs in Mailchimp. Some quick maths here to get the  increase in conversion rates:\n\n**Our increase in on-site form submissions is \\~75% (537/307=1.749)**\n\n**Our increase in new subscribers is \\~37% (288/210=1.371)**\n\nThis  wasn't a fluke by any means. We planned out our digital overhaul and  executed it with zero hiccups. Even flipping our old site over to our  new site had less than 1 hour of downtime, meaning we lost minimal  subscribers during that down hour on our site. Once the site was fully  live, I made sure to submit the new sitemap to Google Search Console and  do a site audit with Ahrefs.\n\n# Here's what I attribute these improvements to:\n\n* **Significantly better UI/UX**\n* **A deeper understanding of our customer journey.**  The goal for us at this point is to give people amazing free content,  offer them a supplementary resource that improves their experience with  the free content in some way, and add them to our email list. We're  launching a premium e-course next quarter that is built specifically for  our 5k+ subscribers.\n* **High level of clarity for site visitors as to what the value we are offering them is**… breaking it down with smart copy and clear value propositions with our lead magnets\n* **Better creative.**  I've been working with an illustrator/watercolorist in Atlanta for the  past few years to create Tomi's signature Studio Ghibli-esque aesthetic.  On this project, everything finally came together. I had lots of great  resources like hi-res watercolor paintings, vector graphics of our llama  characters, and many digital mockups of our physical goods like books,  values cards, and worksheets.\n* **And yes, building on Squarespace 7.1**!  I love the new Squarespace builder. I've already built 5-6 sites using  it and it makes it much easier to maintain a consistent brand aesthetic  across many different web pages. I used the new Color palette feature to  create a series of customized page layouts that my other team members  can easily replicate as our site continues to grow and expand with new  content. I think ultimately 7.1 represents a leap forward in terms of  using Squarespace to underpin the design systems of a business. 7.1  makes establishing that system a much easier process than before. Just  be sure you take notes while you design so other's can replicate the  work.\n\n# Bugs I observed during the project:\n\n* For some reason our billing is buggy and won't update to recognize a new credit card. I've contacted support.\n* During  the site swap, the first time I submitted the sitemap to Google I got  an error. I assume this was because there was a hiccup in our */sitemap.xml* link from Squarespace as the site got flipped over. I waited 6 hours and resubmitted successfully.\n* For  some reason about 0.5% of form submissions return a \"form submission  error\" even though we've double-checked all our form connections to  Mailchimp/Zapier. I usually add these folks manually and send them their  lead magnet personally.\n* The  analytics page isn't showing Mailchimp referrals very effectively... if  100 people click a link via email and arrive on the site, the unique  Mailchimp click ID only registers a couple of visitors in the referral  section of our analytics.\n\nHopefully this breakdown of our site revamp is helpful to you as you consider whether to make something on Squarespace 7.1.\n\nAsk me questions in the comments and I'll do my best to reply!",
