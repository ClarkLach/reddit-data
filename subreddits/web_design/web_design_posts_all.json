The site will host encouraging scriptures and advice, but will ask nothing of  visitors in any way. In fact, it will offer viewers no possible way to enter data or even contact anyone. It will be stand-alone for information only.  Other than a bare-bones visitor count, I will not design the site to intentionally harvest any other information from visitors.\n\nWhat I want to know is, is the site is not harvesting data, and ask for no data or provides anyone for the users to even input any data, does the privacy laws still require have things like a Cookie Consent and a Privacy Disclaimer?\n\nI obviously want to obey the law, I just think that having disclaimer popups about Cookies and Tracking will be give the wrong impression about the site's purpose. I mean, the purpose is to offer no-strings, hands-off, anonymous, encouragement and hope to people. Having a popup saying \"**We might be tracking you!\"** seems to counter the message the site is intended to send and is misleading, since that is not what I will design the site to do.  I understand that there may be some tracking done by the hosting company and by google, but that is not something the site will be doing or have any control over. \n\nCan it be done?",

Google isn’t great when it comes to protecting privacy, but also GDPR is so broad that capturing a user’s IP Address (even for the purpose of serving a font) is considered storing Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\n\nAlso, I’m sure there are plenty of other services out there that are following a similar playbook to Google, but I just mention those because they’re so widely used across websites without a 2nd thought.

It also requires cookie consent if cookies are used for tracking or analytics (like Google Analytics).\n2. **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: If your site gets visitors from California, CCPA may apply, and it may require a privacy policy and a cookie notice if you're collecting any data.\n\nSince your site might still use Google Analytics or other tools that set cookies, it's a good idea to include a basic privacy policy explaining what data (if any) is collected and how it's used, even if it's minimal. You could also consider offering a discreet cookie notice, maybe without a pop-up, as an alternative, ensuring the user experience aligns with your site's message of privacy and simplicity.\n\nWhile it's understandable to not want pop-ups, the key is transparency.

But the data you collect cannot identify a specific person without extreme dedication.\n\nSo town/state/country are a definite no. You could pretty easily identify a user from their town, depending on the content of the site (i.e. if it's niche, there's less people in town who'd be your \"target\"). State and country *should* be fine but when you consider countries like San Marino being smaller in population than some towns... yeah, it's best to leave them off. Finding 1 person in a group of 33,000 isn't \"impossible\".\n\nUser IDs/email address/etc. are obvious nos. But a session ID *could* be ok if the ID is completely random and there is no storage of it anywhere; i.e. you were using it to be able to track user journeys... BUT then you get into the question of would it be identifiable? So again, probably safer to leave it out.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think there's a hard and fast rule on what is \"personally identifiable\", outside of the obvious things (user ID, email address, phone number, name, etc.) so I would generally just say that if could I look at the analytics and say which data is **likely** mine (it may not be, but based on the data it could be), then it is personally identifiable. Though, I wouldn't be surprised if there's companies which run analytics, are GDPR compliant, and use a metric like you could identify 500 or more people, but nothing more refined, in the world based on what you gather.",

That it seems counterintuitive since the whole point is that we Don't Handle or store any user data.\n\nI really think everyone is not clearly understand what I am saying here.  Everyone keeps referring to things like Google Analytics and storing user data when I have expressly said that the website will do none of that, and if any data is collected or stored, it is not the owner of the website doing it. I think what people are struggling with is the idea that, We Don't Want any user data at all. If other services' collet it, that is outside of our Intention, Desire, and Control.\n\nI mean, let's be realistic here. If you are on the internet, you are being tracked.  This message, I am writing here, will pass through many nodes, and each one of those nodes will collect data on this message.  Each one of those nodes does not have to give you a notice to Accept this before it passes your message through. Does every website owner have to be responsible for all the information collected about a user by all the nodes and severs that processes their calls and requests before they even reach their website?  That is ridiculous! That is to make the website owner responsible for what OTHER people, they have no control over, are doing.\n\nI feel like I am not being understood here and everyone thinks that I am secretly trying to figure out how to collect user data without disclosing it.  That is the exact opposite.  I don't freaking want darn single bit of user data and will do everything in my power to design the website to not collect it any. If any gets collected, it will not be me doing it and will be completely without my permission or control. Why am I responsible for that?",

The law had good intention, but all it really did was make everyone deal with an annoying pop-up each time they go to a new site.\n\nChatbots are also annoying IMO, but I usually only see them in contexts where they're relevant. Eg. When I'm looking through subscription options from some ISP, or other contexts where I might actually want to talk to a representative for a minute.\n\nExtensions: I'm not sure what you mean by this.

Of course I take care about colors, I use REM instead of PX, I often but not always use clamp functions, I leave enough spaces, I also test keyboard navigation, I use page builders and forms that take care about aria labels or allow at least to control it, I label the fields on forms even though a placeholder only is often more aestetic. I take care about file names but not to the very last details, and at least I auto generate the alt text from the file name for images.

It's just something you do.\n\nThe act has been a thing since 2019, accessibility has been a topic since the begining of the internet. The guidelines, acts and all are trying to talk about everything for every case, in majority of cases making websites you'll follow the same guidelines over and over again. With most stuff being handled automatically if your code is good.

But with every additional layer of competency and regulation I am getting farther away from those three.

First, good on you for having the sense to ask before doing.\n\nYou do not want to track any user behavior without tracking / cookie consent, otherwise you will be liable in countries protected by gdpr law. The only way to get around this is to not provide service in EU countries.\n\nJust add a standard TOS contract & a tracking consent banner. They're everywhere nowadays.\n\nAlso, be wary of forwarding personally identifiable info to any analytics vendors you use (such as amplitude). Everything needs to be anonymized. If you use email as a unique users identifier, then you'll want to encrypt before sending. Many dev sdks for sending data do not do this for you, and may also auto-collect other info such as IP. Even browser settings can fall under this category (ex, browser / device fingerprinting).\n\nBy venturing into behavioral tracking territory, you are now considered a \"data controller\" under gdpr. If you do not anonymize data sent to 3rd parties, then you need to provide mechanisms allowing your users to perma-delete their data from said 3rd parties.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: By the way, my recommendation if you think you will lean into behavioral tracking, is to send data through segment.io. At my work, we built our own multi-destination pipeline, but segment is a great product for smaller apps.",

The localStorage is a boolean stored on the USER side. No user data is stored or acquired on the server to achieve the unique count that wouldn't already be present with any other HTTP request. If you visit a site from Google search results, the HTTP request for your first page view before agreeing to any policy is exactly the same as the ajax HTTP request that would be ran under the hood for incrementing the unique tally. It's perfectly legal to count page views and unique visits without user consent if you're utilizing either of the two methods (localStorage or 304 Not Modified) described in my previous post. As mentioned earlier, any argument otherwise is the equivalent to saying a restaurant owner can't count the number of people who walk into their restaurant every day without the express consent of each customer.\n\nOnce you start using persistent session IDs and/or logging IP addresses to count unique page views, then there's an argument to be had. But the two methods I've described are not in a gray area and do not require user consent since neither method gives you ANY means to actually track or identify the user in subsequent HTTP requests - there's no ID or hash to identify them in any way (even anonymously). There's no data link of any kind. No names, no IP addresses, no hashes, no codes - zip zero nada.\n\nFrankly the fact this is even an issue shows how absurd the laws are and how absurd people's interpretations of said laws are.  Look at your web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS - whatever) - even if you're not counting anything on your website or using any cookies of any kind, chances are your server is logging all kinds of crap (IP addresses, user agents, referrers, etc.) behind the scenes and chances are your firewall is logging all kinds of crap behind the scenes. I bet 2/3 of the people here saying you need user consent to count unique views have all of the aforementioned logs running behind the scenes on the server or firewall level without nary a thought about disabling them. Furthermore, people running smaller web applications via shared hosting providers wouldn't even have the means to disable such logs.

It's about requiring user consent regarding the collection of user data (including anonymous data) that is not \"strictly necessary.\" So you're absolutely right about the scope of it. But this method does not collect ANY data, identifiable or anonymous. I've read through numerous FAQs and EU documents on the topic and have found absolutely nothing that distinguishes the method I've just described from any other regular page view that would exist and be recorded prior to someone accepting or rejecting a cookie or privacy policy. The method I've described equates to a page view - nothing more. It involves nothing more than an HTTP request. It requires no identifying HTTP headers, nor does it anonymize data (meaning it does NOT take identifiable data and convert it to anonymous data). It's literally just a page view. All that is different is it is only viewed once. You aren't storing ANY user data whatsoever. You're incrementing a single number. It's perfectly legal to count page views and measure server load. How is this any different? That's like saying a restaurant owner isn't allowed to count the number of people walking through their door every day without the express consent of each patron.\n\nAnother way to count unique views without a notice is via asset caching. For example, if you send a cache header for a regular asset (like a CSS stylesheet that is present on every page) that expires in X days, there's nothing stopping you from incrementing your unique views everytime you send an HTTP response for that asset that doesn't include a \"304 Not Modified\" header.",

A UUID is stored in local storage and unconditionally sent to an endpoint via AJAX.\n2. That UUID is transformed via a cryptographically strong one-way anonymous hash.\n3. That anonymous hash is stored in a set in the database. No other information is stored about that request (the IP address isn't stored, the original UUID is wiped from memory, etc).\n\nThe number of unique users is the size of that set. The set is useless by itself except as a way to count unique users, it's functionally equivalent to just incrementing an integer like in your example despite being needlessly complicated.\n\nIn this alternate scenario, it seems clearer that anonymized user information is being stored.\n\nNow these two situations are different. It's not obvious that they'd be equivalent in the eyes of whoever would end up deciding whether each scenario is compliant or not.\n\nBut they seem awfully similar to me.",

This does not need to be front and center on your site, but if you’re going to track your users you are legally required (in some jurisdictions like California and Europe) to tell them and give them an opt out mechanism. Rather than have different messages for different regions, it’s better to just have it somewhere on the site, which is why so many implement it as a modal.\n\nThats why you see so many sites with that the “this site uses cookies” modal, and which has a “more info” link that shows the privacy policy (which no one will ever read).\n\nI like mixpanel because its sdk makes it easy to update the users preference and tie it to a button/click. Not sure if amplitude makes that easy.\n\nTLDR; you don’t need to be a privacy expert; just copy what a reputable site has done and use a canned privacy policy.",

There's no precedent to tell us whether it is or not, yet.\n\nIt all depends on the scope of your A/B testing.\n\nIf your A/B testing is as simple as \"how many sales do we have on version 1, 2, and 3 respectively?\" then it is not processing personal data at all. There is literally no identifiable information of any kind being stored or processed.\n\nThe second it turns identifiable, then you're in opt-in territory.   \nFact of the matter is though a lot of A/B testing can be done entirely anonymously. A/B systems just aren't typically designed for being anonymous because the business doesn't give a shit.\n\nRegistering mouse coordinate data for instance, isn't inherently under the purview of the GDPR, it's only when you tie it to an identifier like a cookie or user ID that it is. Pretty much all A/B testing systems do that though, so it becomes a GDPR matter. \n\nSo the real question is, what kind of A/B testing is being done, what kind of data is being stored, and can it all be entirely anonymous... If it can be, then you're golden.\n\nPs. I feel like enticing opt-in is a fantastic way to get regulatory bodies on your ass. I wouldn't touch that with a ten-foot pole. \n\nPPs. We all need to ask ourselves as the ones creating these services if we're actually fighting tooth and nail for something that's actually beneficial, or if we're just used to a certain way of doing things and have an idea what we're doing is \"good for business\".",

The A/B testing we conduct is entirely centered on page layout, and no personal data is collected - we can't even drill down into individual session data.\n\nHowever, [the ICO only gives three examples of cookies exempt from opt-in](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/#exemptions):\n\n>...you are unlikely to need consent for:  \n>  \n>• cookies used to remember the goods a user wishes to buy when they add goods to their online basket or proceed to the checkout on an internet shopping website;  \n>  \n>• session cookies providing security that is essential to comply with data protection security requirements for an online service the user has requested – eg online banking services; or  \n>  \n>• load-balancing cookies that ensure the content of your page loads quickly and effectively by distributing the workload across several computers.\n\nThe new Head of IT is incredibly risk-averse, and so interprets this as meaning that all A/B testing requires consent. \n\nThe only writing I can find about whether or not A/B testing is allowed without consent or as opt-out post-2018 comes from either cookie solution software providers (which have a strong incentive to say that we need to pay for their software in order to A/B test) and [this page,](https://www.convert.com/blog/privacy/analytics-and-a-b-testing-cookies-only-after-consent-in-europe/) which can only provide a solid statement on the issue from the French authorities. I need something to present to him as a credible source that makes the case that our A/B testing can continue without opt-in consent.",

Still, trusting the client to do anything but the most trivial checks is not secure.\n\nLike, hiding a menu option on the front end that links to a secured route if your JWT user claim doesn't include a specific role, probably fine... But you should still have the server verify creds if user accesses the route.\n\nYou can do all of this with cookies & JWT... Just be aware you need to verify everything the client gives you.

So instead of using SVG, a new better language, why not just mal-appropriate the CSS you're already comfortable with? It just shows lazy / bad thinking.\n\nYou can make graphics in Microsoft Excel, where every cell is a color.

That’s why I built [**Bookmarkify**](https://bookmarkify.io/) — a browser extension to help you save, organize, and explore design inspiration *without* the chaos.\n\n# Here's what it does:\n\n* **Grid & device view modes** – preview saved sites in desktop, tablet, or mobile sizes\n* **Tags** – organize and filter your saved sites easily\n* **Design Analyze** – grab fonts and colors from any site instantly\n* **Dark mode** – obviously.\n* **Daily Inspiration** – 6 new curated sites delivered every day\n* **Saving images/videos** – Even save videos and images as part of your inspiration\n\nNo more screenshots. No more endless tab hopping. Just a clean, focused space for your web design inspo.\n\nWould love to hear what you think / or what features you'd want added",

So the site is still easy to use on ridiculously wide monitors? \n\n\\- The leading property management companies logos are all too small. \n\n\\- I think you should consider placing the company logos or the testimonials further to the top, so the user won't have to scroll too far down to see them.

The actual European legal text is:\n\n> the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information\n\nSo it is the *storing and accessing* of information that triggers consent requirements, not the use of cookies in particular. Other rules around the globe, such as those in California, employ similarly broad language.\n\n(A minor side note, but cookie law is called EPD, not GDPR as many seem to believe. Gdpr is a separate somewhat related regulation that came later).\n\nThe more nuanced answer is that it depends what the pixel actually does. If it merely counts page views numerically, my understanding is that does not trigger any consent requirements. It is technically possible to create analytics that sufficiently avoid collecting user information as to not require consent, but almost no one does this, so in practice effectively all tracking pixels trigger consent requirements.\n\nFurther reading: https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2023/11/20/edpb-publishes-guidelines-to-clarify-scope-of-eu-cookie-notice-and-consent-requirements/",

I then hide the input field with CSS (display:none). \nIf this is set, I will also just show success and not store the data.\n\nWhile this likely cuts down on some of the spam, it is not nearly enough.\nNow that I think of it, I do not count how many requests I discard based on this honeyput - I probably should gather stats on that..\n\n\nYour cookie idea is interesting!\n\nWould you mind elaborating a bit on how you actually do this?\n\n1: Do you set the cookie on the page that contains the form?\n\n2: Cookie set server-side or with javascript?\n (my sites are completely static, so I cannot set server side cookies easily, however, I might be able to put something in apache that sets a cookie on a specific path)\n\n3: So do you just measure the timestamp on the server with what is in the cookie. And if it is, say, less than a second, you discard the request?\n\n4: What is a reasonable time difference needed for you not to discard?\n\n\n\nI have actually played a bit with a similar idea. What I do is I put a form element \n\n    <input type=\"hidden\" id=\"timestamp\" name=\"timestamp\">\n\nI then have some javascript set the timestamp value to current time.\n\nI then check on the server side on the server that processes the requests what the time difference is between the timestamps. My idea was that if the time difference was less than 1-2 seconds, then a human could not have filled the form. And if the time difference was too great (more than 24h) then it would probably be some bot that just uses  are stored set of values. Also, if the value was not set I would discard it.\n\nI have not ended up using this, however, because I lost actual real requests from at least one customer who uses NoScript extension.\nAnd also, I use a different server to process requests than the one serving the static sites.

This  year we're expecting around 250 cars and maybe 2000 people. Every car is given a number, and historically we've hand counted paper ballots, but the last couple years have seen the numbers of cars and voters skyrocket. Hand counting last year was brutal. \n\nOn my site I have a page with all the categories listed, the user clicks on whatever category they want, and places their vote on whatever software is embedded in the page. I'd really like to avoid making people sign in to anything.   \n  \nI was planning on using CrowdSignal, but in testing I found one of my friends is able to vote as many times as they'd like, even though the check box is ticked for once per computer. It locks out everyone else but her. For whatever reason her Iphone with safari sneaks past their cookie based system.\n\nI'm worried about hitting the limit for a free account on Survey Monkey, and I don't want to pay for a full year for a single event.\n\nSogolytics  looks great but they don't allow surveys to be one response only.  With a poll you can only do multiple choice, and it only allows 150 choice inputs. \n\nGoogle Forms requires a google log in to limit to one response. But I do really like that you can go back in and change your response. \n\nAnyone got any other suggestions to look at? \n\nThanks in advance. ",

If the image is not a perfect square in your case then the longer side of the rectangle will have to expand beyond 100% to compensate. \n\nAssuming you want this effect of the image filling up the entire 200x200px area it would be best to crop your images square before uploading. Otherwise if it's a rectangle then one side will always need to expand beyond 100% width of the container and the image will be cut off like you're seeing. \n\nI can't tell you why it looks fine in the editor without seeing the code, but my guess is something outside of the editor is constraining the images to 200px (other plugin, external css, js, etc) and the editor doesn't have that same constraint, eyeballing it the images in your editor look wider than the live site.",

It's a very simple site, and I'm wicked smart, so I'm going to figure it out. A little bit of advice from some more experienced programmers will help a lot.\n\nThe modern standard is to use drag and drop templates to build simple websites. These templates do a lot of the responsiveness work for you. But the downside is that there is no attention to detail. So everything looks OK, but nothing looks really good. I'm building a sleek, tight website with all of the layout details thought through on every commonly used device at every commonly used setting. It's going to blow my competitors out of the water.\n\nIt is a very simple site. It's almost completely static. The only nearly dynamic parts are drop down product descriptions and a contact form that sends me an email. No cookies, no logins, no cart, no checkout. It's an old school landing page with a navigation bar in the header and several pages for products, services, and information.\n\nI started off in WordPress, but I've been making much faster progress since I abandoned it and started using html, CSS and JavaScript with no template.\n\nI've got the site layout built and all of the content loaded. I've got it formatted so it looks good on my desktop. The next step is to make it look good on all commonly used devices at all commonly used settings. For that I'm going to use emulators to show me how the website renders on various devices at various settings.\n\nWhat I want to know is, which emulator(s) should I use? Which specific categories of devices and settings do I need to worry about? What are the clever little tricks that are going to save me hours of tedium and squinting?\n\nI am using Windows 10 on a PC.",

The Variables get changed by a Media Query with prefers-color-scheme. If the user selects a certain Theme / toggles it, then you save that in the Cookie and read it on side load. When the Cookie is e.g. \"Dark\" then you add the class  \"dark\" to your body and use that to style your site. Because multiple classes are more dominant than a media queries you probably don't even need to do an extra parameter for your media query that toggles it off.\n\nStoring the Data of the prefered Theme in a Cookie is a good idea. You   \nDONT need seperate CSS files depending on the Theme (unless you want to   \nchange more than the main colors). Hope that helps!",

Which suggests that there might be something more complicated happening in your Varnish layer, as someone's obviously done some configuration.\n\nBest approach would be to understand what Varnish is doing for you, consider why it's been set up the way it has, and then either: (a) learn how to make it work properly; (b) turn it off with confidence.",

But then I get an annoying popup in the middle of the screen suggesting I go to the localised version of this site instead of the international version. If I click yes to get what you would (presume) is better more localised information, you would think it would take me to the localised version of that product page.

I cannot grasp why anyone would think this is a good idea. And to top it off, websites sometimes take your \"yes\" as a licence to redirect you to the localised version in future making it hard to go back to where you were. Now I have to delete cookies.\n\nSimilarly is the tendency now to redirect people to the home page if anything goes wrong on an online shop. Big local Australian hardware chain comes to mind. I try to go to the product page of something I needed and found a few days ago, but now it redirects me to the homepage. No explanation, it just does it.

I am looking to gather some information and possibly quotes for someone to develop a website and a logo for me. I do not have a coding/website development background and don't describe myself as creative/artistic so hence why I want to dip my toes in the water to get a rough idea on what this might cost me. Here is what I am looking for:\n\n1. Someone to give advice on domain acquisition and hosting. I have a domain name in mind and it is available.\n2. Someone to create a unique website from scratch. This website will not sell products, it will merely provide an overview of myself, the company, the services we offer, a contact page, etc. I would also like the ability to get to a log in page with some password protected pages for myself or clients. I would also like to use a private part of the site for non-business matters like storing personal pictures or other files. I am envisioning maybe 5 main public pages on the website. I do not have the text written up yet for the pages and I would like the ability to change the text years down the road on my own.\n3. Someone to create a logo that I own the explicate rights to that can be used on the website, business cards, etc.\n4. Someone who can educate me, quantify improvements, and implement actions for Search Engine Optimization.\n\nWith that in mind what questions should I be asking to ensure I am getting apples to apples quotes from people who can provide these services? I know that there are some basic website development tool palates and I am inclined to think that might result in a cookie cutter looking website which I want to avoid. Is this gut feeling valid or not?\n\nThanks!",

You’ll get slapped with a template and a bunch of plugins - not a developer, not custom work. \n\nAvoid anyone charging cheap prices - the same reasons good developers avoid cheap clients. The end result and relationship is usually dog shit. \n\nQuestions - ask to see work examples if you can’t already. Don’t accept \"can’t be done\" as an answer when everything relating to custom work can. \n\nIs it nice to look at? How is the experience. How would they handle the technical ask where you want to store pictures. \n\nThere is a lot of pretenders out there and also \"agencies\" that are really someone, or more that have watched a few videos and slapped together some awful looking template on a web builder. Now they are an \"agency\" - avoid.\n\nDevelopers doing custom work charge a high price tag because it’s a high standard of work and custom should always be a high standard of work. \n\nGood luck.",

Databases - you can run one on your computer, add data to it with SQL, define the schema of the data. Query it with command line commands, get lists of data back from it. Think of it like a command line program on your computer. There's no user interface other than the command line, it's just on your computer. \n\nA web app, it's a running application that can take people's web requests and serve them responses that they can see in their browser or other web-requesting thing, over a private network or the internet, if they're connected.\n\nNow, most web apps need data, so there are ways of making your web app go and look up data in a database when it needs it, but the problem you have is you've merged the two concepts and now want a \"database web application\" that you can install.

However, with more knowledge I could also be better able to direct another if I commission this as a paid for project. I have absolutely no requirement for the site to look good. It simple has to fill the following functions.\n\n* Have a page listings all parts in the database as text (with images provided on hovering the part names) with a text box next to each.\n* Users would put in the number of pieces they have from 0 to 9,999.  \n\n* At the top and bottom of the page would be a save button, that would output to a downloadable text file. Allowing people to save their entrys as text. If its possible to save to cookies that would work too. \n\n[The data output would not include entries for items in which the user stated quantity of 0. There will be an advanced code option to enter and * which will be taken to mean the user does not have the part but wants to system to perform all searches as though the user has 9,999 and any sets listed as a result of the * entry will be highlighted: if all entries are * then the output should be every set highlighted].\n\n* On the 'next' page would be a space to upload the contents of the text file by cut and paste. And a series of questions via tickboxes.\n\n[It should be possible to return to the parts list page after entering the txt file data should one need to make changes].\n* Once the questions are answered the database would output a series of lists.\n\n* The key feature is that the database would be able to output:\n\n1. Sets you can make with your collection.\n2. Sets you can make if you use parts from your collection which do not match the colours in the instructions.\n3. Sets you could make from commercially available parts which were/are not common in retail sets. - The parts in this list will be subjective and set by the admin - by tagging in the database so as to make it easier to update the list.\n\n4. Output would be saved if the user leaves the page and then returns with back or other means.\n\n5. The ability to **invert** the output so it shows only the sets it would usually hide - in each category.\n\n* The database for sets will be searchable by the set codes but the pages for each set would only contain the parts lists for the set and cover art. A PDF of instructions will only be provided for instructions not digitised by the manufacture.\n\n\nAh, a final requirement. There are over 2,000 sets and over 200 parts and over 100 colours. The final output would need to be able to distinguish parts [by shape] from [parts by] colours if asked to. I imagine the best way to do this would be a unique database-only name (or representative hex number) for each part which includes the colour and shape. But I imagine it could be also done by the equivalent of tagging multiple tags to each entry (such as part 1, shape 1, colour 1,).",

I now know that's not the case, and lo-and-behold if I delete cookies for that site, it also defaults to Chinese.\n\nI repeated this test in Firefox. Initially, minecraft.net loads the `en-us ` version. If I change the language to `zh-hans` it will persist, even if I clear cookies.\n\nHow is this information being stored? Is there a third-party involved that both of these sites query, or a unique browser ID or something? Is it possible to convince both these sites that I'm not Chinese?\n\n**Solved! When I first visited the minecraft site in Chinese, I used Chrome's built-in translation feature, and somehow Chinese got added to Chrome's language settings, resulting in Chinese being added to my `HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` http header field.**",

I managed to code my own website from top to bottom including some bootstrap modifications, used a CSS (which I’m now learning about scss/sass), used codepen for things like my responsive navigation menu, and illustrator to create images for my portfolio. HOWEVER I am learning that with today’s technology I really should start learning how to use platforms such as WordPress seeing that businesses require you to know how to use it AND it makes coding so much quicker. \n\nSo over this last week, I started building a site in WP and found that you actually need to use their templates for the wireframe (which is 100% editable). However, I learned you need add-on’s to actually edit the content effectively. I have the free version of Elementor but in order to do anything substantial (including editing the appearance of my nav-bar) I need to buy the pro version. FYI I am already paying for the entire Adobe Creative Suite. Before I put money into Elementor, I want to know what are you all using in 2020 t build your sites? \n\nIdeally, this is what I’m looking for. \n• I want to freelance beautiful sites with varying degrees of pages/elements. \n• I don’t want to stress too much about updating my content with today’s constantly updated browsers. \n• I want to build sites at a decent manageable speed. \n• I want my sites to provide my clients with an edge and not just look like every other cookie cutter site. \n• I want my knowledge to transfer over to other jobs in the market (my husband is in the military which means we move a ton) and I’ve considered landing a job with an agency. \n\nI am open to any knowledge and advice you may have.

It can be set up to work like any database, clients are mostly familiar with the interface and you can limit the exact scope of what you want them to be able to edit. [https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/php](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/php) that's the official docs, but there's also some PHP wrappers & tutorials etc that you can surely find if you search around for a bit",

        "selftext": "I am currently working forward to setup a new website, and I don't know how to make an attractive, simple and elegant interface that really stands out without it being too crowded confusing or cluttered with a lot of information so that when a new users comes to the website he is confused and or feel bombarded with the staggering amount of information, but still I want it to be rich. (by the way please o please tell me about such interfaces or any samples of such interfaces cause I really don't know what to do and I am literally stuck so you would be helping me a billion  even if you could give me a sample interface or something)\n\nanyways I am stuck with this and am looking at some websites, then it hit me that almost all websites like 99% of what I see are 'classic' in a sense like they are only working with 2d and with the pixels available on the screen without consideration for depth. \n\nThen this idea sparked have there been or are there any websites that you can interact with in VR or 3d mode? I tried to search online for such website interfaces and I could not find any. Would 3d interfaces be worse at confusing the user?\n\nThank you previously for your help",

                "body": "IMO using 3D is quite risky simply because users are used to certain paradigms in interfaces. You scroll vertically to see more content, links either open new pages / popups or scroll somewhere else, etc. Anything out of the ordinary needs to be extra thought out to feel natural and not confusing. One way to achieve that is by building on top of existing experiences the user might have.\n\nA fantastic example [is this site](https://bruno-simon.com/), where you drive an RC car around the pages \"landscape\". It works because almost everyone has played a game where you steer a car, so you already know the controls, and also it's just plain fun.\n\nVR, on the other hand, is tricky. You need to port the experience to a 2D screen in the end, which comes with all the problems VR is trying to solve - navigating, manipulating content etc.\n\nSo if I were you, I would pick from these options -\n\n* The \"toy car game\" approach, where it's a fun, familiar experience\n* Keep using \"normal\" interfaces, but use 3D for backgrounds and flourishes that responds to scroll / mouse movements, like [here for example](https://go.pioneer.com/cornrevolution) or [here](https://www.orano.group/experience/innovation/en/protect).\n\nOf course, it depends on what the website is actually about. If it's for yourself personally to experiment with, it would probably be fun to try to do something unorthodox with [threejs](https://threejs.org/) or push 3D CSS to its limits.",

        "selftext": "EDIT: added extra tips from other users. \n\nI see this question pop up a lot so I wanted to share with everyone how I optimize all my sites now to get a 100 page speed score and 100’s across the board in lighthouse. \n\nFor verification of my efforts, here’s a site I’m working on that scores 100\n\nhttps://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fariseconstructions2.netlify.app%2F\n\nOPTIMIZING ASSETS\n\nThis is the most impactful thing you can do. \n\nDONT LOAD A 5000px WIDE IMAGE WHEN ITS BEING DISPLAYED AT 400px. One of the BIGGEST mistakes I see in other sites is large images that don’t need to be so big. If the image is displayed in your site at 600px wide, resize it to 600px (or for better clarity on retina displays, set it to 2X display size) instead of 5000px or whatever you have. Same thing goes for mobile image. Use the picture element to serve up different sizes images for different screen sizes. Here’s the code \n\n<picture>\n  <source srcset=\"landing.jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 600px)\">\n  <img src=\"landing-m.jpg\" alt=\"landing image\" height=“600” width=“600” loading=“lazy” decoding=“async”>\n</picture>\n\nYou put the mobile sized image in the img tag and the normal sized one in the source tag. When the media query is false, it gets skipped and the default img tag source is displayed instead. So in this case if the screen size is less than 600px, load the mobile sized image. If it is at least 600px then load the normal sized image. \n\nI make my mobile images the size they’re at on the largest mobile screen. Usually I set the screen size to 400px and whatever the size the image is on that screen size I’ll resize the image to fit those dimensions. \n\nWhen I do this I save the mobile size image with the same name as the desktop version but with a -m at the end of the file name. \n\nThen I compress them with compressor.io and save those new files in the images folder and overwrite them with the new smaller versions. This saves up to 80% of the file size with minimal Loss in quality. \n\nhttps://compressor.io\n\nThen I convert all my images to webp with this service \n\nhttps://cloudconvert.com/jpg-to-webp\n\nWebp format images load 1.5 times faster than jog and 2.5 times faster than png. You should be using webp format images for everything now. It’s key to getting 100. \n\nMOBILE LANDING PAGE TRICK\n\nOne thing I do to minimize the load times on mobile is I will take the normal desktop image and crop out the center of the image like 500px wide like this:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xcJ3osL.jpg\n\nBecause why should you have to load all that extra part of the image to the left and right when it’s just gonna be off screen anyway? So I make a special Crop of the center of the image to use for mobile screens and load the full sized image on desktop. This neat little trick saves you a lot of space and helps load a lot faster without having to stretch an image to fit it. Then I compress and convert to webp. I only do this for the landing page because it can’t lazy load so I make it as small as possible by cropping it to be the same width as a phone screen with no waste. But you can do this for all background images that need to be tall and thin. \n\nBecause older safari browsers don’t support webp, you can use this script to replace all .webp with .jpg if you have the jpgs inside your images folder as fallbacks. But the images can’t be served as background images in css. It only applies to img tags in the html. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/sfnx7x/_/hurxscm/?context=1\n\nRELATIVELY UNKNOWN TRICK\n\none thing I learned that not many people know about is preloading the mobile version of your landing page image in the head tag to reduce load times. I your head tag, put this code \n\n<link rel=\"preload\" as=\"image\" href=\"landing-m.webp\">\n\nPreload lets you tell the browser about critical resources that you want to load as soon as possible, before they are discovered in HTML. This is great for background images and fonts. Which we will get to later. Preload your mobile landing page background image on every page. It will improve your load times and they get served faster. \n\nLAZY LOAD!\n\nLazy load all your images below the fold, meaning everything that Isn’t seen on the screen when your website loads. Below the fold refers to the bottom of your screen. Everything image Below that, put the attribute loading=“lazy” on them. This will lazy load them in the browser. \n\nAlso, something I never knew about before, put decoding=“async” on EVERY image tag on your site. The decoding=\"async\" attribute will tell the browser that it is OK for image decoding to be done at a later moment so that the browser can continue displaying content even if the images are not fully loaded. This also helps Load your images in a more Optimal manner. \n\nOn your picture element, you add these attributes to the img tag after the source tag, as seen in my code example i referenced earlier. \n\nAlso don’t forget to add your alt text and height and width attributes. \n\nLAZY LOAD BACKGROUND IMAGES\n\nThere’s libraries and stuff for lazy loading background images but here’s how I do it in html and css without them. \n\nYou set your picture element at the bottom of your sections outermost div where you would want a background image on, outside of any content containers. \n\nLike this. \n\nsection\n    Container \n        Content \n    /container \n    Picture element\n/section\n\nSet that outer section div to position relative and z index 1. Add a class to your picture element to target it. Absolutely position the picture tag inside the section container with a height and width of 100% and top and left value of 0. Now it will take up the entire width and height of the section and cover it, and z-index: -1 so it’s behind all the content. In your css, target your image inside your picture element either by:\n\npicture img {} or by the .pictureClass img {} and set the image values to \n\nposition:absolute;\nheight: 100%;\nwidth: 100%;\ntop: 0;\nleft: 0;\nobject-fit: cover;\n\nThis will make the image act like a background image and cover the entire height and width of the picture element tag which is basically just a semantic div wrapper around your image. The negative Z index on the picture tag will place it behind all the content in the container and the z index of 1 on the container will prevent it from going behind the body and not being visible. \n\nDon’t forget to make a 500px wide crop of your background image for mobile, compress, convert to webp, and lazy load and add the decoding attribute too and the boom! A lazy loaded background image that serves up a smaller sized mobile image on phones. \n\nWhat’s basically happening is the picture tag is acting like a div around the image tag. We make the picture element absolutely positioned to be the same height and width of the main container in which we want a background image, then we make the image stretch to cover its container (the picture element) and it looks exactly like a background image, except the image tag can take the lazy loading and decoding attribute. \n\nThis technique will SIGNIFICANTLY improve your load times if you normally load desktop images as backgrounds on mobile and don’t resize or compress or convert. Lazing loading background images is a great way to shed some dead weight and improve your scores even more. \n\nI know this may seem like a lot of work but it’s really not once you commit it to your workflow. It goes by fast and your scores will jump up dramatically by serving up your images like this. \n\nPRO TIP!\n \nGo to fiver and find a good svg graphic designer. Have them convert your clients png logos into svgs for like $20 and Load those instead on your website. Loading svgs for logos on mobile is a huge boost and looks much better. It’s totally worth it. I do this for ALL of my clients, complimentary. They love it and it makes mobile load faster and look better. Do it! I load them in via a regular image tag. \n\nHOW TO OPTIMIZE FONTS\n\nThis is a huge pain point for a lot of people. And I’m going to show you how to locally host your fonts, how to fix “flash of unstyled content”, and preload them for faster loading. \n\nFirst, DONT go to google fonts. Go to google fonts helper. And try to only use 2 fonts max with as few font weights as possible to minimize the file sizes you have to load. \n\nhttps://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts\n\nSearch for the font you need and select it \n\nThen select the font weights you need. For the best performance, I like to only use 400 and 700. I let the browser estimate the rest. It’s called faux styling and it’s when the browser applies its best guess to the weight and italics. So for minimal load sizes, choose 400 and 700. \n\nThen where it says copy css, click on “modern browsers” to get the modern code. Underneath the css box there’s even an option to customize the file path to your fonts folder. \n\nCopy and paste that css into your css stylesheet that will be shared on all your pages on the website. Then don’t forget to add font-display: swap; inside your font face declarations. I usually just plop it right after the font weight on all font face declarations. \n\nThen download your fonts from the click to download button at the bottom. Unzip the folder and dump them in your /fonts folder. \n\nCongratulations. You just locally hosted your fonts! No more google fonts cdn. \n\nNow you need to preload the font with this code you put in the head right under your image preload link \n\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/assets/Pacifico-Bold.woff2\" as=\"font\" type=\"font/woff2\" crossorigin>\n\nChange the file path to the file path for your font. This will help a ton when your website loads and should be standard practice for all pages from here on out. \n\nFIX FLASH OF UNSTYLED CONTENT\n\nSometimes you’ll get a content layout shift of like .004s because of your landing page text. What’s happening is the browser loads its system default font first and then swaps it out for the @font-face fonts you’re loading in. How do we fix this?\n\nWe set the fallback font in your font family declaration to a system default font that most closely matches its size and shape. We do that with a font style matcher that you can use here:\n\nhttps://meowni.ca/font-style-matcher/\n\nHere’s a good list of browser default fonts to use. Scroll down to see what they all look like \n\nhttps://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-safe-html-css-fonts\n\nSo on the font style to be matched on the right side you upload the font you’re using on the home page from your /fonts folder and you’ll see at the bottom there will be text showing that font. On the left you type in the browser default font from the list I linked and find the one that most closely matches that size. If you’re text on the home page is 20px set both fonts to 20px with your slider. Then check to see that their line heights match up too. I use a small terminal widow or something and line up the bottom of the text lines to make sure they are perfect with the top edge of that terminal window. That’s how I like things up. If they’re off by a pixel or two I change the line height of my websites text on the right to match the height of the browser default font on them left. Once i have it perfect, I change the line height of that text to match what I found in the font style matcher.\n\nSo if I had Lato as a font for my site. My fallback font would be Arial. I’ve tested it already. So it’d look like this \n\nfont-family: \"Lato\", Arial, serif;\n\nThere you have it. No more content layout shift from your landing page content and no more “flash of unstyled content” errors. They will Load seamlessly. Took me forever to find this solution and it really works. It was frustrating me to no end why I’m getting the errors and this is how you solve it! It will take some trial and error and you’ll have to do it it twice if you have a bold h1 on top of regular weight h2 or they’re different font sizes. Tweak their line heights using Ems. I start adjusting my the hundredths sometimes. Like 1.49em and if it’s still a little off I’ll do 1.47em to shift them very carefully until into perfect. \n\nGOOGLE ANALYTICS\n\nYou can asynchronously load analytics with this code \n\nhttps://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs#alternative_async_tag\n\nAnd put it at the bottom of your head tag. This will significantly reduce its impact on your load times from google analytics. \n\nMINIFY YOUR CSS ANS JS\n\nI use Netlify to host all my static sites and they have options in my build and deploy settings to Minify my css and js. So that’s neat. But there are other options out there to do it. Just make sure you’re doing it. It will help reduce the size of those files. \n\nUSE SVGS WHEREVER POSSIBLE\n\nI use flaticon to customize and download thousands of SVGs that I use for my projects. Best $10 a month I ever spend. \n\nhttps://www.flaticon.com\n\nI serve them up in image tags so it cleans up the DOM and is easier to manage. So like your social media icons and phone and email icons, icon graphics for cards, etc. svg as much as you can. \n\nThen I optimize all my svgs with this tool\n\nhttps://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/\n\nYes you’d an even optimize svgs! Save as much space as you can. \n\nDEFER NONESSENTIAL JAVASCRIPT\n\nIf your js files don’t need to execute for the page to Load properly then place them at the bottom of your body and add the defer attribute to them so they defer their loading till after the website has loaded and they don’t “render block” it and prevent the website from loading because they has to execute first. \n\nREMOVE JQUERY AND OTHER 3RD PARTY SCRIPTS\n\nIf you can, remove any third party scripts you don’t really need like JQuery. JavaScript has come a long way and can do many of the things JQuery used to only do. I reworked my clients sites to not use JQuery anymore and it helps jump up your page speed and security. It’s time to start moving away from JQuery if you haven’t already. \n\nAnd that’ll do it. Once you do all of this it will get you closer to 100 than you’ve ever been. I’ve had a couple people reach out to me to tell me my methods helped them get to their first 100 and they didn’t think it was possible. But it is! And I wanted to share with everyone how I do it for real websites with lots of images and content, not just for sites with mostly text and not a lot of content. You can have a full fledged website and score 100 page speed scores if you follow these best practices. Hope this helps, try it out and see for yourself!",

        "selftext": "# Howdy r/web_design.\n\n[u/shepbryan](https://www.reddit.com/user/shepbryan) here, long-time Squarespace builder and digital creator.\n\n**This year I've seen lots of posts exploring the merits/limits of Squarespace 7.1.** \n\nToday I'm sharing a website overhaul case study that might be useful to some of you as you consider whether to make the swap. *As a quick aside, I've already built 5 or 6 sites on Squarespace 7.1  during the quarantine so I'm pretty familiar with the new platform's pros and cons. I've also built around 30 sites on Squarespace 7. Feel free to AMA in the comments if you have any questions of your own.*\n\n# First: a little bit of the big picture.\n\nI'm currently the Creative Director at TomiLlama.com, a digital-first self-help project my family launched in 2017. We are a top Google result for tons of keywords related to personal growth.\n\nWhen we first launched our brand and website on Squarespace, we didn't know what we were doing. Over time, we developed a strong understanding of the search intent behind new visits to our site.\n\nOnce we started to align our blogging strategy with that intent, our site took off. The last 18 months have been a rocketship of organic growth via search, and in 2020 we've already had 45,000+ unique visitors and about \\~950 new email signups in the last 30 days...\n\nWith this deeper knowledge of the intent behind our visits, (and knowing  that we're planning our first e-course launch for July) I figured it was  time to revamp our CSS-laden [TomiLlama.com](https://tomillama.com/) from Squarespace 7 (Rally template) and make some crucial improvements.\n\nWhile building the previous website in 2018, I only had a basic understanding of UI/UX principles and SEO/CRO best practices. Over time the site got a little better with tweaks here and there, but eventually, it had become a CSS Frankensite.\n\nI had to be painfully careful with my styling changes because I might randomly break something on a page without realizing for days or weeks.\n\nStill,  by matching our site's content to customer intent we were able to overcome a mediocre site layout and deliver clear value to visitors,  reaching email signup rates of 5-8% on our top blog posts.\n\n# My hypothesis for rebooting the site was that if we tackled the following objectives, we would see a lift in our website KPIs of time on page, pages per session, and email signups:\n\n1. *Create a more consistent blog layout with value-centric CTA's for our lead magnets*\n2. *Distill the sitemap to our key pages and simplify our nav menu options*\n3. *Improve our internal link structure to connect the dots for visitors (and search engine crawlers) on our related blog topics*\n\nAs  I got started planning the new site, the decision became one of building out a new version of the old site on Rally again, but scrubbing much of our clunky custom CSS, useless meta tags, weak image captions,  etc...\n\nOR\n\nTackling the reboot on a fresh Squarespace 7.1 template and simply leaning into the new aesthetic + builder functionality, troubleshooting along the way, and trusting in the process.\n\n# I ultimately decided Squarespace 7.1 was the way to go, and here is some of my reasoning.\n\n**With our 7.0 site,**  we couldn't incorporate our design system into the website aesthetic very easily... we basically had to choose between one or two colors at all times because by default you either have your background color or  you have an alternate color that is overlaid on whatever background  image you've uploaded. The 7.0 Squarespace builder isn't very versatile  for someone who wants to build a website with a variety of  customizations without getting into the use of CSS/Javascript.\n\n**With 7.1, you can get more granular control over your site design before you need to use CSS.**  More specifically – with the Color option added to the new Design page  layout, we were able to create section layouts with very specific design  customizations.\n\nFor example, we don't use our alternate color of dark purple on our default palette very frequently... or ever actually.\n\nSo  I took that specific Color option and fully customized it with a unique newsletter block layout, image block layouts, a different color background, etc.\n\nBasically with  7.1, you can make independent customizations for different elements in  each color palette. That's up to 10 on-call page design themes you can  potentially work with while building a site, or even a single page!  Sure, Squarespace defaults these palettes to automatically match the  colors you've selected... but you can absolutely break that mold and  repurpose the palette system for your own creative benefit. I used the  specific customized section I mentioned for our lead magnets so site  visitors who hit multiple pages get a consistent experience.\n\n# An interesting twist: I opted to manually build our blogs out as pages, instead of using the actual Blog page layout provided by Squarespace and a /blog URL slug:\n\nThis may seem like a strange thing to people unfamiliar with Squarespace, but working within the limitations that are baked into the Squarespace platform often becomes a constraint you need to creatively address. For example, blogging on Squarespace generally requires you to use a page type called... \"Blog\". However, the Blog page format is not very versatile in terms of page design.\n\nSo there are two reasons for me choosing to build my own blog page layout with breadcrumb navigation.\n\n**The first is that the new index page builder in Squarespace 7.1 is extremely powerful.**  It's highly customizable (see previous explanation of using various  color palette themes on the same page) and I feel empowered to make a  beautiful layout when I look at it. Drawing inspiration from Brian  Dean's site Backlinko, I made sure our blogs each had clear section  titles with anchor links as well as alternating color backgrounds in the  body text of our content.\n\nThe  hypothesis here is that the visual separation of information makes it  easier for readers to chunk and consume. It's extremely clear as you  scroll down one of our blogs that there is a finite number of sections  that are smartly labeled, and the general impression for new visitors is  that the info is well-organized and easy-to-access. This is something  that would be a massive pain in the ass to do on Squarespace's default  blog page layout. The caveat here is that now I need to set up Disqus  for each blog page if I want to regain the use of a comments section on  our blogs. Still troubleshooting this piece.\n\n**The  second is that in terms of page weight for SEO, Squarespace weighs home  pages at 1.0, standard pages at .75, and blog posts at .5.** By manually  creating my own blog page structure with breadcrumb navigation, our  best content will now be weighted more heavily in the eyes of search  engines (at .75 instead of .5). I'm not entirely sure about the science  behind this, but I couldn't find anything telling me NOT to do this and  as far as sitemaps go I could see that high-ranking sites like [backlinko.com](https://backlinko.com/) and [jamesclear.com](https://jamesclear.com/)  don't have /blog in their URL slugs either. I'm no supreme SEO god, so  don't take this as a divine mandate. Again, it's just personal  experience and good research leading me to this decision.\n\n# Overall, the new site is blowing the old one away on all of our KPIs.\n\nFor us the swap has been absolutely worth it, bugs included.\n\n**Breakdown of my goals, the post-launch results, and my checklist for getting there.**\n\n**Goal 1:** Improve our rate of email signups with better blog layouts & clear CTAs for our lead magnets\n\n**Goal 2:** Keep people on our site longer with more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user experience\n\n**Goal 3:** Simplify our design & content management system\n\n**Goal 4:** Make it visually clear that Tomi Llama is a world-class digital brand in the self-help industry\n\n**Results after launching:**\n\n* \\+75% increase in form submissions on [TomiLlama.com](https://tomillama.com/) from 307/week before to 537/week after.\n   * This  metric is measured in Squarespace's analytics and it's very useful from  a CRO perspective. It tells us what specific forms were submitted,  which page they are on, as well as the # of unique views, submissions,  and the conversion rate for each form. Some of our forms are now  converting at >18%! 😮\n* \\+37% increase in actual Mailchimp subscribers from 210/week to 288/week.\n   * The  big disparity between form submissions / new subscribers is due to Tomi  Llama superusers who sign up for multiple lead magnets during a site  visit. Our new site is more intuitive to explore, and we define each  lead magnet's value in a prominent location on-page.\n* \\+22% average session duration\n   * Most  of our essential pages now average over 1min per session. We  restructured the information on each blog post to follow a similar  system that lets readers go as deep as they want on a topic. Simpler  content at the top, deeper stuff towards the bottom.\n* \\+18% overall page view\n   * Users  are finding it easier to explore more of our site since our internal  linking structure dramatically improved with our blog revamps\n\n**My checklist for reaching this goal:**\n\n* Review  our highest converting forms to see what insights I could gain about  alignment between the content and the perceived value of a lead magnet\n* Review  actual anonymous user visits to the site using Lucky Orange, an  analytics tool. I was able to see heatmaps of user interactions on our  pages to learn what was being clicked and what was being ignored, how  far down a page the average user was scrolling, as well as understand  how new users were exploring the site. From there, I tried to condense  all the best parts into the higher visibility parts of the blog.  Basically, if only 25% of people were actually scrolling down to  discover the lead magnet, we were functionally losing 75% of visitors  who didn't even know there was more value for them to receive. We now  have lead magnet forms in the first 10% of the scroll on all posts.\n* Study  some of the best SEO-oriented websites on the internet to understand  how they structure their content to look good and also hit their on-page  SEO keywords. I heavily dug into Brian Dean's site, Backlinko.com, for  inspiration. You'll notice our blog layout is adapted from Brian's  fantastic definitive guides, down to the alternating background  sections.\n* Map  our entire site's SEO plan using Airtable. This way I could see that we  were hitting all the appropriate keywords for H1/H2 and body text.\n* Use  Ahrefs to scour the top pieces of content for our best keywords and  effectively incorporate the best of the best into our own materials.  This tool also gives you an idea of how easy it can be to create a  definitive piece of content that's better than what else is out there.  Without Ahrefs, I would still have this looming sense that I'm missing  something or that someone else is going to outpace us with better  content. Ahrefs Content Explorer let me easily review hundreds of blog  posts across our niche, and ultimately I came away feeling really good  about the quality of our own content.\n* Use  Ahrefs again to audit our site once it was live to find any broken  links I may have missed. I ended up finding 4 broken links, 4 incorrect  redirects, and a handful of anchor links that needed a little update.  This was the final house-keeping piece of the site launch for me.\n\n**My findings from the research and review stage:**\n\nThe  old site ultimately wasn't very intuitive to navigate – our nav menu  included slugs like \"Llama Store\" and \"Meet Tomi\" that were unfamiliar  and thus not compelling to new visitors. Additionally, there were so  many different things in the overall UI of the site and our blog posts  that NO ONE was clicking. I'm talking ZERO people clicking a button,  link, image, product, etc., out of thousands of visits. So I decided we  would streamline and build out the new site around what was working the  best for us – our top six blogs / lead magnets.\n\nRather  than peppering forms throughout our blogs willy-nilly and hoping  someone might sign up, we restructured our blogs to follow a 3-step  informative process that is logical for someone who is first exploring a  topic and also useful for someone who is returning to explore again. We  added anchor links and clear section titles to all content. And we  added a lead magnet signup at the top of each blog, and again around the  30-50% mark of a blog.\n\nWith this  new structure, each section has a clear explanation of the value to the  reader that also ties back to our lead magnets.\n\nThe  results have blown me away. Before our new site was live, we saw  between 250-300 form submissions per week as measured via Squarespace's  Form Analytics. At the end of the rainbow, this was resulting in roughly  180-200 new subscribers being added to our Mailchimp list weekly. The  true tally of new subscribers has never aligned with our actual forms  submitted tally on Squarespace, due to users signing up for multiple  lead magnets during one visit. I won't say there's any sort of maxim you  can extrapolate from this for your own venture – it's just what I've  learned to expect from the Tomi Llama audience.\n\nWith  the new site live, our first week of submissions totaled 537 form subs  on Squarespace and 288 new subscribers in Mailchimp. Compared to the  week before our site launch which had 307 form subs on Squarespace and  about 210 new subs in Mailchimp. Some quick maths here to get the  increase in conversion rates:\n\n**Our increase in on-site form submissions is \\~75% (537/307=1.749)**\n\n**Our increase in new subscribers is \\~37% (288/210=1.371)**\n\nThis  wasn't a fluke by any means. We planned out our digital overhaul and  executed it with zero hiccups. Even flipping our old site over to our  new site had less than 1 hour of downtime, meaning we lost minimal  subscribers during that down hour on our site. Once the site was fully  live, I made sure to submit the new sitemap to Google Search Console and  do a site audit with Ahrefs.\n\n# Here's what I attribute these improvements to:\n\n* **Significantly better UI/UX**\n* **A deeper understanding of our customer journey.**  The goal for us at this point is to give people amazing free content,  offer them a supplementary resource that improves their experience with  the free content in some way, and add them to our email list. We're  launching a premium e-course next quarter that is built specifically for  our 5k+ subscribers.\n* **High level of clarity for site visitors as to what the value we are offering them is**… breaking it down with smart copy and clear value propositions with our lead magnets\n* **Better creative.**  I've been working with an illustrator/watercolorist in Atlanta for the  past few years to create Tomi's signature Studio Ghibli-esque aesthetic.  On this project, everything finally came together. I had lots of great  resources like hi-res watercolor paintings, vector graphics of our llama  characters, and many digital mockups of our physical goods like books,  values cards, and worksheets.\n* **And yes, building on Squarespace 7.1**!  I love the new Squarespace builder. I've already built 5-6 sites using  it and it makes it much easier to maintain a consistent brand aesthetic  across many different web pages. I used the new Color palette feature to  create a series of customized page layouts that my other team members  can easily replicate as our site continues to grow and expand with new  content. I think ultimately 7.1 represents a leap forward in terms of  using Squarespace to underpin the design systems of a business. 7.1  makes establishing that system a much easier process than before. Just  be sure you take notes while you design so other's can replicate the  work.\n\n# Bugs I observed during the project:\n\n* For some reason our billing is buggy and won't update to recognize a new credit card. I've contacted support.\n* During  the site swap, the first time I submitted the sitemap to Google I got  an error. I assume this was because there was a hiccup in our */sitemap.xml* link from Squarespace as the site got flipped over. I waited 6 hours and resubmitted successfully.\n* For  some reason about 0.5% of form submissions return a \"form submission  error\" even though we've double-checked all our form connections to  Mailchimp/Zapier. I usually add these folks manually and send them their  lead magnet personally.\n* The  analytics page isn't showing Mailchimp referrals very effectively... if  100 people click a link via email and arrive on the site, the unique  Mailchimp click ID only registers a couple of visitors in the referral  section of our analytics.\n\nHopefully this breakdown of our site revamp is helpful to you as you consider whether to make something on Squarespace 7.1.\n\nAsk me questions in the comments and I'll do my best to reply!",

And criteria in minds of rich guys might be unpredictable. So be open, talk more and always try to help peoples first at least with real good advices (even small). If it is good advices they will clearly understand you are expert.\n\n- Same with hired employees. Filter more and more. Find hardworking guys. Sometimes even astrology might help you to understand it. Test tasks are also good.\n\n- Pay employees by hourly rate salaries. Use tool like https://tracklify.com to track executors time using randomized 10 minute screenshots. Better improve the rate, but Pay for real proven work. Not for vacations and other things. They will much better understand their value if they will feel you pay for every hour of their work. Also same tool can be used to create hourly invoices for clients.",

                "body": "So To start I decided on a niche market to target. Then I searched theme forest to find some Wordpress themes I liked in that space and made 3 templates myself in html and css based on those themes. 1 simple one for those businesses that don’t need or want much, then one middle of the road one that has more style, is modern without being TOO fancy. It’s just a Nice looking site that can be used by anyone. Then my third is a higher end looking design that looks like it’d fit with a more expensive or luxury brand company in this niche I targeted. This way I can target all types of businesses within my niche and have options. A higher end client won’t like the simple template, and Vice versa. \n\nI used these three templates to expand my business. I’d sell all three in a market, which is like a 2 hour radius. Don’t wanna sell the same template in an area. Once I sell all three in an area I find somewhere else in the state or another state and sell three more in that area. Eventually I’d run into people who didn’t like any of my templates and I had to design new ones that fit their tastes and added that yo my arsenal of templates. \n\nSlowly I expanded the number of templates I have to 10+ And expanded into various industries like behavioral health, debt collection, restaurants, and logistics. \n\nWith these templates I was able to expand rapidly by focusing more on sales rather than development. Most I’ve done in a week was 5 new clients start to finish in 7 days. That was a wild week. But my workflow allows me to do it. It would be impossible to do that if I built 5 custom websites. I spend 3-5 hours per new site adding the new content and optimizing it’s page speed. What’s great is they are actually really really good products. Why reinvent the wheel every client? I use the same responsive navigation for all my sites so I’m not starting over from nothing. And when I make new designs I only do a home page. All my interior pages are templates and I use the same pages for everyone. Studies show no one gives a shit about them. So I made simple interior page templates that I use for all my clients. So when I do have to design and develop a new page I’m only doing a home page, which significantly reduces the amount of time I have to design and code. I can’t code an entire home page now in less than 8 hours. So even when I have to design a develop a new site it only takes me maybe 8 hours to do it. Which is 3 more than it takes to fill in and optimize a template. So the time invested is not as much as normal developers time invested. Where it might take them 40 hours to do a new custom 5 page website from scratch I can do it in less than 10. Sometimes even less. It’s all about templetizing the work that is repetitive and spending your time more wisely where it gets the most return for the investment. I’m really not trying to be cocky when I say this but I can do more working my business part time than others can do full time. It’s because of the process, templating, and not rebuilding things that I already built. \n\nAs a disclaimer, it took me a while to actually build my first templates, probably a week or two. Which is typical. But Over time I have perfected making static sites to the point I am now wrapping up one of my current newly designed homepages in 3-4 hours, mobile to desktop. Everything. I learned a new method of coding responsive websites that is saving me 30-40% of my time and I have never seen it used before online or in any tutorials. I will be making a YouTube playlist of me building a whole website with this method and I think it will surprise some people. \n\nHope this was helpful!",

I live in South Africa and I assume small businesses here will be detered by a subscription model, but I could be wrong!\n\nWhy do think the clients stay on and spend more money than they would (in the long term, if they're confident their business will be around in a few years) if they paid for a professional website of equal quality in 2 installments and then spent less per month for hosting and support service? If they can't afford it upfront I don't see the logic in spending more over-time and carrying more expenses, as opposed to taking a loan.",

If you're scaling the clients, you're scaling the amount of support calls and troubleshooting time, which is a bit daunting from my current perspective.

How many clients do you currently have and how much of pain in the ass is the support? Are you receiving calls during leisure time forcing you to exit and jump onto a laptop? If the site goes down on Sunday, do you reply on Monday or are you on call legit 24/7? 24/7 support sounds great to the client, but scary for the service provider to deliver, and a little stressful knowing you may be called to action at any moment, with the probability increasing with business growth?",

Many providers have an \"only password\" page that pulls the username from a cookie, that's great assuming you've reached that state of the application but that shouldn't be the sole method for entering a password. I think it might be a little bit of laziness and OCD from developers not wanting to \"repeat themselves\" with two different routes for password input. \"We have a username page and a password page, not a username/password page and a password page.\"\n\nEvery other login situation can already be covered with SSO buttons and cookies for token authentication. Removing the password from the login screen is one less feature, not one more feature.",

Your timing is probably quite right as this is when new SSO trends and better security practices were rolled out by major companies.     These products need to support many services across many devices, and most of them do not require passwords to verify anything. For example, using any social login will handshake your already existing logged in account. Two-factor authentication will ask you to verify on another device. Finger print, well yeah. These cases all contribute to the need for entering passwords. As a result, the UI needs to update to reflect numerous scenarios any given user out of millions has to encounter. The trade off is a shift in how we do verifying on the web. Its a lot more secure these days and it's better for us. Quite a cool change and a nice design challenge if you ask me. I hate having to enter in my password if I can avoid it, and almost always log in using google 'one click button', knowing that my account is secure. When I worked with firebase I also realised that google keeps your login data rather than a third party, so it makes me feel even more secure (albeit you can just download your user tables, but at least its initially hosted elsewhere)",

In the past I would turn my manager's dashboard/management site into a PWA and they loved it, because it worked just like an app on their phone.\n\nThat part still works great, the problem is Apple and Google will try to make the experience very annoying for the developers.\n\nWe all know about Apple's hatred for PWA even though ironically they came up with the idea...\n\nGoogle used to be cool and there was a pipeline to turn your PWA into a native app for the google play store. That worked well for many years but I guess Google's new era of enshittification has no bounds.\n\nI have had my Google Play store dev account since 2016 and for some reason Google has removed my apps from the play store due to lack of new apps and or updates. The apps are done, there is nothing to update and I'm not doing an update for update's sake, that is just stupid.\n\nGoogle's \"alternative\" solution is that I give my address and phone number. Last time I gave Google my phone number through Youtube I started getting a lot of phone spam, Google was the only new entity to obtain my private phone number for a while, coincidence? Maybe but I doubt it.\n\nSo now the Google play store will hold my apps hostage until they can spam my number again. Yea fuck that and fuck google.\n\nThe beauty of a PWA and Web dev is that it can be accessed from a URL and it is not beholden to some rent seeking gated garden that makes the experience worse for the user.\n\nWeb > apps\n\nTL:DR Google is holding my play store apps hostage after being their for years in exchange for my phone number so they can send me phone spam.\n\nThank you for reading my Sunday rant.",

What are some do's and don'ts in regards to their portfolio? \n\nFor example some of the concerns that I have:\n\nAfter bachelors but before diploma I took a break from the educational grind. I've traveled for work around Europe. I can imagine some employers not liking the fact that I was absent from the industry for around 4 years. Others may see it differently, because after all, not everyone can pack up everything they own and move to a different country. I could argue that this has thought me to not fear change and obstacles. It thought me a lot of soft people's skills. Personally, I feel like I should outline this in my portfolio. But what do you think?\n\nI have also been a front-of-the-house manager in a hospitality business. Sure, that is unrelated in terms of industry. But managing people is still an experience. Do you think I should outline that in my portfolio as well?\n\nI am happy to hear all of your thoughts and suggestions.\n\nThank you kindly!",

You will be constantly evaluated (silently) on 3 things: how well do you communicate, how fast do you process new information and do you have the minimum knowledge required to do your job. No certificate in the world will overshadow those. Also for many us who are in their 30's and 40's, school has been so many years and milestones ago, we can't even related to who we were back then. Only people who talk about school are other juniors.\n\nI'd say focus really hard on 1 project. 2 polished demos is enough.  You just need proof of previous work and quality, that is it. Every company will have their own tools and workflows. The best thing you can do is to figure out their stack (job description + scrape employee info on linkedin) and do a tiny demo with their stack. That will really score points as every company hopes that the candidate will just fit with whatever they are using.\n\nDon't say that you want to become management. There are limited places at the table and the managers are really protective of their position. Asking for it will always come with resistance. Also, middle management sucks, except for the salary its a lousy job.

I can't see any benefit where either of those roles would overlap so I'd choose a direction you'd like to go. Even easier to wear only 1 cap if you're within an agency as you're paid to be more specialised. Its only when you're a freelancer that you may want to widen your offerings if you're struggling to fill your hours.\n\nHowever I do agree, 3 months of payroll would normally be accepted in a banks eyes for a mortgage... so I'd just get whatever you could for the highest income for 3 months, get the mortgage and then either look for a different job or side hustle a freelance career until you can quit your job.\n\nSome people aren't cut out to be freelancers though and much better suited to be employees. Theres no right or wrong but its VERY useful to be honest with yourself and decide which you are.\n\nMy finger in the air advice is still to try to firm up specifically what you want to do. I'm not sure what a junior role pays in your country but if its enough for a mortgage then just try and get a job doing that in say frontend coding or ux design or which ever sounds more interesting... off the back of that though you'd benefit from trying to solve a few real world problems (or at least 1) to put you in good stead for the interview.\n\nGood luck either way! and buy a good office chair!",

It turned out that it was a combination of minor details that got summed up together and produced the shitty result:\n\n1. I screwed the REM - I don't know where it turned sour, but it was my first time using Tailwind and before that, I think I had hard-coded 1 rem = 10px or sth like that (can't remember the tutorial) and on Tailwind it's 16px, so all my designs were a bit upscaled by the browser.\n2. I haven't properly cross-checked the design between my monitors. It turned out that the designs were very different on my secondary monitors vs. my main 4k monitor. I'm not sure where I fcked up, but now I know where to look for solutions.\n3. Firefox also added its three cents and some gradients aren't displaying properly, it seems.\n\nAt least I know I can hard-code some half-transparent gradients to smooth things out in strategic places and make the design viable now. Victory in the battle, though the war continues!\n\n// old post\n\nI'm a desinger who learned2code and I've starded coding websites for clients. I've got a stonemason as a client and I've developed some components in Photoshop that were using raster images to make the site look like a slab of sandstone with negative relief buttons. My design file is an absolute mess, so I won't share it, but let's say it looked like a painted, ancient Egyptian stone slab with carved in letters and blue and gold paint here and there.\n\nLet's pretend that the design in Photoshop looked decent - I decided it looks good and interesting. So I began to cut out the parts and use them as textures and background-images.\n\nIT ALL LOOKED LIKE SHIT\n\nLike, it was the exact same images, however in Photoshop it looked nice, but on website it was absolute trash. I think I saw something similar on some conspiracy page which looked like half-baked HTML code mixed with vomited CSS and google-imaged \"textures\" that retained the watermarks.\n\nMy theory is that it's the scaling issue, but I tried and tried to fix it and nothing good came out of it.\n\nDoes anyone know any resources on how to use raster textures in web-design? Or maybe it's a completely wrong route and I'm not gonna go far down this road?\n\nSo far I've rebuilt the website, simplified a lot of the code, managed to get some decent results with parts of the approach, but the buttons look bad. I get that simple 2D colors tend to be easy-to-use, but due to artistic fetish, I don't want to copy another bastardized material design. I'm using Tailwindcss as a back-bone, but I'm trying to style it heavily to make the site look interesting. It's about creating something artistic and unique for me.\n\nThanks in advance for help.",

If you take a 400px image and stretch it to 500px, it will look bad no matter what. If you have a 400px image, it will likely look good at 400px, 200px, 100px, etc. Always go down in size and never up, and preferably in powers of 2.\n\nAlso pay attention to DPR (Device Pixel Ratio). A lot of computers and phones these days use a high density display, which means that something that is 1px big in Photoshop might actually take up 2-4 physical pixels in real life. This means if you need an image that displays at 400px, then your Photoshop file needs to be at least 800px.\n\nLastly you can try playing around with the [CSS image-rendering property](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/i/image-rendering/).

        "author": "Ok-Stuff-8803",
        "id": "1jzer4b",
        "selftext": "How has this continued to be a thing, and how did this get approved internally?\n\nThe Shopify Admin UI is a complete mess. It's genuinely hard to believe this shipped — and worse, that it's still the current experience, worse yet they appear to have even double down on it.\n\nLet’s start with the **lack of contextual awareness**. Navigation feels arbitrary — features and settings are rarely where you’d logically expect them to be. It often feels like the structure was designed by people who never actually *use* the platform day-to-day.\n\nThe **UI design itself is objectively poor**. Even at launch, it was hard to use — small text, cramped layout, and non-distinct buttons. And then somehow, they made it even worse. Recent updates have shrunk font sizes further and tightened spacing, making things even more difficult to parse visually. There’s almost **no visual hierarchy**. Buttons, links, and interactive elements all blend together — which is baffling considering they often do *completely different things*.\n\nThe **card layout and spacing** are atrocious. Everything is packed into narrow containers a lot of the time, likely a result of trying to optimize for tablet screens or a minimum screen width — at the cost of usability on desktop, where most admins actually work but then they change their mind in other areas and fill the screen.\n\nThe **product management pages** have become a chaotic jumble of misaligned sections, inconsistent UI patterns, and hidden settings. It’s almost hostile to workflows.\n\nWhen you switch to something like the **Analytics** section, you get a bit of UI breathing room — but then you realize that the **data is wrong**. Regularly. We've had clients come to us confused or panicked over metrics that make no sense, only for us to discover that Shopify's data was just flat-out inaccurate. We’ve had to implement Google Analytics or other third-party tracking solutions *just to get reliable numbers*.\n\nThe whole interface is also **visually dead**. Everything is grey. There’s no visual differentiation, no personality, and no cues to guide the eye. It’s not just boring — it’s inefficient.\n\nAnd don’t get me started on **basic navigation failings**. You’d think “Pages” would be part of “Content,” right? Nope. Go to the Content section, and there are no Pages. Instead, to access Pages (along with Themes and Preferences), you have to:\n\n1. Click on **Sales Channels**\n2. Wait for a **popup modal**\n3. Select **Online Store**\n4. And *then* magically, those items appear in the nav\n\nHow does that make any logical UX sense? It’s a puzzle hunt just to find basic tools. It is not as if the menu is packed with items, it is so small and packed into that top corner as if they were desperate for space when it isn't.  \nAnd finally, it is yet another company tacking in A.I features which seems completely hopeless across the board a lot of the time because it has been implemented so quick and dirty.",

Have you looked at other managed providers, contacted anyone? \n\n  \nSome host's have certain limits i.e php workers etc or traffic wise etc so things can add up quickly so got to be careful.\n\n  \nIn regards to price, are you looking to pay per site or have a monthly budget in mind knowing that if you go above x amount it'll be raised a little?\n\n  \nDo any sites require dedicated IP's? Any emails other than gmail workspace? \n\n  \nWhat does 24/7 support mean to you, i.e how would you normally contact a host? Is 24/7 phone support a must?\n\n  \nMost host's do 30 days backup retention backed by daily backups, have you thought about doing backups yourself too and storing it offline somewhere?",

There might be aspects I don't know how to design or implement yet, but if I feel like I can undertake them, it's ok. However, if I get the sense that I don't even know how to approach a specific problem, even after taking some time to research it, I don't continue.\n\nThen I try to establish from the beginning a general idea of how the website would look and feel by either creating a mockup or providing similar website designs. I'm only referring to structure/layout and functions, not visual style, colours, images, shadows, etc. I also don't spend that much time on this.\n\nI know some people tend to take weeks to establish even the mockup. I mainly talk with the person and kinda figure all this out that way. Usually I present a general idea and we talk about that specifically and make notes on it.\n\nAfter that, I try to come up with some questions regarding particular aspects that I think they might need in the future but are not foreseeing, because it's not their field.\n\n* Who uses the website. This is to get an idea of the audience, to be able to determine how detailed the UI elements, responsive design should be.\n* How old is the target audience. Younger people tend to adapt faster to (slightly) unusual design, so it gives me some room to play in with the visual style.\n* How used is the audience with this type of website. This tells me that they're used to seeing and using UIs, so I don't need to simplify forms a lot and things like that.\n* If the audience is mainly mobile or mainly desktop. I know the general consensus is that we should be building UIs mobile first, meaning that we should always assume that the mobile interface is more important than desktop, but that tends to leave desktop UIs a bit lacking. I want to optimise with the main target in mind and then scale in either direction.\n* And more which I can't think of right now.\n\nYou'll usually create this bullet point list on your own once you gather some experience. Generally everything that you're going to ask for at least a second project, you'll remember and it'll come up on the next project.\n\nDon't stress too much about creating a list like this either.

Also alongside this, if the client has a website already then review all of his pages, content and make a mental note of what content needs to be on the page.\n\nWhen ready to create the design, either first structure it like a wireframe and get approval from the client before progressing, or if you feel confident in your abilities, begin adding the content to the website design and let your mind run free with creation.\n\n--* Ignore Below if you do not do development *--\nIf your a developer, I have found that it's best to reuse things you have created before. If for example the Web design needs a quirky image with text next to it and a ghost button, see if you have developed anything similar for a previous client, and if so create the design of that section around the design you have already built. This makes it more time efficient as you can just copy and paste the code which is fully responsive and needs minimal changes added to it. I used to design everything from scratch but I've come to realise, client A doesn't care if a section on his site looks like client B (who is in a completely different work industry), and once you change the colours and images around they most likely wouldn't even notice anyway.",

So my process ends up being a bit more collaborative because they often have to make assets themselves.\n\n \n\n* 1. Contract Phase\n   * Jobs usually start with a conversation, often informal, where I get an elevator pitch for what they want. \n   * I then schedule a time to have a longer exploration conversation with them\n   * I have an intake form I either send to the client directly or fill in while we chat over a voice call\n   * If I can't immediately picture what they want and they're struggling to tell me, I ask them to build a mood board or send me inspiration images\n   * I also ask them to drop any current assets (logos, photos) they have into a  dropbox I set up for us. I usually request they give it to me in a \"layered file\" (Tif, PSD). Just saying \"Give me a PSD\" sometimes resulted in them giving me a flattened, unusable file.\n* 2. Wireframes Phase\n   * I draw up very basic greyscale wireframes in Figma and explain to the client that need to start with structure: what's in the site and where\n   * I either ask them to leave comments on the Figma directly or go over them with the client in a meeting, depending on their needs\n   * Around here is when I pick a font to use on the site with them. Fonts tend to be a good trial run of how much input the client wants, how they want to work with me, and how detail oriented they are. \n   * If we settle on a font I slot that in here as a stepping stone into..\n* 3. Medium Fidelity\n   * That's my weird term for \"roughs\" or when we start adding aesthetics like color and images.\n   * First I explain what these are to the client. \n   * Then that we do this so I can isolate problems the client doesn't know how to tell me about color, aesthetics, etc. \n   * I repeat a few polishing rounds, depending on project scope\n* 4. Launch Phase\n   * I used to call this \"final\" but websites are rarely \"done\" (and it stressed out some clients).\n   * When we're closer to launch I touch base with the client on anything that's changed since our first conversation in the contract phase. \n   * I do my final touches the client doesn't need spelled out for them (optimize images, bug fixes they don't notice, etc)\n   * I pack everything up into a big folder in our shared dropbox both for my reference and their archival use later\n   * Launch the site on agreed date.\n   * Email the client when done, pointing them to the backup of the files, asking them to check the site one final time (cause there's always something). \n   * I then keep a loose eye on it for a few days after launch, just in case. In the contract I lay out how long my support lasts for the site before it's a separate contract, but I feel like things only come up in the first 1-2 weeks after launch. \n\nAnd that should do it!

Do the same for things that you require from the client and add sending and receiving it from the client to your overall checklist.\n\nAlso, one tip I love giving people and telling clients about is this.  Focus your content on AIDA. AIDA - getting their ATTENTION, getting them INTERESTED, arousing their DESIRE and getting them to ACT.\n\nTo do this and get your content right, you want to focus on your business benefits.  \n\nWhen you think of the business benefits, consider the feature of the business and then the benefit it provides, e.g. for a house/pet sitter it would be:\n\nWe will feed and play with your dog (feature) which means you can have a stress free holiday knowing your pet will be well looked after (benefit)\n\nWe will collect your mail and put out your bins (features) which means we not only care for your pet but your house is more secure as it looks like it's lived in (benefit)\n\nWhen you focus your clients website copy on benefits, the conversion rate is much higher than their competitors who simply list what their services are.  When you read a website like that it's uninspiring, you know you need that service, but you have to think for yourself when it comes to the benefits they bring.  If you TELL the website reader the benefits, they'll make a decision on the spot based on this, and are far more likely to sign up/buy your service.\n\nHope that helps!!",

Do this first, so everything is shaped around what makes the site work for them.\n2. **Learning** – Gather insights from analytics, existing traffic, marketing, and the current site. Learn what’s working, what’s not, and why.\n3. **Clarify Aim** – Define clear goals based on your audience and insights. I like one primary goal, a few supporting ones, and even “anti-goals” — things to avoid.\n4. **Hierarchy** – Map out the structure and navigation of the site. This can be a simple list or a full diagram. Expect this to evolve as your thinking develops.\n5. **Essential Features** – List out everything the site needs (e-commerce, CRM integration, etc.). Rank features by priority and tie them back to your goals.\n6. **Mapping** – Plan each page (or type of page): what it’s for, what’s on it, and how it contributes to your goals. I often work backwards from key pages like product or service pages — this helps shape the pages above.\n7. **Yield** – The final plan. Not just a brief, but a blueprint for the project: structure, features, and even tech choices. This helps with selecting developers, managing the build, and staying on track.\n\nMuch of the value is in the process — getting clarity, aligning goals, challenging assumptions, and forming a solid plan. We've refined this over years of projects, and it works. \n\nWe’ve wrapped it all up in a free guide called **ALCHEMY Website Planning** – just Google it to download. No catch. Just something that might save you time, money, and headaches.\n\nHappy to answer any questions if helpful 😊\n\nMarcus",

        "selftext": "Hello all, \n\nI'm lost on what to do next in my career and I'm hoping people with similar histories or people who have broke out of web design can highlight some pathways I'm not finding on google. \n\nI am a Sr. Web Designer with a decade of professional experience as a web designer or developer. I have been coding HTML & CSS since the MySpace days (early 2000s) and have a degree in Media Arts with a concentration in Web & Interaction Design (what they called it before UI/UX was a thing). \n\nCurrently I work in quasi-government position as a Sr Web Designer. I create new pages in a CMS with a design system that was established before I arrived. I do *zero* design on the daily outside of the occasional new page. I sometimes help out by creating social media graphics. Most of my job is handling the relationship with our development vendor and maintaining content, reporting content, light QA, etc. My beef with my current situation is that I am more of a content editor and project manager than I am a designer. I am ultimately okay with this as I am pretty burnt out on designing in general. I'm burnt out on my role and after the latest review I am sure there is no upward movement. \n\nIn the past I have worked in eCommerce for a regional grocery store, insurance company, and national sports equpiment chain. \n\nI am at constant war with myself because I am both very creative and very analytical. I am burnt out on being creative unless the environment is very collaborative and engaging. I can no longer be in a silo. I like being data and task driven. \n\nAny tips on where to go from here? ",

I think that last part is critical; it's not about trying to work others harder, it's about figuring out what their strengths/weaknesses are and then building their confidence, which may play well to your analytical side.\n\nAs someone else said, going the self-employed route can also be very fulfilling since you \"become your own boss\" (with a big asterisk since you often end up working much longer hours and for clients still).",

In terms of workforce planning and monitoring, Bridgit Bench was also better because it's more flexible and could accommodate different types of projects in terms of size and duration which is what was lacking from LaborChart since it's more geared towards smaller and short-term projects. Bridgit Bench's automation features also gave it a big advantage as it saved us time and significantly reduced the risk of errors from manual data input. Lastly, the fact that Bridgit Bench came with an open API made it a lot easier for us as it allowed seamless integration with other tools that we already have especially Procore which is also one of the most commonly used tools in the construction business.  \n\nHere's where you can [read more](https://www.bridgitsolutions.com/bridgit-bench-vs-laborchart-comparison) about Bridgit Bench as well as a comparison between it and LaborChart, their unique features as well as the pros and cons of both software programs.",

A redirect is when an HTTP client asks for a resource and the HTTP server tells it to go to a different URL. In your case an HTTP client is asking for a resource and your HTTP server is saying *“sure, here is what you asked for”* and giving them a page that contains a program that, if ran, changes the location. So as far as an HTTP client is concerned, it asked for a page and got it, no redirect.\n\nYour HTTP response needs to be a 3xx status code with a `Location` header pointing to the new URL. Any client-side scripting isn’t a redirect in the eyes of an HTTP client – it just asked for a page and got one.\n\n> The only thing I couldn't do was redirecting via the header because of boring php/server configuration issues that prevent that.\n\n> Am I the only one dealing with this?\n\nMostly, yeah, because everybody else uses proper redirects. If there are “boring configuration issues” stopping you from doing that, then solve those issues.\n\n> Should I put the www. version as canonical, which is basically the web equivalent of neon-yellow bike pants?\n\nWhat do you mean by “neon-yellow bike pants”?\n\nThe `www` option is slightly preferable for a variety of reasons relating to cookies, DNS, recognisability by non-technical people, etc. But you shouldn’t switch just because you don’t want to solve your boring configuration issues – you’ll still have duplicate content with no redirect. Just solve the real problem properly.",

Again, this is probably because the server has a weird configuration (it's a container, whatever that exactly is), where all calls go through something resembling a proxy; e.g., all ip addresses as seen by $\\_SERVER\\['REMOTE\\_ADDR'\\] are the same, and I need to use $\\_SERVER\\['HTTP\\_X\\_FORWARDED\\_FOR'\\] to see the real ones.

Sure there are website builder tools like Framer and Webflow, but they're clearly branded as website builders, and they have different UIs. While I haven't actually used them beyond glancing at them, They have you choose components corresponding to HTML elements, rather than shapes / objects like Figma does. Besides being more popular, Figma seems to have a much smaller learning curve and lots of collaboration features. There are many open source vector editing tools but none I found that are meant to be an alternative to Figma and with bidrectional HTML + CSS.\n\nOften the designs created in Figma are converted into websites, I don't know how useful this would be why not have designers and developers use whichever tools best suit them and work in the same file formats? A wonderful thing about HTML + CSS are declarative layouts and designs in plain text so you can use any text editor or an IDE for feature like a side by side text and visual preview. A designer could just use the visual editing tool, and if they need advanced properties or layout options which aren't supported by said editor, then they could open a CSS text window up and write the layout properties there. Figma doesn't have equivalents of every single CSS property and doesn't let you write them.\n\nAnother benefit is having the designs as files stored on your device, while many apps can do this, Figma is purely cloud-based. Storing designs as plain text allows for saving file history with VCS tools like Git, which has a whole bunch of different tools for comparing versions, tags + branching, and platforms like Github support pull requests (while Figma has these, again why not have designers and developers use the same systems?). A designer could then utilize GUI git tools plus GitHub to collaborate and make pull requests.\n\nI find it bonkers that some SWEs out there have spent countless man hours into writing web UIs for tools like Figma that don't have bidirectional HTML + CSS previews. The designs are in proprietary file formats (or whatever is stored in the cloud), and developing the web UIs involves implementing the objects of those designs with a bunch of, you guessed it: HTML & CSS.\n\nFor personal vector editing I get the feeling that I should just write HTML & CSS in Vim (Neovim), which lets me navigate to and edit far away words in a document with only a few keywords (much much faster than moving a mouse around like in Word or Google Docs), which would be more productive for me than using any of these vector editing tools.",

They are rendered differently, operated differently abd there is no 1-to-1 mapping between them.\n\n\nSmall example. If I copy styles for our button from figma, it will always be 2 pixels larger. Why? Because in HTML+CSS borders actually occupy space, while most designers use inset border in SVG which doesn't do that. Simple example, but already your idea falling apart. \n\n\nAnd further we go - worse it will become. HTML is rendered responsive by default using User Agent styles (with some limitations and exceptions). Usually, when developers struggle to make something responsive, it's either design is crap, or developer broke that inherent property. SVG is not responsive in any way. It is scalable, meaning you take your image and can resize it however you like, but it is still same image confined in same viewbox. \n\n\nThen we have such a wonderful capabilities in CSS that allow us not to bother with precise sizing of blocks. They will occupy as much space as needed, wrap on new line and so on (again, unless you break something with crappy CSS). Then there are variables, transforms, etc.\n\n\nAnd most importantly, HTML have structure. In vector editor, you can move whatever you have wherever without bothering with a structure. If you do that in HTML, you will get unusable crap.\n\n\n\nIt is way simpler to either write HTML and CSS by hand from scratch, or use some WYSIWYG/sitebuilder to get proper result, rather than trying to turn SVG into usable valid HTML that looks the same _and_ behave like all different images (for narrow vewport, slightly wider viewport, wide viewport, etc).\n\n\nEdit: fixed incorrect statement about relationship between xml and html",

        "author": "zacholas321",
        "id": "wgqewc",
        "selftext": ">*“I’m charging twice as much per hour as I did at my pre-freelancing job and I’m working all the time. How TF am I bringing home* ***so little*** *per month?”*\n\nIf you’ve ever had a thought like this, you may benefit from optimizing for your effective hourly rate.\n\nMy goal with this post is to give you a framework for…\n\n1. Understanding what effective hourly rate *is* and why it matters\n2. Determining your **current** effective hourly rate\n3. Setting good goals & making better business decisions moving forward based on this lens for looking at how you get paid\n\n## What is effective hourly rate?\n\nIn case you haven’t heard the term before, “effective hourly rate” essentially means…\n\n>How much you *actually* make per hour ***after*** factoring in all the crap you have to do as a freelancer but don’t get directly paid for.  \n**= EFFECTIVE HOURLY RATE**\n\nCrap like…\n\n* Replying to a million Upwork posts to get one client\n* Sending invoices\n* Chasing clients to get paid\n* Doing prospecting calls\n* Prepping your stuff for taxes\n* Replying to emails\n* Leveling up your skills to stay relevant in the marketplace\n* Working on internal processes & systems for your business\n* Working on your website / portfolio\n* Managing staff\n* Copying files to that new computer you just bought\n\n## BIG-ASS DISCLAIMER\n\nThe “optimization steps” I recommend at the end of this post are what I’d consider more of a “late-stage, cushy life freelancer technique.”\n\nThat is to say, most of us start our freelancing careers perpetually broke and stuck in the cycle of always needing the next client, just to get the bills paid.\n\nIf this is you, I get it. I’ve been there.\n\nIt takes a long time to break out of that.\n\nAnd it f\\*cking sucks when you feel like you’re stuck there.\n\nBut if you stick with this freelancing thing long enough, always aiming to produce your best possible work, and trying to improve your skills with each new project…\n\nYou **will** break out of the cycle eventually.\n\nBut for today, that doesn’t change the fact that you’re stuck in it *right now*.\n\nSo when I talk in a bit about “optimization steps,” turning away certain types of work, etc. please remember to contextualize it for your situation and make the best decision for your current stage of business.\n\nMaybe you really *can’t afford* to turn away ***any*** business right now, regardless of how shitty the effective hourly rate is for it.\n\nIf that’s the case, no worries.\n\nKnowing where your time’s going and what work is most/least valuable will still helpful data for you to have.\n\nAccept that this is where you’re at *for now*, and perhaps put it on your mental list to kill that shitty low-effective-hourly-rate work as soon as you can afford to do so.\n\n## When effective hourly rate matters\n\nFor newbie freelancers / currently-employed peeps who see what the contractors at their company get paid, it can be easy to go like this when they see the hourly rates: 📷\n\n*(That’s meant to be a “envious eyes” emoji)*\n\nBut they don’t consider that it’s often the case that freelancers **only bill for about 1/3rd of the time their business takes them to run.**\n\nThis is why an often-recommended multiple when setting a freelance hourly rate is to **3x your job’s per-hour rate**.\n\nNone of this is ground-breaking, and I’ve seen it in about a million posts on Reddit and Quora.\n\nWhat I *really* want to talk about is…\n\n## *WHY* it matters\n\nEvery freelancer that’s ever existed wants to raise their rates.\n\nIt’s straightforward enough… More $ per hour = more $ in pocket. Sorted.\n\nBut I’d argue that it’s ***more important*** (or at least ***as*** important) to target improving your **effective** hourly rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause your life is finite, and chances are you’re doing a lot of stuff in your freelance business that you’d rather not.\n\nIf you can find optimizations that free up significant amounts of your time at little or no financial cost, you essentially get more life for free.\n\nBut optimizing for effective hourly rate can sometimes be somewhat sneaky and require more digging.\n\nLet’s look at an example.\n\nWhich of the following scenarios sounds better to you?\n\n### Scenario 1:\n\n* 12 separate projects this year, one per month\n* Each one will take \\~ 60 hours\n* Each one pays $6,000 (aka $100/hr)\n\n### Scenario 2:\n\n* 1 ongoing project contract for the whole year\n* Requires 60 hours time commitment per month\n* Pays $5,000 per month (aka $83.33/hr)\n\n### Which one’s better?\n\nWe’ll take a look SOLELY from an “effective hourly rate perspective.”\n\n*(Note that this example scenario is overly-simplistic and doesn’t factor in lifestyle preferences, working styles, etc.)*\n\nLet’s say you track all your time (exercise coming up) and any project you take on involves these “fixed time costs” for client acquisition:\n\n* 20 hours — Submitting Upwork proposals\n* 7 hours — Calls with prospective clients\n* 3 hours — Onboarding the new client, determining project scope, invoicing them, etc.\n\nThat 30 hours *has to happen* for every project, no matter the size.\n\nWhat this means is that in our “12 projects per year” example, we have a “fixed time cost” of 360 hrs/year (30 per project \\* 12 projects).\n\nWhereas the ongoing project has just the initial 30 hours.\n\nSpeaking *solely in terms of fixed time costs for client acquisition,* here’s how the total time commitment looks:\n\n### Scenario 1:\n\n* 12 separate projects this year, one per month\n* Each one will take \\~ 60 hours\n* Total gross paid for the year: $72,000 ($6k \\* 12)\n* Total time spent on the actual work over the year: 720 hrs (60 \\* 12)\n* Fixed client acquisition time costs for the year: 360 hrs (30 \\* 12)\n* **Total hours**: 1,080\n* **Effective hourly rate**: $66.67/hr\n\n### Scenario 2:\n\n* 1 ongoing project contract for the whole year\n* Requires 60 hours time commitment per month\n* Pays $60,000 per year ($5k \\* 12)\n* Total time spent on the actual work over the year: 720 hrs (60 \\* 12)\n* Fixed client acquisition time costs for the year: 30 hrs (30 \\* **1**)\n* **Total hours**: 750 hrs\n* **Effective hourly rate:** $80/hr\n\nSo even though from the outset, the first scenario appeared to pay better, when factoring in the effective hourly rate, the second scenario pays better.\n\n### Considerations & disclaimers\n\n>*“ZaCh, YoU’rE sO sTuPiD! What about if the client’s a pain and time consuming for the second project, or the multiple projects don’t take so much time to acquire, or \\[…\\]”*  \n**— UPSET READER**\n\nBefore you behead me, remember I disclaimed this was an overly-simplistic example.\n\nMy goal here isn’t to give you a guide on whether “more or less projects is better.”\n\nThat’s a whole can of worms and depends largely on what goals you’re most trying to target.\n\n(More money, more time, more freedom, less stress, etc.)\n\n## My goal here for you: A new lens for decision-making\n\nWith an eye on your effective hourly rate, you can make better decisions about what the ***true cost*** is to you to take on a project.\n\nSome examples…\n\n👉 If **every new client you work with** takes 3 unpaid hours to onboard, work with, etc., what would you need to charge for a *2-hours-worked project* to be worth it?\n\n👉 If a **certain type of work** requires 3x more un-billed communication time and only pays slightly better than a different type of work, *is it still worth pursuing?*\n\n👉 If you **really hate prospecting** and you can either burn 6 hrs per client or spend a couple hundred dollars per client acquired via paid ads linking to blog posts you wrote, which is better?\n\n👉 Finally feeling comfortable firing or charging more to that **super high-maintenance client** that takes unfair advantage of your time, after calculating how much per hour you’re actually making from their work.\n\n## Action steps:\n\nIf you want to calculate your effective hourly rate and optimize your business, here are the steps that have worked well for me…\n\n### ⏳ 1. Track ALL of your time & calculate your EHR\n\n**HOW:** You can track however you want; on paper, with a time tracking app, whatever.\n\n**HOW LONG:** Depending on your project pacing and schedule, it’s up to you how long it makes sense do this “track all your time” experiment for.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, **tracking all of your time for one month** is probably a good place to start.\n\nThe **most important thing** is that you categorize it appropriately into useful “buckets.”\n\n*(It’s going to be a bit of a pain to track all this if you’re not used to it, and it would suck if you had too few clearly-defined categories and missed out on some useful data.)*\n\nHere are some ideas; feel free to pick and choose what makes sense for your biz and add your own:\n\n* **Billable work** — Time you spend directly working on a project. I also like to sometimes break this down into subtypes to see where my hours go. (As a designer+dev, I might do “initial design,” “design revisions,” “coding,” “bug squashing,” “testing,” etc.)\n* **Prospecting – Outreach** — This would include cold email, Upwork proposals, etc.\n* **Prospecting – Sales calls** — I like to track this independently from the outreach time.\n* **Marketing** — If you do content marketing, I recommend breaking down into subtypes like writing, editing, etc.\n* **Existing client management / project management** — Talking/chatting with clients to keep projects moving along.\n* **Employee / contractor management** — All the time you spend managing your staff.\n* **Financial / Legal** — Doing your bookkeeping, etc.\n* **Administrative** — Answering random emails and whatnot. Sort of a generic catch-all.\n* **Misc** — The O.G. generic catch-all.\n\nNote that if you’re a toggl user like me, I **DO NOT** recommend using tags for these buckets, because you can’t generate pretty pie chart reports broken down by tag. (I learned this the hard way)\n\nInstead, for toggl users, I recommend that you create a new **client** for *yourself*, and then new **projects** for each of these “buckets” that belong to that client.\n\nI like to preface each of the project names with “ZS – ” (my initials) to group them and make them easier to pull up amidst all the client projects in there.\n\nExample setups of mine you can look at for reference:\n\n* [Here’s](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Toggl_EHR_Export.png) how I set up the buckets for my blog (client and project style)\n* [Here’s](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Toggl_EHR_Tags.png) how I set up the buckets for my web design freelancing (tag style; do not replicate)\n   * This was before I learned the hard way about tags — Your setup should structurally look more like [the one I did for my blog](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Toggl_EHR_Export.png) if you’re using toggl.\n\n### 📄 2. Make a list of your core values, along with work goals, likes, & dislikes\n\nDraw lines on a piece of paper to divide it into 4 quadrants. (Or print and [fill out this worksheet](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Optimizing-Your-Business-Based-on-Where-your-Time-Goes.pdf) I made)\n\n#### QUADRANT 1: CORE VALUES\n\nWhat are the **fundamental** things you value that your goals are oriented around?\n\nThese would be zoomed-out things like freedom, comfort, security, etc.\n\n#### QUADRANT 2: GOALS\n\nSpecific long-term goals with your business.\n\nThings like scaling it to be huge, or getting paid a lot and working part time to leave more time for underwater basket weaving, etc.\n\nDetermine if it’s more important for you to make as much money as possible, or re-claim as much time & freedom as possible.\n\nIf you value time & freedom more than money, I’d challenge you to do some budgeting and reflecting on your cost of living to determine your **target annual income**.\n\n(For me personally, as an expat living in a low-cost-of-living country with no kids, I target around $60-80k for my cost of living, savings, and investment goals. My #1 priority is time freedom, so having that $60k number in mind helps me decide what client work to take on vs. skip.)\n\n#### QUADRANT 3: WORK LIKES\n\nWhat are the specific tasks you most enjoy in your day-to-day work?\n\nFor me it’s the *actual deep work* like coding new features, designing, etc.\n\n#### QUADRANT 4: WORK DISLIKES\n\nWhat are the things you’d love to never do again if it were magically possible?\n\nFor me, it’d be prospecting, sales calls, bug squashing, billing, and convincing clients that my designs don’t actually *need* to go through another round of revision. 📷\n\n### 🔧 3. Optimize\n\nOnce you’ve tracked all your time for long enough and have lots of juicy data, it’s time to review that data alongside your lists from step 2.\n\nHow much of your time is un-billable and goes toward aspects of the job you don’t like?\n\nIs there a way that you can apply some creativity to your situation to minimize how much time you spend there?\n\nAre there certain types of projects you should or shouldn’t keep taking on?\n\nCertain structures in your business setup that should be changed?\n\nGoing through this exercise repeatedly over the years has been really valuable for me and has resulted in some dramatic changes in my business structure.\n\nA few changes I’ve made / wins I’ve personally had over the years as a result of this style of optimization (maybe they’ll give you some ideas)…\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n#### NO LONGER DOING SALES CALLS\n\nYoung Zach used to spend *hooooouuuuurrrsss* on sales calls trying to convince people that…\n\n1. Websites are good things to have, in general\n2. You should have me make yours\n3. You should pay me more than a pittance to do it\n\nThese days, I only jump on the phone once someone’s already seen a price estimate via email AND expressed interest in paying the amount quoted.\n\nThis means that by the time I jump on the phone with someone, they’re already pretty dang sure they want to work with me.\n\nMy conversion rate for “sales calls” (if you can call them that) at this point is upwards of 90%.\n\nDo I lose some business by quoting my price via email?\n\nYes, I’m sure of it.\n\nBut do I loathe spending 90 minutes on a Thursday night talking to someone who doesn’t convert simply because my services are out of budget?\n\nYou betcha; I loathe the shit out of it.\n\n**Quadrant Motivations:** 4\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n#### DOWN-SCALING MY AGENCY\n\nAfter evaluating how much time I was spending on project management and staff management – two of my least favorite types of work, btw – I made the decision to scale down my agency.\n\nI chose to go from a 3-person agency grossing in the $100-200k area to a solo-freelancer earning around $60-80k.\n\nCould I have maybe made it work it eventually and grown it to a multi-million-a-year agency?\n\nSure, maybe.\n\nBut yaknow what, I really just don’t like managing people.\n\nMost of the time, it seems like if you want a $1m digital agency, you need to employ like 30 or 40 people.\n\nWhereas there are plenty of entrepreneurs who run $1m product businesses with just themselves and a couple VAs. (I’ve worked with a few of them as their designer+dev)\n\n*I’ll take that one, please!*\n\nI decided I’d rather optimize for time freedom so that I can try to grow a product business, rather than try to grow a business reliant on managing a bunch of humans, which I really don’t enjoy.\n\n**Quadrant motivations:** 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n#### TURNING AWAY MOST CLIENTS\n\nEarlier this year, I went from working with a client every few months to doing ongoing work with one client.\n\nIt was a similar move to the agency down-scaling — another tweak to minimize un-billed prospecting time and onboarding time.\n\nBy working with this one client and doing little updates for past clients every so often, I can earn my same targeted \\~$60k a year working an average of 10 or so hours a week.\n\nThe client’s happy because it’s cheaper than hiring me at my regular rates for all that time spent, and I’m happy because I don’t have to do much outside of the work itself.\n\n**Quadrant motivations:** 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n## HBU?\n\nGo forth! Track! Tweak! Come back and tell me if you spot any cool optimizations or have any successes (or challenges) raising your effective hourly rate.\n\nDo you already have experience optimizing based on your effective hourly rate? How'd it go? What did you do to improve it? Anything I missed? Think I'm full of shit? Let me know!",

I did the website for a large company that’s almost like the “BBB for financial advisors.”  \nSimilar story to the first one: whenever a new advisor wants to strike out on their own, they learn pretty quick that they need a website. Who to hire?  \n“Oh, maybe the guy who made the website for that org that I just paid thousands of dollars to to tell me how to start my advisor business.”  \n👉 The takeaway here: both of my big “lucky referral breaks” came from getting an in with figureheads that others looked to when trying to get started.  \n😭 Where it’s challenging: It’s not always effective to reach out directly.  \nIn probably, idk, like 2012, I cold-emailed a big internet marketer dude who also lived in Colorado trying to hire him as a mentor and do some website work for him pro bono to get my foot in the door.  \n… Which I managed to secure.  \nI think he actually booked me for paid work eventually too. (But it was low-paying)  \nThe problem though, is that I was always working from that starting point of “working for free” and I don’t know of a really good way to start pro-bono for someone but have them want to pay top-dollar later.  \nIn hindsight, he also wasn’t a great fit because he was really active in the social media space. Social media marketing + telling people to use leadpages = no tie-in to need a site.  \nThe commonality with my two lucky breaks was that a core part of the recommendations they gave to their followers was “get a website,” and that they came as a result of a random related connection.  \n(For the big advisor org, I was referred to them by a client who helped advisors set up sites and often subcontracted dev work to me, and she was friends with the founder)  \nMy recommendation here for idea #4 stems from this one working so well, while attempting to address the challenge of the “cold outreach pro bono” thing.  \nIf you can create thought leadership content for a big thought leader that your niche clients look to for advice, it gives you all that borrowed credibility AND a foot in the door to later approach that thought leader with a partnership deal, i.e.  \n“Hey Blogowner, seems like people are really digging that article I wrote for you. I was thinking it’d be cool for us to launch a service together where we help people set up their first sites; happy to send you a kickback of $200 for each client you refer or white label it under your brand blahblahblah”",

They win cuz they get good content; you win cuz you get some leads.  \nEven though prob initially uncomfy for most freelancers, If you can do thought leadership content within a niche you often serve, you stand to get really great leads because by the time they come to your site, they already trust you and see you as an expert.  \nFor example, one of the niches I often serve is financial advisors.  \nIt was never an intentional decision; I just worked with some leaders in the space and consequently got a lot of referrals and kinda became the “advisor website guy.”  \nIf I wanted to really lean into this, what I would do is find some sites that advisors are reading and aim to do posts on there that would appeal to people who’d be good leads for me.

Here's the intended functionality:\n\n    Form Page 1: Enter Financial Details\n    Form Page 2: Enter Contact Information\n        *API CALL #1*\n    Form Page 3: Verify the information we have is correct (from API response)\n        *API CALL #2*\n    Form Page 4: Full quote with add-ons, total price, and the option for paying a deposit\n\nOur website is built on WordPress and all of our other forms are built using Formidable. We're on the basic plan, but I do see that there is a native API integration when upgrading to the business plan. However, I'd like to make a call mid-way through the form and update HTML within the form dynamically - I'm not sure if that's natively supported (though I suppose I could do it with JavaScript). Also I've been struggling to identify if Formidable natively supports a loading animation between pages.\n\nI'm interested to know if Formidable or another form builder would natively support the full functionality of the form web app I'm trying to build before I go about building something fully bespoke.",

My project aims to strike a balance between effective ad placement and non-intrusive user experience while tackling the risks of malicious ads (malvertising). Your valuable insights can help shape this work!\n\n1️⃣ Your Experience with Wordpress or any CMS Ad-Management Plug-ins\n\nWhat are your thoughts on commonly used ad-management tools like Google Adsense, Advanced Ads, WP QUADS, or similar? Specifically:\n\n* How well do they perform in placing ads without disrupting user experience?\n* Are there areas where they excel or fall short in maintaining smooth user interactions?\n\n2️⃣ Security in Ad Management\n\nAs part of this project, I’m also exploring ways to improve security, especially against malvertising.\n\n* What tools or plug-ins do you currently use to secure your site against malicious ads or common web threats?\n* What features or functionalities would you like to see in a plug-in designed to mitigate malvertising and enhance security?\n\nThis is for research purposes as I am currently working on designing a new plug-in with a focus on UI/UX and security features. I’d greatly appreciate your inputs to better understand user needs and the current challenges faced by site administrators.",

        "author": "Bananas8ThePyjamas",
        "id": "n693wi",
        "selftext": "### Hey👋\n\nI’ve been using apps to boost my productivity for a while. For the past 3 years to be exact. This is the reason I’ve decided to share the ones that have broken into my daily routine and that will probably help you too. I know there are millions of apps that are supposed to increase your productivity and to be honest, I’ve tried a lot of them. After filtering if this app is useful enough, I have come to the 7 apps I cannot live without. I hope this saves you some time from researching everything!\n\n### 7. [Slack](http://slack.com/)\n\nIt’s not what you think! It’s actually not. I don’t use Slack to communicate with anyone. I am in some groups but that’s not the point. The point is that I use Slack to take quick notes. How? I make up new channels for each one of my projects and whenever I want to remember something related to a project I send it as a message. You’re probably wondering, why don’t you use some kind of fancy note-taking app, like Roam or Drafts. That’s because I find most note-taking apps cluttered, and not to the point, and others very simple for my liking.\n\n### 6. [Forest](http://forestapp.cc/)\n\nThis one is pretty obvious. I think. Pomodoro is one of the few scientifically proven methods to be more productive. For those not familiar with Forest, it is basically a fancy timer. You can set a work timer and a break timer. I usually do 40 minutes of work with 5 minutes of break. This can help you feel like you have something to anticipate. You can say to yourself “It’s just 24 more minutes of work. That’s not that much” and continue to be productive.\n\n### 5. [Newsify](http://newsify.co/)\n\nNext on the list is Newsify. You may not know what Newsify is, so let me explain. Newsify is an RSS reader, it basically gathers all the articles and blog posts from people you follow and displays them to you. This helps me keep up with the blogs that I want to follow, without having to look up every single one. I used to use Feedly, but I prefer the interface of Newsify 100x times more.\n\n### 4. [Mist](http://usemist.com/)\n\nIn short, Mist is a Chrome Extension that helps you practice mindfulness without fully detaching from your work. Every few hours, I will do a simple Body Scan Meditation, because I have found that I am more productive that way. I prefer Mist rather than all the other mindfulness apps because it is built into Google Chrome. I got access to it a couple of weeks ago because they currently have a waitlist, but it's a tool that I use every day.\n\n### 3. [Asana](http://asana.com/)\n\nAsana is my one-stop project manager. I use it to do everything from tracking progress on projects to writing down deadlines. I discovered this software about 3 months ago and it has really changed y workflow. You can organize your projects in a calendar or tasks view, but I personally use the calendar for almost everything. It is very easy to plan out what you have to do on a day-to-day basis for every project.\n\n### 2. [Superhuman](http://superhuman.com/)\n\nSuperhuman is one of those apps where you don’t think it’s that useful at first, but you can’t live without it. Simply, it is a fancy email app. They claim to help you get through your emails in 2x the time, and I find that to be true. They also helped me declutter and organize my inbox which is a big thing if you take into account my 21.000 unread emails. Yes. 21.000. After all that, I am proud to announce that I’ve hit the fabled Inbox Zero.\n\n### 1. [Notion](http://notion.so/)\n\nHave you ever googled anything related to productivity? Then you have probably come across Notion. Notion is an amazing note-taking app in which you can organize… your whole life. I use Notion to keep track of my Reading List. I write down every book I get recommended and when I have time, I listen to them on Audible. I also have my goals and weird trips I want to do in there.

I use them to plan and do my work. I also go for lots of walks and go jogging and cycling. Work will get done when it gets done. If I had some timer going off every 45 minutes I would throw whatever device it was running on out the window, immediately boosting my productivity. \n\nSide note - Productivity culture is marketing pseudo- science that makes people feel \"productive\" because it gets them thinking about \"productivity\". We are human beings, not robots, and we should not judge ourselves our others by our \"productive output\". Furthermore, no app or technique is \"scientifically proven\" to make anyone more productive. Because there is no agreed upon definition of productivity nor is there an agreed upon metric with which to measure it. If someone were to say standing on your head for ten minutes a day boosts productivity by 20%, how would you go about disproving that? It's an unfalsifiable claim. Productivity \"science\" was invented to sell books. If it works for you great, but don't fall for marketing.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys-\n\nWhen designing a Hero for a new webpage- a Homepage for example. How is the image for the Hero feature supposed to scale with the various screen sizes?\n\nIs it supposed to shrink/expand with the window, or auto-resize with the window. Ie; for example I'm designing for a PC screen (various sizes), Tablet, and Mobile.\n\nAre these three separate image designs for the Hero, which all load differently depending on the device?\n\nI understand scaling the image from a browser, which shrinks with the window movement (mostly). But am I just adding the device to the Div when implementing?\n\nI apologize if this is a stupid question. I just want my hero image to scale properly, and it either gets cut-off when the window shrinks, or looks messed up on smaller devices. Any insight would be appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: After review, the easiest way to optimize images, and content in general, is to use a CDN (content delivery network). I'm sure something similar can be accomplished directly within the codebase, as many external libraries are, however- I'm seeing many advantages to researching and finding the right external library for your needs. Here's the latest snippet from my project notes.   \n\n\n**I think we're on the right track optimizing images and hosting content using the Cloudinary library. I like that they handle the respsonsiveness of the images, and they have AI for things like generating image tags, optimizing size/ scale/ etc. They also have compatibility for video, and various other content strategies. Using a CDN (content delivery network) alleviates the responsibility of having to manage this content from within the codebase itself. While it is another library to learn, we can soft-launch using Cloudinary and gradually expand on how we're using this platform to optimimze performance. Additionally, we can continue our research and evaluation of CDN's in general, ie; bunnyCDN which seems to be growing in popularity, and whereas pricing will become an important factor as content on our website continues to grow.** ",

You can figure that out by asking them questions like -\n\n- Why did you choose this profession over anything else?\n- Is it just for the money or you have passion for the business?\n- Where are you seeing yourself in the next 5 years?\n- How can you help in removing poverty from the world ?\n- Are you associated with any Charity for helping the needy?\n\nI mean anything that tells you about how this person is from the inside out and trust me, if you can find a reliable, honest and trustworthy Developer to work with you, you will not be looking back ever. He will value your time, efforts and money altogether and give you more than what you expect from him. Being a Developer myself, I have learnt this from my previous clients that I have worked with. Some of them are award winning business owners as well, who ran BIG Steel Companies in the past.\n\nP.S If you are still looking for a Website Developer, please let me know as I am available to take up some new projects.

Maybe there's additional padding. Maybe there's a margin issue. Just move up the hierarchy of elements and you'll figure it out.\n\nTwo: bootstrap is basically container > row > columns. The container will center the content on the page, the row will set your basic view, and the columns hold your content. I typically build my pages with multiple containers so that I can apply full page backgrounds. You probably don't need that here but experiment.\n\nAnd finally: get familiar with all the different bootstrap components. It also helps to inspect the code on their examples to see how they built it.\n\nGood luck!",

They also will send requests for reviews when the job is done (in their case, house cleaning jobs). \n\nI played around a little bit with NiceJob and placed the widget code on my site... and while it was ok during the free trial, after 14 days I got this notice that I need to upgrade my package to $75/mo. \n\nSure, there's some other things that NiceJob offers but I'm only interested in gathering those reviews and requesting new ones from clients once I have their website or social media management done. Maybe I'm a cheap bastid, but $75/mo is a lot. \n\nHas anyone used something like NiceJob but with a Nice Price? \n\nBonus points for being bootstrap 5.x friendly and doesn't require WordPress or anything like that.\n\nMahalo!\n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "Sometimes you have a large css file for your home page depending on the size of the project, and it turns out it ends up render blocking the page.  So to combat this, I found a code snippet to defer loading of your css files here:\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/path/to/my.css\" media=\"print\" onload=\"this.media='all'; this.onload=null;\">\n\nWhat you do, is take the code that you need for your landing page section above the fold, copy and paste it into a separate css file and call it critical.css (you can use whatever you want, that's what I chose). Then remove that css from the main style.css or whatever it's named.  Add that critical.css to your head, and add the file path of your main css sheet in place of the href in the code I have above, and delete the link tag that contains the original style.css\n\nSo instead of your link tags looking like this\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/style.css\">\n\nIt will look like this\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/critical.css\">  \n <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/style.css\" media=\"print\" onload=\"this.media='all'; this.onload=null;\">\n\nBy removing only the parts you need to load the styles above the fold (meaning everything that is on the screen when the site loads), and placing them in their own css file to load, and defer loading the css for the rest of the page until the page loads, you are fixing your css sheet from render blocking the page load. You're only loading what you NEED to load, and deferring the rest.  \n\nYou can do this for external libraries too.  Like I use the Animate on Scroll library to make on scroll animations, but its css cdn is also a render blocking resource, so I place that in the defer link and it still works normally without render blocking the page. Like so:\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.css\" media=\"print\" onload=\"this.media='all'; this.onload=null;\">\n\nThis a a great trick to help push the limits of your load times. Doing this got me from a 98-99 to a nice 100 more consistently on larger sites.  I've tried this out of a few of my sites already and it boosted all their page speed scores to 99-100's. Hope this helps!  Thought I'd share what I found.",

It can match CSS classes in HTML, Vue, React, PHP, HAML, JS… anything. \n\nThe way I use PurgeCSS to make a critical style sheet is by telling it to look at templates at the top of the app. Like: header.html, nav.html, breadcrumb.html & hero.html.

We're looking for a designer who can look at the issue from both an artistic and technical perspective, **not a coder**.

We'll build whatever the final design is on our own systems, which might be a rebuild of the current system or something completely new to us - so the frontend/backend system is irrelevant at this point. \n\nI'm an admin and am familiar with the B2B/B2C concepts, but it is difficult to describe the role of our website. The explanation I usually use is  : \n>We are a theoretical automobile manufacturer named \"Ford\" and we want to sell our cars and trucks. We don't really sell directly to the end customer, we sell through local car dealerships and other intermediaries. But, we still need to market to the end customer as well as the dealers and intermediaries.  \n>\n>We have a few different 'profiles' we use for our product pages. One for passenger cars, one for sports cars, one for passenger trucks, one commercial trucks. They are all similar but have a few differences. Our product pages pull info from our API and display it according to the profile design. \n*(We do not manufacture or sell cars and definitely are not Ford. This was just used as an example. Please don't sue us)*\n\nWhat we are looking for is a new profile design. We want the design to be backed up by rationale other than SEO although that needs to be a part of it, of course. The ultimate goal is sales, but the focus is not on closing the sale or eCommerce. Get the customer's attention, help the salespeople quickly find information they need to close a sale, provide detailed specification without drowning the casual visitor in technical information.\n\nThe designs we have previously used have all been created by graphic designers who focused on print material, marketers focused on SEO, or an internal team who essentially cloned a common design used by competitors. We might end up doing the same thing again, but we've reached a point where it makes sense to at least try to do something unique and different. Before we go crazy and throw all the crazy designs we can find on Dribble or Codepen on the page, we thought it would be a good idea to hire someone who knows what they are doing to help us come up with a good design.\n\nThanks for your input by the way.",

        "author": "chriskok1337",
        "id": "jhtxg3",
        "selftext": "TL;DR - We want to help people learn ML/UI/UX/WebDev by building an impactful side-project together. We intend to personally call each team on a weekly basis to discuss progress and next steps. It’s all free and you keep everything you make. Fill out the form below if you’re interested! For those who prefer video: [https://youtu.be/pZQcJufsTkA](https://youtu.be/pZQcJufsTkA) \n\n## Introduction\n\nFirst, a short update to [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/geuukb/want\\_to\\_learn\\_ml\\_by\\_applying\\_it\\_to\\_games\\_ill/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/geuukb/want_to_learn_ml_by_applying_it_to_games_ill/) . In essence, we’ve done this before with 5 individuals who were the first Chronic Coder Academy (CCA) Fellows. We called them for 30 minutes each week to go over the details and action items for their side-projects. We started in June 2020 and just wrapped up their awesome applied ML projects a month or two ago. They’re amazing in their own right so I won’t take any credit for their success but since June, 3 of them have new jobs, 1 just started college and is working with an ML professor and the last is working on finding a job outside his home country (so his goals are more long term but we’re actually working on a different project together now).\n\nOur focus then was strictly on Machine Learning projects applied to games. The projects were done solo and the fellows mainly focused on building their ML skills. However, we’ve learnt that there is a ton of value in working as a team and also a lot of opportunity in the program for people with different skill sets to learn from too. Hence, we’re reaching out to this subreddit along with other related web development and machine learning subs to gather a better team composition this time around. I’ll expand on all this soon.\n\n## Who\n\nI’m Christopher Kok, a research software engineer at a large aerospace company focused on applying Machine Learning to various problems within aerospace. At work, I also run the ML/AI community of practice (leading some of the most attended events company-wide that focus primarily on fostering a better understanding of ML). In my free time, run a Youtube Channel (called Chronic Coder) that focuses on applied ML advice. I also cover a lot of my own fun side-projects to do with applying ML to online games.\n\nJoining me is my friend, Ignacio (Nacho) Raposo. He has nearly half a decade’s worth of applied ML experience and is the former COO of an AI consulting firm (Lugus-Intelligence) that focuses on projects solving problems in mainly industrial domains (from industrial mining to internet of things). His main role there is client/project management and strategy, but I’d say he’s one of the best people I know when it comes to understanding state of the art ML research and applying that to whatever problem it is that needs solving. \\[[https://lugus-intelligence.com/english\\_team.html](https://lugus-intelligence.com/english_team.html)\\]\n\nWe both specialize more in the ML sphere, as you can tell, but we both have worked with other professionals in web development and user experience while having done some ourselves too. We hope to bring that to the table. Honestly, beyond that, we hope the program will help build the skills you seek while working together regardless of our guidance.\n\n## What\n\nIn short, we want to pull people together and create 2-5 teams that will develop their own ML based side-projects while we supervise and call each week to discuss action items. Although the app itself will be ML based, there’s a lot to do and gain from the web dev and UX side of things too. Also, the theme will no longer just be game based, we’d love to hear what problems you’d love to solve in general! The more real-world the problem is, the better.\n\nThis time round, I want to try implementing some stricter guidelines. The primary focus is still on learning through developing whatever we can. However, we’ve learnt that we could do better with some set deadlines and goals to hit. I’ve recently written out some guidelines here for a proposed process based on our past experience and a few books on ML apps and project management that I’ve read: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-M6nxeLnIaFufS-u2Ymp45AYB9eEmVHZno7G2F545U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-M6nxeLnIaFufS-u2Ymp45AYB9eEmVHZno7G2F545U/edit?usp=sharing). If you prefer a video format: [https://youtu.be/Vsef5E4hzYw](https://youtu.be/Vsef5E4hzYw). \n\nLike I mentioned, we’re mainly focused on ML and PM there too. Hopefully by working with more and more people with diverse skill sets we can build up a guideline that outlines useful steps for Web Developers and UI/UX folks too. It’s rough and still open to change, so let me know if you have specific comments or concerns. To be honest, I’m sure it will change anyway throughout the course of this next phase.\n\nSome high-level details:\n\n* Teams of 1 Designer and 2 programmers (one ML and one Web Dev)\n* Overarching goal is to ship in 6 weeks (more information on tasks each week defined in the doc/video above) \n* Quick team meeting each week to go over progress, discuss issues, and plan next steps\n\n## How \n\nYou can sign up here: [https://forms.gle/jLtqCbLCJnsChKJe6](https://forms.gle/jLtqCbLCJnsChKJe6) \n\nWe will begin the selection process shortly (last time it took us about a week). What I said in my previous post stands true (with some minor modifications to include UX/webdev folk):\n\n“This is targeted at people who care about making something impactful and also want to learn more through application. Your age, race, gender, ethnicity, etc mean nothing to me but you have to be passionate about what you do and hopefully converse well enough in English. Everything you make is completely your own, no matter how much advice or guidance we end up giving. Oh and also, it’s completely free (before anyone asks). I’m really in this to better expose myself to different applications and ideas plus I truly enjoy watching people learn; especially from interesting use cases.”\n\n## When \n\nMy goal is to start in the first week of November and end just before the Christmas season consumes our joyful souls.\n\n## Why\n\nTeaching through application has been one of my most fulfilling life goals and I hope I get to continue that here. However, since it’s on such short notice, I know that not everyone might have the time or opportunity to join us now and I also know that we may not be able to select every one of you to work with. Hence, if it doesn’t work out for you this time round, please feel free to join our discord. We’d love to see you connect with other professionals (potential teammates?) there and maybe build your own projects in your own time too!\n\nJoin the discord here:[ https://discord.gg/ZummSXK](https://discord.gg/ZummSXK)",

        "selftext": "# So the title seem slightly misleading.\n\nTo be clear, the job I am applying for is a Web Developer Intern. This position detailed that it expects the candidate to be enrolled in a Bootcamp or perusing a degree in Computer Science. I am currently learning through Codecademys career path ( full-stack engineer). They do not expect the candidate to feel comfortable with basics like html, CSS,  JavaScript, and PHP as they will be learning throughout the internship. This sounded like a perfect opportunity for me, mainly because I  have been practicing all of the above and would like some actual working experience.\n\nDuring my interview I explained that I have used all of the following and am growing comfortable, however I was pursuing the internship to build my skills and get some real working experience. They explained that the internship is 10 weeks and they usually look to move the candidate from internship into a position after they have completed the bootcamp or degree. (This all sounded great, if I could land this internship I could focus on what this company utilizes and grow my career with them over time)\n\nI got a call back and was offered a second interview. They asked when I would be done with this bootcamp ( I let them know a few weeks). They then offered me a second interview , but as a software engineer not an Intern. Based on our first interview they decided a better fit would be this route rather than the internship.\n\nI accepted the interview, and have dedicated these next few weeks to finishing my bootcamp + some interview prep. This is exciting however I feel vastly underprepared as I am still not as comfortable with other things like Databases or how to use react effectively.\n\n# My questions:\n\n* What do you think the purpose of skipping the internship altogether and considering me for a software engineer role?\n* Do I have a real chance to land this job?\n* Should I end the interview stating that the internship was what I initially wanted and would still like to be considered if not offered this role?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# A few extra details:\n\n* I sought out the Talent Acquisition Manager, and reached out directly. (They introduce their team on the website.)\n* During the zoom interview I had a great conversation, and expressed a lot of interest.\n* I did not embellish my skills, however I am afraid that saying I am growing comfortable was mistaken for I have great comfortability in the basics.\n* I have built a website for a family friend, this was initially created vanilla but updated to get practice on a few recourses. I did update page with Bootstrap (But only for framework practice, connected an API through Google Places for live reviews, and PHP for form submissions to an email.\n* Any additional portfolio pieces I have came with a great help from google.\n* At this time, I am not sure I will be able to quickly, or confidently answer any questions thrown at me without this help.\n* I am extremely passionate and self motivated.",

Apologies in advance as I'm not a web designer, but I'm currently working as part of a web redesign project and we're struggling to communicate with our dev about how the banner image in the header should behave when the page is scaled.\n\nThe website our graphic designer made is designed to have a banner image where the full **height** of the image is always visible, and any cropping happens on the left and right side equally.\n\nMeanwhile our dev keeps coding a page where the full **width** of the image is always visible. This means that cropping when scaling is happening at the top and bottom equally, which is what we don't want.\n\nNot sure I'm doing a great job of explaining this, so we can't seem to get it resolved.

The way the banner is set up, probably with a maximum height, it actually _does_ get \"wider\" than the images on really large/wide screens. To get around this you would have to base the height of the banner on the page width, to make sure the _aspect ratio_ of the banner is never wider than that of the image.\n\nYour images look to have a height equaling about 26 % of their width, so you could set the minimum height of the banner to be `26vw`, meaning 26 % of the page width. This would make the banner grow in height on very wide screens, to make sure that the images don't have to be cropped.",

Also, it seems like the sort of thing one couldn't do without some programming, although I suppose it's not impossible for a WordPress plugin to exist which handles this. However, here's what I think the approach would look like.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there are two parts to the problem: responding to updates to the spreadsheet, and working with the sheet data. The Google Sheets API supports downloading the content of a spreadsheet page. I've done this on static sites by getting an API key, sharing the page, and putting together a URL where the sheet data could be downloaded. Every time the static site rebuilds, it fetches the spreadsheet data and generates new content based off it. If hosted on Netlify and paired with Zapier, it could be used to trigger a site rebuild when the spreadsheet is updated. \n\nI don't have very much experience with WordPress, and even less with its internals, but I suspect there would be a similar flow of data and events when doing this: \n\n>Zapier detects spreadsheet update --> Zapier sends a request to the website to signal a change in content --> website fetches the spreadsheet data and updates things accordingly\n\n  \nOne possibility off the top of my head, though, is setting up a tiny static site which does this, hosting it off Netlify, and including it on the WordPress site inside an iframe.",

It seems like cruft and excessive boilerplate at first, but if your goal is to work in teams all this stuff saves time and headache in the long run. Keep researching what people think, here are my thoughts:\n\n* Leave jQuery completely in the rear view mirror. No one begins a new project with it these days\n* *If* you want to use something like Bootstrap, use Tailwind instead. You may not need either though\n* When choosing a frontend framework: for maximum hirability choose React and for maximum 'riding the future trend' choose Svelte. If you have reasons for Vue and Angular though, go for it— this choice isn't like getting a tattoo and swearing allegiance like many will have you believe\n* Every time you do a tutorial or two, make sure you practice it by building something little with what you learned. This avoids 'tutorial hell'. Then, pick a tutorial/course that's slightly outside your comfort zone. This is how you continually and rapidly grow\n* *If* you consider a bootcamp, look up individual reviews beforehand. I can say without exaggeration than more than half will not be worth your money",

I'd suggest making sure your view has word wrap turned on (alt+z).

It's too much and leads to too much backtracking figuring out when and who shared what. We need version control, so any tips on what works for your team's process would help. Thanks!",

I am creating a small company website and I have three main issues which I did not manage to solve and googling is not helping.\n\n1. For some reason I can't apply a black background color for the entire website, only some of the containers accept a background color, but <body> does not apply the color.\n2. I have created some slanted image boxes and they go over their own and the next <div> boxes. They also cover the text inside their own box.\n3. I am trying to create a floating text above a slideshow, but I found no way to make one, that does not swap with the pictures.\n\nAny kind of help would be appreciated!\n\nYou can find my html and everything else here [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QU1UdBea69ZlQOHdp0gNJo3oRXzt-UXO?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QU1UdBea69ZlQOHdp0gNJo3oRXzt-UXO?usp=sharing)",

                "body": "1. The background color does apply, but your .pusher has a white background, so you cant see it, because it's natural index is higher than the outer container. Also you have height 100% on your body, which I recommend removing at first.\n2. screwing images or divs is sometimes a bit tricky, because you have to position the elements properly. The main reason why the text is not visible is, because your images have position: absolute; what you want here is that the text is absolute and the image relative. Make sure you wrap the image and the text into a container which is relative. After that you can use something like: position: absolute; top: 50%; left:50%; transform: translate(-50%,-50%); to position the text in the center of the wrapping div.\n3. Do you mean, that the text does not slide? So it always stays fixed in the middle? If that's the case you need a container that is wrapping your swiper and have your text absolute above it, same as with the images in point 2\n\nQuick tip: if you use .ui.grid as your wrapping container always make sure to use . column inside otherwise you screw up your positioning. The column padding is kind of reverting the minus margins in .grid. (Don't want to go to deep on that, it has reasons) They only work together. If you do not want any column elements, just use another wrapper class.\n\nI hope that I was able to help you. Happy coding.  \n\n\nedit: typo",

The point of a font is that all the characters consistently look the same all the time, everywhere, so the font is not \"rendering differently\" on different OSes. That's just what it looks like. What's actually happening is the OS has substituted a different font because the original was not available to it.\n\nProbably what happened is you tried to view a document with a font on a machine that didn't have that font installed. This happens when you try to transfer MS Word or raw design files to different people. Even if the machines have the same OS, if their installed fonts are different, the OS will substitute a 'similar' font. Instead, you need to use export formats like .pdf, .png, .jpg, etc. rather than raw files like .docx, .ai, .psd etc.\n\nOn the web, it works the same. The web page determines the fonts via CSS. If a machine doesn't have the font, it substitutes another one according to the list the developer creates. That list is called a font stack, and it holds all the fonts in the order they should be tried. The last item on the list is a generic one and each OS has its own generic font for the different kinds (i.e. serif, sans, mono, etc.).\n\nGoogle fonts and custom fonts include the font files in the web package, so if users don't have it on their machines, it's still available to use and the fonts don't fallback to others in the stack. In this case, you either link to a place the fonts live on the web, or link to a place they live on your server. This will ensure that all users see the same font.\n\nBasically your boss has sent you on a wild goose chase because they don't understand how fonts work.\n\nIf the document is distributed in an export format, or the webpage is properly built, all users will see the same font regardless of what OS they use.",

        "selftext": "Hi! I've recently been designing an ecommerce site for a friend, and I want to create a system that can tag products by category. I'd also like to have a search-by-tags option on the website. For example, I'd like to categorise my products as shirts/pants etc; and display it next to the product picture. I also need to do without php, as the website will go on a server that won't supprot php.\n\nHowever, I can't find any answers by googling, as I usually do; largely because I'm not sure what to call this. Obviously, googling tags with html only returns me with websites teaching basic html tags. \n\nAny advice/website that might describe how to go about this? Thanks a bunch!!",

        "author": "ybouane",
        "id": "nn8rj1",
        "selftext": "Hey redditors,\n\nWhat is you stack? I think it would be nice to see what tools web designers are using in their workflow nowadays.\n\nI develop no-code websites and these are my go-to tools that I use almost everyday (non-exhaustive of course):\n\n# [Photopea](http://photopea.com/)\n\nPhotoshop for free and on the web. I'm actually subscribed to Photoshop CC but its super slow and laggy on my computer so I often end up opening a tab and just use photopea instead. A super handy tool especially if you ever want to quickly edit a picture and don't want to open Photoshop (and wait 1min for it to open).\n\n# [Sktch.io](http://sktch.io/)\n\nYou may have heard of Webflow and [Bubble.io](http://bubble.io/), I've been using them in the past, but recently started using [Sktch.io](http://sktch.io/) as my main website builder. The great thing about it is that in addition to the frontend features I was used to with Webflow/Bubble, it provides much more in terms of backend and frontend interactions. I can't count how many times, I would start a project with Webflow and end-up hiring a developer to add a simple feature. With sktch, I can develop those features with a modular/visual system directly in the editor.\n\n# [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)\n\nThese fonts are free for commercial use and they are web-ready. Many platforms support them natively, but whenever I am trying to find a font for a specific title or website I'm creating, I head to [fonts.google.com](http://fonts.google.com/), increase the font size and start filtering the fonts to find the perfect one for my use-case.You can also download the fonts in TTF formats (by going to the project's Github) if you want to use them locally in Photoshop/Illustrator for example.\n\n# [Flat ui colors](https://flatuicolors.com/)\n\nYou probably use a different palette tool, but this one is my personal favorite. A few colors available in a few \"styles\". Simple and effective. I hate going through color palette tools that overwhelm me with options.\n\n# [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)\n\nPage load speed is super important for SEO and for user-experience. Google PageSpeed Insights is a great tool for finding bottlenecks in your website, maybe an image you are using is too large and you could save a few KB by choosing a more appropriate size, or maybe your text doesn't have enough contrast which lowers it accessibility.PageSpeed is a great tool for detecting these common mistakes and thus improving UX.\n\n# [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com)\n\nMy mailing list service of choice. It's very easy to link Mailchimp with [Sktch.io](http://sktch.io/) and use tags when people subscribe to your website.Mailchimp also has great automation tools allowing you to create a cool onboarding experience for your users/subscribers.\n\n# [Zapier](https://zapier.com)\n\nTo be honest, I haven't use Zapier extensively so far, but it is an automation tool that you can use to run tasks. You can use Zapier to detect events happening in an app to trigger actions on a different app for example. Zapier is a great tool for linking different services together and build a \"backend\" for your website/service.\n\n# [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) / [Behance](https://behance.net)\n\nWhen doing creative work, it's of course important to find inspiration and these tools are great for that. In addition you can showcase your work there and build a portfolio which is great for getting clients!\n\n# [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)\n\nWhile Dribbble and Behance are great for getting inspiration in terms of design/ui/ux, ProductHunt is great for finding project ideas. It's also a great tool to see what ideas end up working (getting traction) and those that don't.\n\n# [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)\n\nA popular icon pack distributed as a font. Very handy as you don't have to juggle with hundreds of svg files (it helps with page loading as well to pack everything in a single file). Of course these icons are not the fanciest, they are single-tone (dual-tone is available for PRO users) so it's mostly useful for small icons used for ui stuff.\n\n# [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/)\n\nA huge collection of icons (free & premium) of various styles that will meet your needs. Attribution is required unless you subscribe to the premium version. Make sure to read their FAQ for knowing how you can use the icons.\n\nLet me know how that compares to your own stack!",

Nullam sollicitudin ornare sem, ac **mollis** sem tristique non. Pellentesque ut diam in **magna** efficitur pharetra viverra id justo. Duis eget **pretium** lorem. Maecenas congue nec elit ut blandit.\n\nLet's assume that the bold words are underlined words (I can't figure out how to underline in stackoverflow). The text is written by somebody else and it's not fixed, which means I can't actually tell them to add whenever they need something underlined (I can ask them to add the though).\n\nI ended up using this\n\n    u {     \n        text-decoration: none;     \n        background-image: linear-gradient(to right, white 100%, transparent 50%);     \n        background-position: 0 1.04em;     \n        background-repeat: repeat-x;     \n        background-size: 1px 1px; \n    }\n\nWhat could be another approach for this? This approach is not responsive, I have a text that is underlined and it has pretty big letters, so when I resize, the phrase 'wraps' itself, but the underline does not (it's a background image).\n\nI appreciate any help/suggestion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit.

Google Ad words advert (nice to have, not earning much anyway)\n3. plugin to track feedback (important to inform funders etc) - auto generated at the bottom of posts.\n4. theme elements - tags and suggested posts.\n5. blank space before footer\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0spapviade61.jpg?width=1620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=797b9225649b1fb73d70013991c06985b533a288\n\nwhat I would like to do is put my ad (2) into the blank space (5) - I know this doesn't optimise positioning etc, but that's not my aim with the website so i'm not bothered.\n\nI think the solution is to create a widget space under the theme elements and then add in my HTML code as I normally would for a widget area.

        "selftext": "I'm looking for a conference website solution with a working backend. A WP theme is preferred. The website needs to:\n\n1. Collect call for speaker submissions (abstracts) along with bio info from possible speakers. Then that data can be graded and selected to present or not. Preferably, emails to the submitters can be auto generated based on if they are selected or not. \n2. Allow admins to easily generate and manage a conference agenda based off of who has been selected and what time and room they are assigned. \n3. Allow users (selected speakers) to create and account with a code or link, so they can log in and submit their headshot, update their session abstract (which is live on the agenda page), submit a PowerPoint file, etc. \n4. Take registrations (using Strip or Square) and send auto confirmation to attendees. \n\nWe had a site built using Angular several years ago and have enough HTML and CSS experience to manage it ourselves, but there is no backend and having to manually format the speaker agenda (dozens of abstracts and headshots) by hand in HTML is a pain. \n\nWe hired someone to rebuild the website (same look, we love the design) into a WP template in the hopes that we can just copy/paste the abstracts from our collection form into WP. We can do this, but the site is clunky with many many boxes to edit. \n\nAt this point, we are looking for another solution. I looked on EnvatoMarket for themes with working backends. They have them for other things (online classes, job boards), but nothing for managing conference/events. I tried Google also and could not find something that was suitable. \n\nIt has to have a backend to make the day-to-day website management easier. Does anyone know of a solution to something like this?  We are looking for a prebuilt solution that we can customize.",

I'm wondering if you've done much professional web development? No disrespect intended.\n\nAs a web developer I want to strangle div abusers daily. It's **objectively** a worse coding experience when your file is longer than say 100 lines. Being able to mentally filter out divs to the background to easily skim for the text I'm looking for only has value to me if I somehow forget CTRL+F exists for searching text. For actually working in the file, once you scroll down and all you see is \n\n              </div>\n              Some Text\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\nI don't know any web developer who would objectively consider that a better experience. I don't know what the hell any of those closing divs represents unless I scroll back up. Or I'm just wasting time collapsing and expanding divs constantly to try and keep the flow in my mind without scrolling back and forth.\n\nUsing the right semantics also helps me search, i.e. if I see <section> or <article> being used, and I'm looking to modify something in the start of every <section>, I know I can jump from <section> to <section> quickly",

That’s obviously going to be a header. \n\nIt’s followed by an anchor tag for the word home, which is obviously going to be the start of a nav bar. \n\nThat continues through the anchor tag for the word “Contact”, which is often the last section of a nav bar. \n\nThat’s followed by the text “Recent Articles”, which will obviously be followed by recent articles. \n\nSure enough, it’s followed by a bulleted list of 3 links, which are probably the recent articles. \n\nThat’s followed by the word “Blog”, which I assume is about to follow the same format I just saw. \n\nSure enough, there’s one word, which presumably a title, followed by a snippet. \n\nThen another. \n\nThat’s followed by the copyright notice, which means I’ve reached the footer. \n\nWhile, in the first example, the sheer volume of different tags (which, again, provide helpful context to bots, which I’m not) makes it hard to drill in and focus on the actual elements, which makes it harder for me to parse them and visualize them. \n\nThere’s just so many more words, making it harder to tell at a glance what’s a tag & what’s content. \n\nWhile, as I’ve said multiple times, the uniformity of “div, div, div” makes it considerably easier for my human eyes and brain to just gloss over them and parse/visualize the actual content section by section.",

And when I turned early 30s, just after Covid, I wanted to start my own studio. Which I did, on the side with a full time job.\n\nLast year, I decided to go into trying to do this full time instead of with the job. First day being self employed, I had same thoughts. I wish I had taken advantage of low competition back then, with seo, and so on.\n\nBut then I reminded myself, skill and knowledge, if mixed with some creative thinking, is far more meaningful . It’s not stock market that I have to rely on time in the market. I reminded myself, I have a solid background and knowledge from working in many agencies, many clients and so on. Everything I did for agencies, bosses, clients, I should once try to implement this on my own business.\n\nJanuary this year, I rebuilt my site which by that time had little to no traffic for the last 1.5 year that domain had been registered. Zero enquiries in 1.5 years. \nThe new rebuilt was my goal saying: I’ll implement my 15sh years of design knowledge of high conversion pages, seo knowledge, content writing and structure knowledge, and rebuilt the site on modern framework so than one day when I start getting traffic i am ready. \n\nI browsed 50-100 popular agency sites which are all pre established for at least 5-10 years each. I was a new 36 year old kid in their block with a domain with zero back links. \n\nBut I had a strategy in mind. A small one. \n\nNow in July, (7months) I am on first page in 3 major  for a a popular web design agency keyword . 15 years ago I worked at an agency that was on first page for years, and today in 6 months my site is just two links under them. \n\nI also optimized my business site to be appearing in LLMs. \n\nIt took 6 months overall and 3 weeks of site built . And I am getting enquiries . (Previously all projects were from word of mouth) I ask these guys, how did you find me, they say Google, chatgpt, Google, Google, Claude, etc.\n\nAnd in my head, I smile. Because something I did right using some learning and got my business up there in 6 months.\n\nPoint is. You have 20 years of knowledge behind you. That knowledge is gold. Mix that gold with some creativity, some hacks, ingenuity , wisdom, experience. And you’ll still beat many players in the game. They have manpower, money, but you have experience, which is worth way more. \n\nI also cracked 3 clients from another agency who’s number one for a keyword on Google in 3 cities. 3 unhappy clients from them, found me on Google and signed up with me. \n\nSo again, you’re not old, you have not missed your chance, you might be a slow burn, long term, experienced player. Endurance horse race is a sport, where it’s not about how fast a horse runs but about how long it can go, and usually it’s not the fastest but horse with endurance wins. You don’t have to have shiny office, or proven case studies, but if you have knowledge of 2 decades, used wisely you can beat 80% of the so called competitors. \n\nThanks for reading my short essay",

It's not as gripping as \"Gone with the Wind\", but each trip down the rabbit hole brings up something you may never have considered: New ways to handle specific object types; Clearly bad examples for how to do things; exposure to functions and operators you might not normally use; etc. \n\nMost companies keep their code private so you only see it if you work for them. An open source project library like Github is an incredible learning opportunity, because you can see how various projects are organized, and how specific functions are implemented. As you go, you may find you have a solution for a problem, or a better way to implement a function: try it out, and if it works you can propose your patch. Do that enough and people will start to know who you are, and that may lead to job offers you wouldn't have normally pursued.",

I still work in it today, so I try to reframe my nostalgia—not as some old guy shaking his fist at clouds, but more as someone who lived through a rare, creative golden age.\n\nWhen I entered the field, the web felt like uncharted territory. It was exciting, full of discovery and freedom. You could crack open Notepad, write a few lines of HTML, and suddenly have something on the internet. Learning tables, slicing up images, adding animated GIFs. Back buttons, next buttons—all jumping around the screen like excited kids.\n\nAnd then came Flash. Sound, motion, interaction. Sure, it got abused, but it also gave us unforgettable digital environments—studios like 2Advanced or eye4u made things that felt like stepping into another world. It was more than a job. It was play.\n\nThe web was an incredible place 20-30 years ago. Now? Accessibility (while crucial) has limited creative expression. Phones shrunk the canvas. Engagement metrics replaced curiosity. Scroll culture replaced exploration. We’re buried in frameworks, version control, environments, package managers, and libraries on top of libraries. There’s less wonder, more boilerplate. More stack overflow, less spark.\n\nThe web grew up—and so did we.\n\nStill, I’m grateful I came up during that era—when both the web and I were still figuring things out.\n\nAs for “could’ve done more”—yeah, I feel that too. I’ve got friends who’ve been on TED stages and others earning insane salaries. Me? I struck a work/life balance. Made good money. Saved even more. But now, with kids who are 18 and 16, I sometimes feel a little hollow. Like I poured more into my family than into my own ambition.\n\nI don’t ache for the past out of longing—I ache because I lived it. I experienced what the web was—raw, creative, full of wonder. I got to build in that space when it was still a frontier. That’s why it stings a little. Because I know exactly what we’ve lost.\n\nNo regrets (maybe a little?)—just reflection.

The LLM tells them anything they would have found on a site, so the site isn't necessary anymore. You can still set up a personal web site or a business site, and I'm sure they'll still be a lot of those, but they'll be quaint afterthoughts.\n\nAs for social, I'm hoping the fediverse sorts itself out and becomes a thing since it would be decentralized, but I don't know if that will happen or catch on.\n\nOtherwise, I think the Internet is going to be a lot of apps and LLMs for the most part.

I recently wrote [a guide on semantic HTML](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/dev/semantic-html-accessibility/) that discusses when you *shouldn't* use divs, and when some of the other HTML elements may be more suitable. You may find this helpful.\n\nYou may also want to give this guide a read: [Creating a Responsive Navbar Without Bootstrap](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/dev/responsive-navbar-without-bootstrap/).\n\nIf you're building a navbar, yes, `nav`, `ul`, `li`, and `a` are probably going to be your go-to elements. But you can also use `div`s; there's nothing wrong with using them.\n\nFor example, my website's navigation `ul` is wrapped in a `div`. This gives me a clickable mask layer on mobile when the menu is expanded. This lets you close the menu by clicking the mask layer (i.e., clicking off to the side). This is a common strategy with modal windows, too, where you can click the mask layer to close the modal window.\n\nI hope that helps!",

However, on the largest screen size if you shrink the viewport to the smallest size horizontally, the items look squished (because they are percentage based).  As the designer I'm okay with this design but I haven't seen very many modern looking sites have elements that squish when you resize it horizontally. \n\nMost either rearrange the material or simply remove it as the screen resizes and obviously there are min-values which hardcodes a minimum size for elements on the screen and prevents them from appearing squished. But I'm curious, is it generally bad practice these days to make the elements behave in this way when the screen is resized. ",

Unless adding woocommerce or super specific plugins such as payment gateways, wordfence etc I keep it minimal as possible.\n\nThis gives complete control over the design and no making compromises due to theme choice or being booted with spaghetti code.\n\nACF makes it so the layout and design control of pages is in the theme code, not the WP editor. You can then make the content editing as minimal or advanced as you need. Of course you can blend ACF fields to styles and layouts but that’s up to you eg: a select field for “card style” where each card contains the same title, content and image fields.\n\nI personally prefer this route as if building a client website they can’t mangle the layout or appearance and can still have flexibility through repeatable layout blocks and components through ACF if required.",

This is the product archive that I have been working on. When I filter for all products, or just miter saws, my custom css works fine, but it breaks when it is just the table saw and tries to default to the widget's default styling. The widget I used is called Woo Product Grid.\n\nI've added images of the relevant sections of the css and the inspected html and I don't see any tags that are different that would be interrupting the styling, and the javascript is pulling the data from the same product archive, so I don't think it would be anything there either.\n\nEdit: All of the products are supposed to be in a div that looks like the ones for the miter saws, but it doesn't apply to the Table Saw when it's been filtered out by itself.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

Each column alternates bottom-to-top transition in, top-to-bottom transition in. Once the columns settle, the center image is scaled up into main view, while all other images are scaled down. When the center image reaches its maximum scaled up state, a video auto starts from the same point in the image.\n\nI have tried to replicate this transition with CSS, but cannot capture the same vibe (see below).

I usually wing it, as you say, because I can visualize most of the structure in my head already and I've done these kind of pages multiple times (*users lists, settings page, forms, tables, whatever*). I already know that most of the \"real\" content will come out as soon as I start coding it. You can \"imagine\" the basic elements (lists, drop down menus, avatars, ....) but every client has its own requirements. So I really love coding the entire structure via HTML/CSS and then style it in a different way, each time. My last \"control panel\" for a medical app [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/8U0eGvP.png) and it was in part inspired by something I've seen online (I save screenshots/template when I like something).\n\nFor **websites/ecommerces** it depends on what the client needs. If I get enough details (example: I want a big photo, 4 main clickable areas, a list of products, etc) I can draw it in my mind and CSS/HTML it already. Again, peeking at some screenshots helps me with palettes and fonts, sometimes. [This specific page/website](https://i.imgur.com/qGYOIZV.png) was designed on the go using the company's official leaflets/catalogues as an inspiration. I had something to \"visualize\" it in my head and I coded it already, no need to draw/mockup anything else.\n\nPWA projects are a middle ground between \"improvise\" and \"follow these bullet points\". So there is not a golden rule, for me at least. Each client is different. Generally speaking though, simple/technical PWA's are extremely easy to design in my opinion. I always use a FAB menu (floating button) as you can [see here](https://i.imgur.com/2CX9x4A.png) which [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/AiaPUW3.png) when you open it. Everything else is done via grid and some good stacking, it's not hard at all.\n\n[This one](https://micio.app/) (which will be my own freelance page) was coded in a boring afternoon while I was perfecting the best way to get [100/100/100/100](https://i.imgur.com/uSDZ0jU.png) on Chrome's Lighthouse (which really depends on your physical location too, I'm from Italy and the server is in UK).\n\nI am used to work with CSS/HTML already because it lets me play with mobile/desktop/responsive stuff while designing everything and I can test it on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, whatever (I use LambdaTest for multiple platform testing).

Or maybe let me try yellow and italic?*).\n\nBut that's just the barebone code to have the non-styled elements on the page. Some buttons, a table, an avatar, a drop-down list, etc. stuff that I know the app/page needs and I just want to organize and \"prettify\" with my css.\n\nBy doing so, I can style everything on the go (margins, colors, paddings, borders, ... ) as well as optimize and change the code for the mobile view. Very often I need to adapt something because the available data makes it look worse than a nice demo with perfect avatars and short, comfortable names. I can see how it behaves with weird content and adjust it in a second. A table with 10 columns is a good example, you really need to \"see it in action\" both on mobile and desktop to check if it works. What fields do I need on mobile? What structure do I apply to the table to make it easy to understand on a cellphone?\n\nCoding it makes it extremely easy to \"visualize\" it, in my opinion.",

They allow non-techs to build functioning web experiences for their business. But they have limitations and expectations for how a business runs, and will not be customizable outside of a certain set of boundaries. Sounds like that is  the point you are at right now. \n\nSo you have two options:\n\n - Bend the template as close as you can to the business needs and make due with whatever the discrepancy is\n - Hire someone to help you customize the experience.\n\nAs the kind of guy who gets hired to do something like this, I can't emphasize how much better the first option is going to be for you. If you can, in any way, get something that approximates meeting your needs up without hiring a dev, it's going to be worlds cheaper and will get finished. If you hire a dev, it could cost a lot of money, take a lot of time, and will still end up in some state of compromise. \n\nThis is 25 years of experience talking; if you can't make enough money back to justify hiring a dev (thousands of dollars) then you should settle for a site that does ~80% of what you want and go home happy.\n\nIt's not worth breaking down the technicals here too far, but what you're going to need at minimum is a custom WP plugin that does math the way you have envisioned. I am not sure what the going rate is on that, but I know it's not a one-shot deal; Wordpress continues to evolve and any custom work is going to need to stay upgraded. That means you need a dev who will be around, along with being capable of the work. That's basically not a thing, despite any assurances someone provides you. The website may have a shelf life of like 10 years. Do you want to assume the dev's life will stay static, and that their rate of pay will stay stable, etc.? \n\nHopefully that makes the point well enough. \n\nThe one thing I would offer as a piece of technical advice, is that it sounds like you could, if you really wanted to, solve the quote wizard piece with a Google form with custom scripting. That would at least give a solution that isn't coupled to a CMS, but it would possibly be weird, still cost money or cause you to have to pass a steep learning curve, and would end up being a compromise. \n\nMuch luck to you. I hope it works out!",

From your description it seems like the biggest problems are\\\\\n\n* organizing and confirming with people (so gathering information about what they want)\n* calculating the quote based on gathered data\n* making the process fully self-service (no communications with a real person)\n\nTackling all of them at the same time would be too big of a bite IMO, but each part on its own is manageable.\n\nFor the order information gathering part, I'd start with this:\n\n* Review existing email / communication threads with past clients and see what the most common topics that need clarification are\n* Create a comprehensive list of what you absolutely need to know for each type of order based on your findings\n* If required, draw a branching logic flow for each service type (e.g. if customer needs three-color screen print, also ask *which* three colors are needed and so on)\n* Try out [typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) to create this flow. Typeform lets you create logic-based flows, upload files, require number-based answers etc; I think it should be possible to most types of questions you'd need.\n* Boom, you now have the information gathering part done. Typeform will send you all the information once the customer has answered all questions in the flow.\n\nNext part is the quote calculation. \n\n* Typeform allows performing calculations on the provided answers - say, multiply item amount with the cost corresponding to the chosen print area size. It may be finicky to implement, but you don't need any web development skills to do it.\n* If Typeform doesn't fit the bill for quote calculations, you can try [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) integration and put all the [Typeforms data into a Google form](https://zapier.com/apps/google-forms/integrations/typeform), which might be a more familiar environment. Zapier can also do multiple things - once Typeform is filled out and quote is calculated, you can send the gathered information + the quote to the clients provided email, for example. It lets you integrate with a bunch of software with no-code automations.\n* This part might be the most hard, but I think it's still doable on your own. Boom, you now have both data gathering + quote calculation done.\n\nNext part is making it all fully self-service, like include payments and have a button to click that confirms the order, etc. Maybe it turns out that you don't really need it and the process works fine already; maybe you decide you want to make it all more permanent and create a custom solution. The great thing is that at this point, you would have a working prototype, which serves as documentation for whoever you would hire. You could say \"I need a solution that abides by the same logic, but also does payments\", which is much easier to quote and estimate for the contractor instead of a vague description. Also that saves you money - someone would still need to figure out all that aforementioned stuff out on paper, and it takes billable hours.\n\nHope you find some of this valuable, and good luck!",

This means the `search-bar` will inherit styles from the form. There’s no necessary connection for an element with the class `search-bar` if it’s not within a form, especially since you've used a `div`.\n\nIt seems like you’re asking if creating a search bar outside of a form would still inherit styles from the form. The answer is no; it won’t inherit those styles unless it’s inside the form.\n\n**Please stop opening the same topic in multiple groups.

        "selftext": "Sorry for the vague title. I'm not sure where else to go for this so I figured I would start here. I'm trying to set up a communications/correspondence system for my stepdad. He makes money by buying tractors, fixing them up, and selling them. He's great with that stuff, but he's very tech illiterate. He seems to operate fine by word of mouth but there's only so many people in our area who need tractors, y'know? He wants to be able to reach more people, so he floated the idea to me that I list his tractors on Facebook marketplace, but I don't want to do that because it would be through my account and I don't want to be the middleman, mainly because I *will* forget. So I was thinking about setting up a website for him since that would offer a way for him to receive messages directly without having to go through me, and I would just manage listings and maintenance, maybe not even maintenance if I just use a website platform. He doesn't have an email address (we are talking very old school, very tech un-savvy here), and I know that the way most websites receive correspondence from visitors is through email. My question is: is there a way to set it up so that any messages the website receives, they would go directly to my stepdad's text messages? I'm pretty sure he knows how to text, but at the very least I could specify that potential customers just need to include their phone number, and I can show him how to make calls from numbers sent in the body of a text message since that's basically child's play for someone like me who knows their way around basic smartphone functions. Thank you in advance! Or if you know of a more appropriate alley for me to post this, thank you for sending me that way! ",

I found out that they just don't work.\n\nWhat I want to fond is a CMS that would work like subscription-based services (\\*folio, tilda, \\*respace, etc) but on my own server without subscription, maybe with 1-time purchase if the product is working. I need to have it all in one place, my place.\n\nI'm using Wordpress right now for years already but it is not a portfolio engine. It has too much of unnecessary features that I'm not utilizing and they make it clunky and very limited. And it has very cluttered theme engine that makes it complicated to make templates quickly. Its own themes don't allow a lot of things that modern portfolio websites use. So Wordpress is half-measure which gives half-result.\n\nMaybe you know some decent portfolio CMS?",

                "body": "**Position**\n\nDon't think of `position` as a property with which you can define the *position* of an element, but as a property with which you can define the *positioning method* of an element, and how it interacts with the elements close to it, e.g. parents, children, siblings.\n\n* `static`: The default. The element will \"go with the flow\" of the document. If you have three elements they will generally be displayed next to each other or below each other (depending on `display`), not on top of each other. Other than that `static` is very non-confrontational regarding elements around it.\n* `relative`: Acts a lot like `static` but can be positioned with directional properties (`top`, `left`, etc.). Any absolutely positioned children (or children of children etc.) will be positioned relative to this element.\n* `fixed`: Doesn't give a shit about its surroundings. Acts like a postit on your screen. If you scroll down its still there. If you set `top` to `0` the element will be put at the top of your screen and stay there. Note that all the properties of `relative` also apply here (with children being positioned relative to this one).\n* `absolute`: If you have three elements below each other and you give the middle one `position: absolute`, the third element will be put where the second one used to be, whereas the middle one is on top of it. If you don't give the absolutely positioned element any position (with `top`, `left`, etc.) it'll still be where it was when it was static, but if you do give it a position, those properties will be relative to its closest `relative` parent or, if there is no relative parent, the document. If you scroll the page, the element will scroll like this text you are reading if you scroll. Note that all the properties of `relative` also apply here (with children being positioned relative to this one).\n* `sticky`: Quite a new addition. The basic idea is to make an element act like `fixed` as long as its parent is visible and the element itself is visible in its entirety, but like `absolute` if those conditions are not met. It \"sticks\" to its parent, so to speak, a bit like a scrollbar of an element on a page that also scrolls.\n\nWith all \"positions\" other than `static` you can use `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` to define the actual position and `z-index` to define the \"stacking order\"\n\n**z-index**\n\nDoesn't work for `position: static` at all. In all other cases a higher `z-index` generally means it's more to the \"front\". If you have a blue element with a `z-index` of `1` and a red element with a `z-index` of `2` and you place them on top of each other, the red one will be \"on top\", no matter which one comes first in the HTML.\n\nTake the following structure.\n\n    <div class=\"a\">\n      <div class=\"b\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"c\"></div>\n\nLet's say that `a` has a `static` position and `b` and `c` are relatively positioned. In this case, if `b` has a higher `z-index` than `c`, `b` will be on top of `c`.\n\nHowever, let's now say that all three elements are relatively positioned. `a` has a `z-index` of 1, `b` has a `z-index` of **20** and `c` has a `z-index` of `3`. Now `c` will be on top of both `a` and `b`. The `z-index` of `b` is \"ignored\" because it's contained within `a`, which is *not* `static`. But if there were an element `d`, also within `a`, which had a `z-index` of `5`, it would be below `b`. `b` and `d` are in a different \"stacking context\" than `a` and `c`.\n\nKeep in mind that all of those rules regarding `z-index` would apply even if `b` were `absolute` for example.\n\nI think that's about everything.",

If the parent element is static on the other hand, the absolutely positioned child will \"ignore\" that specific parent and instead be positioned relative to its closest relative container (e.g. parent of parent, or further up) or ultimately the document if there's no relative parent element.",

                "body": "I think you have a good base there. Here are some thoughts from a UI standpoint:\n\n* At first glance, of even just the preview image, the layout looks a bit floaty with the white  panel centered and then two sand coloured panels either side. You might anchor it better by using a darker colour on the left panel, or even on the nav, and then short of getting lighter as you make your way to the right. Does that make sense? It would also add some hierarchy. The last panel should be the most important but there's noting visually to indicate that, for example you could float it above the rest of the page with a soft shadow along it's left edge, so it's visually closer to the user.\n* Look at heading sizes, much of the text is the same size and it means your eye gets lost as you start looking around with no clear vertical direction. You might need one at the top of each 3 sections too.\n* You say it's for movies, books and shows, but there's not much to indicate it, especially with IP's that are across different media. Is that what category is, to choose media type? Does 'Director' and the other dropdown only display according to the category? Also add tags within item descriptions, eg 'The Owl House' = 'TV Series, Series 3'.\n* At the bottom of the right panel you also have 'Watched' which wouldn't be appropriate for a book, so you could rename it to 'Time spent on' or something similar.\n* The buttons and filters could use the same font size. Maybe 'Remove' could be outlined with clear fill for differentiation. How about adding icons next to the button text too.\n* Where you have the rating slider, I'd also add a manual input here for accessibility.\n* The rating itself could look a bit more exciting as well, right? Could make it bigger, pull it out next to a bigger title, increase the colour saturation the higher the score is, add thumb up icon if it's good - things like that.\n* Edit - I just noticed the third panel is actually a popup and might not there be constantly. If so, what fills that space otherwise? Could you expand the center list to 2 or 3 columns of content instead?\n\nHope that helps!",

Is there a beneficial psychological thing behind such design?** Are we assuming that the potential client or visitor wants to figure out what the hell a certain web is about and seeing that his first impact, his first visit is greeted with basically nothing and a small symbol telling him to scroll - will this cause a psychological self-driven need for discovery?\n\nIs it better to offer some kind of information on the website as the visitor arrives to it, or is there actually proven science behind offering as little information as possible to the visitor, leading him to exploration of the web?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* At what point does this exploration backfire and how far can it be abused? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Most modern sites are beginning to use hamburger menus even in desktop format** : Is this again a psychological game, making the visitor make a move towards exploration? Is the general idea behind modern web design to assume a child-like adventurous behavior of the potential visitor instead of someone who knows what he wants and wants it \"now\"?\n\n**Are these modern web sites assuming that their potential customer will visit their site only once** and immediately ask for an offer/quote? I tried revisiting some of them throughout the day and quickly realized that it is a pain to navigate through these sites - most of their useful information is not hard-linked through the menu bar, but requires of me to scroll through various animations starting with an almost blank header full-width section which does nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It seems to me that most of these \"modern\" webs are trying to look like a book with a cover. Some of these covers end up being very bland, offering almost no information and require potential visitors to really \"scroll through the book\" in order to get some ideas behind what the website and company are all about. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs this specifically done on purpose to make the customer spend more time on the website?\n\n**What are your thoughts on this?**",

Keep it very simple and plain, and then let users discover their way to what they need. \n\nAlso, there's some old idea still going around that you need to cram as much information in above the fold as possible. Not true. I'm so tired of working with people obsessed with keeping content above the fold and sacrificing \"breathability\" in the design for it. [Above the fold is a myth](http://abovethefold.fyi/). People scroll and explore by habit.\n\n**Why are modern sites using hamburger menus?**\n\nI would say it's most likely due to lazy design practice. It's a way bigger effort to make different menu styles for desktop vs tablet/mobile so developers just make the hamburger menu because it *works* on desktop too. It's the least common denominator in a way. Also, a lot of websites have a majority of their users coming from the mobile platforms and not PCs, so this is clearly prioritized.\n\n**Do they assume a user only visits once?**\n\nMore often than not, yes. Also, the way most websites are structured is to be able to measure conversion rates. You want a funnel that you can lead users through and be able to measure and improve. \n\nBtw, the book \"Hello, Startup\" talks about all these points in a very easy to understand way. Can't recommend it enough.",

Here's an article on NNG about folds in web design: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/page-fold-manifesto/\n\nBy having a full-bleed header image on your site, you risk creating those \"artificial floors\" referenced in the article. You also waste above-the-fold space, where users spend *most* of their time.\n\nIt can be done effectively--it works best when the page is telling a story. So it wouldn't be suitable for the homepage for something like Amazon, but it could work for a page selling an individual product--where it's telling you the product's story.\n\nTake a look at the Adobe website. The homepage is just the header navigation, a \"start trial\" button, and three boxes directing visitors to the sections most relevant to them. They can't have a long page telling a \"story\" for their homepage because they have so many products and different target customers. \n\nHowever, when you go to the detail view for a specific product (e.g. https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?promoid=RL89NFBP&mv=other ) it does have a (nearly) full-screen header with a small amount of text. They also left a white border at the bottom to avoid creating the aforementioned \"artificial floors\". The header section has the most important content--the \"start trial\" and the \"buy now\" buttons--so people who are already familiar with/don't want to bother reading all the details can skip straight to those steps. And when you scroll, it tells you more details, shows you examples, and tells you a \"story\".\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that although above the fold content remains the most important part of many pages, it is becoming less so https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolling-and-attention/ \n\nAnother point to consider is that doing this might cause some degree of \"banner blindness\" like what happens with carousels, where users immediately scroll without looking at the content at all, just to get it out of the viewport.\n\n#Hamburger Navigation\n\nI guess it could be used to direct the visitor's attention, but generally considered bad UX design: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/\n\n#Are these modern web sites assuming that their potential customer will visit their site only once\n\nThat's an interesting point. It's also not unreasonable, for many products, although good UX design allows for multiple ways to get to the same point, so they should always have navigation to skip to a specific section.",

But NOW, it's become a standard UI component.  If thought goes into information architecture, hamburgers aren't an issue, because everyone knows that \"about\", \"Contact\", \"Settings\" etc are behind the hamburger.  That being said, often times it's still a matter of \"Everyone else has a hamburger, I want one too\" lazy design.\n\nJust my 2 cents.",

I would love to learn this way, and be able to edit people's WP sites this way so I can show them my vision for improvements to their pre-existing sites.\n\nThanks for the help wp gang!",

Option A: Make the box appear full-width and be scrollable*\n\nTry wrapping the table in a <div> tag like this:\n\n`<div style=\"display: block; max-width: 100%; overflow: auto; white-space: nowrap;\">`\n\n`...table code...`\n\n`</div>`\n\nThe max-width and overflow values should force the table to be scrollable horizontally in cases where it's too wide to fit naturally. The white-space property tells text objects they can't wrap around and should only be 1 line unless there's an actual line break. The white-space bit may be better applied to your table cells (td elments) in CSS to be sure your text will be affected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*2. Option 2: Doing a vertical list instead of a table*\n\nYour information in this case actually doesn't make sense as a table. The left->right orientation of properties is great for when multiple items are being presented, but you only have 2 total rows in your table, heading and 1 set of values. Presenting *one* set of key/value pairs at a time is easier for humans to parse as a list like this:\n\n>Points: 10000000  \n>  \n>Coupon Code: QBYZR  \n>  \n>Amount Left: $10000000  \n>  \n>...*etc*\n\nSo, for that you can use a basic list:\n\n`<ul><li><b>Points</b>: 10000000</li><li><b>Coupon Code</b>: QBYZR</li><li><b>Amount Left</b>: $10000000</li></ul>`\n\nIf you don't want the basic list styling with • symbols, do `padding-left: 0;` on the <ul> and `list-style: none;` on the <li> tags",

I'm now working on my homepage, and the WHOLE CONCEPT - the only way my idea works - is that there's a button at the bottom, and clicking it takes you to a different, random one of the 31 (and growing) child pages. Then a button at the bottom of each of those pages that does the same thing.  \n\nGoogle produces results for how to generate a random link, but only if you're raw-coding or how to create a link in Elementor just in general with no mention of random. Of course there are plug-ins for WordPress but none work with Elementor. I don't feel like paying $89 to unlock functionality in some app that will let me do it because I don't expect I'll ever make a dime from this site - it's for the lulz but I'll freely admit it's the kind of thing you go once, you go \"Haaaaa!\" and you'll never go back.  \n\nCan someone explain to me a method for executing this functionality in a way that will work with my Elementor pages?",

        "author": "RabbitsFoot8",
        "id": "jenw5y",
        "selftext": "A few weeks ago [**tiiny.host**](https://tiiny.host) (a simple way to share your web project) launched a deal but presented it in a creative way:\n\n[Original order-based price tiered component](https://preview.redd.it/o48wkiv4m8u51.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b84a96f499f1ac9fafdfd021096b8294e43068)\n\nA few asked how it was made so I wanted to break it down for others.\n\nThe original was created with react & bootstrap so I re-created it in pure HTML & CSS to breakdown it's components. Feel free to use the component yourself if you like it :)\n\n\\---------------\n\nThe container is a simple, rounded rectangle with a white background featuring two child divs:\n\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <div class=\"price-tiers-container\">\n    \n        <!-- Prices tiers go here -->\n    \n      </div>\n      <div class=\"features-container\">\n    \n        <!-- Prices tiers go here -->\n    \n      </div>\n    </div>\n\nLet’s look at the price tiers first. These contained three further divs wrapped by the price-tiers-container class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price-tiers container](https://preview.redd.it/j1rade27m8u51.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2d3f848c97cc461d7cb9c472064bce2ad0cd94)\n\nIn order to make the divs extend out of it’s parent container class we needed to apply the `position: absolute` for price-tiers-container. We also ensured it had a fixed width and used a flex layout to divide the space amongst the three price tiers.\n\nThe final class looked like this:\n\n    .price-tiers-container {\n        display: flex;\n        position: absolute;\n        width: 530px;\n    }\n\nWithin this we have three price-tier divs with these styles:\n\n    .price-tier {\n        flex: 3;\n    \n        display: flex;\n        flex-direction: column;\n        justify-content: space-between;\n    \n        background: white;\n        border: solid 2px #c1c1c1;\n        border-radius: 8px;\n        margin-top: 10px;\n        margin-left: 10px;\n        padding: 12px;\n    }\n\nEach price-tier is given a default equal width by setting flex of 3 (but the active one is flex: 4). We also use flex to align items within the price-tier div and space the items evenly using `justify-content: space-between`. Finally we apply some individual border, padding etc styles.\n\nWithin each price tier we just have three divs:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Non-active price tier](https://preview.redd.it/8invrrs8m8u51.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&s=017fe020054d8fec8ef1fe4c4b267b1a9c1381ec)\n\n    .title {\n        color: grey;\n    }\n    \n    .price {\n        font-size: 1.5rem;\n    }\n    \n    .price-period {\n        font-size: 0.7rem;\n    }\n    \n    .label {\n        font-size: 0.8rem;\n    }\n    \n    <div class=\"price-tier\">\n      <div class=\"title\">\n        Stage 2\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"price\">\n        <b>$99</b><span class=\"price-period\"> / onetime</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"label\">Coming soon</div>\n    </div>\n\nWith the active price tier, the set up is slightly different:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Active price tier](https://preview.redd.it/so79jrt9m8u51.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1138ba16d1ee9c13e96d58e13363853b5d3393c)\n\n    .active {\n        border-color: blue;\n        flex: 4 **!important**;\n        height: 150px;\n    }\n    \n    <div class=\"price-tier active\">\n      <div class=\"p-title\">\n        Stage 1\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"price\">\n        <b>$59</b><span class=\"price-period\"> / onetime</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"progress-bar\">\n        3/50 sold\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\nThe active price-tier swaps out the label for a progress-bar and applies the active class as well. To make it more prominent we assign it a fixed height, override the default `border-color` and increase the flex to 4.\n\nAdditionally, we grey out the content in the non-active price-tiers like so:\n\n    .price-tier > div {\n        opacity: 0.4;\n    }\n    \n    .active > div {\n        opacity: 1;\n    }\n\nFinally in order to make the progress bar in the active price tier we use a css-gradient trick:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Progress bar](https://preview.redd.it/et7ay62bm8u51.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3f9e7157f8ee9004836a0c8dc09933ffe06906)\n\n    .p-progress-bar {\n        background: linear-gradient(90deg, #2BC147 0%, #2BC147 15%, #575757 15%, #575757 100%);\n        color: white;\n        border-radius: 8px;\n        width: 100%;\n        font-size: 0.7rem;\n    }\n\nWe set the background to 90 degree but set the green `(#2BC147)` at 0% and 15% and the the grey `(#575757)` at 15% and 100%. This gives the illusion of a progress bar. If we need to increase the progress then we just modify 15% to the new progress level.\n\nFinally, we complete the features-container:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Features container](https://preview.redd.it/7m1tgumgm8u51.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=4727576cc44b01adc208ad7e1b6739e89a6692ec)\n\n    .features-container {\n        display: flex;\n        flex-wrap: wrap;\n        justify-content: center;\n        padding: 168px 12px 12px 12px;\n        align-content: space-evenly;\n    }\n    \n    .feature::before {\n        content: '✅ ';\n    }\n    \n    .feature {\n        margin: 3px;\n        font-size: 0.8rem;\n    }\n    \n    <div class=\"features-container\">\n      <div class=\"feature\">This feature</div>\n      <div class=\"feature\">And this</div>\n      <div class=\"feature\">Great at this</div>\n      <div class=\"feature\">Plus this feature</div>\n    </div>\n\nHere, we use a flex layout again and set `align-content: space-evenly` to evenly space the list of features within the container.\n\nWe apply large top padding of `168px` to leave space for the `pricing-tier-container`. This is because it has `position: absolute` meaning it takes no space in parent div. In order for it to not overlap we reserve artificial space for it.\n\nWe apply a `::before` selector to each feature and set the content to a tick emoji (you can use anything) to add ticks to each item.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Putting it altogether in pure CSS & HTML](https://preview.redd.it/nbxvtxjcm8u51.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9911add169906382d8b628bee2a3a78210f9990)\n\nAnd that’s it!

Of course, this would be true if all the child elements of the newly established BFC were all block-level child elements, but inline-level child elements of the newly established BFC would be, of course, laid out next to one another.\n\nSo, is MDN's statement incorrect, or do I have a misunderstanding of it?",

In either event stick to editing the child theme after looking to see if the original theme's author specifies a specific means to update the CSS.\n\nAlso, look to see to make sure that the logo file is not being coded with WordPress's own functions to place an image file into the website. In your browser, right click on the logo, then select \"INSPECT\". In the \"Elements\" tab in the inspection dialog, i.e., the code that comes up in the inspection tool, look to see if you can see a URL pointing to the logo file. If so, it is likely WordPress has been coded to load the image file into the code directly, rather than the CSS having been setup to use  \"background-image\". If you look within the \"Style\" tab and scroll around, you may see a background-image being defined for the logo.",

But I am in a bit of a pickle, because building websites from scratch with these technologies is time-consuming, which makes it hard to make a comfortable living when dealing with the majority of the small businesses I do work for.\n\nThankfully WordPress has been a great lifesaver, as it comes with a lot of functionality out of the box, and most people are familiar with it, or at the very least have heard of it. However, I feel like I lack the design freedom that I have through hand-coding websites. Even child themes can be time-consuming and challenging, especially when trying to execute specific designs that clients want.\n\nI have recently started to work on a project with Divi, but I just feel like it is going against my nature as a developer, should I get over this? Has anyone been in a similar situation? What are your thoughts?\n\nI appreciate all answers.\n\nAnd apologies in advance if this is not the right place for this question.",

Even simpler, you can stack your absolute positioned slides (divs with background images, that’s what I mean, so you can have an image with text on it as well) on top of each other and animate their opacity. Again, if you want to keep things suuuper  basic.\n\nYour keyframes read: bounce from 0% to 100% height twice every 10 seconds, but apply the animation with 3 seconds delays to the slides. Which means that when the first slide is going to be on its 50% or 5 seconds (100 % height) the second slide will be on its, what, 2 nd out of 10 seconds, so 20% of the animation? It does not add up, imho. Plus, because you set the image width to be auto, the browser calculates its width for you, the image will resize on its height without losing the proportion (if I’m correct), so they will scale on both dimensions without losing proportion.\n\nI don’t know man, there are plenty of css slideshow examples you can learn from (try w3school), this one is a good exercise to learn, but it won’t work the way it currently is. \nI found the resource you used to reach this result, but the code is very different, the timing is too and, by itself, it’s really not a good execution.

        "title": "How to create a drop-down nav menu with CSS",
        "author": "gf99b",
        "id": "en0v1r",
        "selftext": "First - I'm new here. I did web design in high school but stopped doing it for a while. I'm currently a junior in college who recently got burned out on what I'm actually doing (journalism) so I decided to press restart on my web design career and learn more. (Unfortunately, I'm so far along in my present major and my school doesn't offer a web design program so I'm having to teach myself a lot.) Thanks to some renewed interest, confidence, W3Schools and help from a mentor on campus, I was able to learn the basics of responsive design and I'm eventually going to turn my standalone site into a WordPress-based site.\n\nBut I'm going to have some questions along the way. I've posted some questions on StackOverflow but the response wasn't that good, so I thought I'd try this subreddit. I apologize if any of my questions are dumb questions.\n\nMy first problem is about a drop-down menu I'm trying to implement into my design. I used a flexbox as a \"container\" for my navigation bar, and each menu item is essentially an item in an unordered list. It appears to be a pretty standard setup. Something like this, where the \"ul.nav\" class is for the flexbox, and \"li.nitem\" is the styling for the individual list items. It functions perfectly.\n\n    <ul class=\"nav\">\n        <li class=\"nitem\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 1\">Item 1</a></li>\n        <li class=\"nitem\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 2\">Item 2</a></li>\n        <li class=\"nitem\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 3\">Item 3</a></li>\n    </ul>\n\nThe hitch comes to when I try to add a drop-down menu. The menu is a horizontal menu that is in the same row as my logo, so space is limited. I followed [this tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/solved-with-css-dropdown-menus/) and it makes sense until I try to implement it myself. I keep getting hung up on the classes.\n\nI gather that `ul li ul` will affect the second-tier list and `ul li ul li` will affect the individual items in that second tier list. But how can I translate that into using my styles? Obviously, I may have other lists on a page and I'm worried that using standard ul and li may affect those lists.\n\nI was thinking of doing something like this, where \"ul.nav\" is still the flexbox for the entire menu, \"li.ni1\" is styling for first-tier items, \"ul.ndd2\" is the second-tier list, and \"li.ni2\" is the second-tier items. Obviously I know how to implement this in the HTML, but not sure how to get the CSS to work for it. I tried replacing the longer ul/li chains with the classes (for example, `ul li ul li` would become `li.ni2`.)\n\n    <ul class=\"nav\">\n        <li class=\"ni1\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 1\">Item 1</a></li>\n        <li class=\"ni1\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 2\" aria-haspopup=\"true\">Item 2</a>\n            <ul class=\"ndd2\" aria-label=\"Dropdown\">\n                <li class=\"ni2\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item A\">Item A</a></li>\n                <li class=\"ni2\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item B\">Item B</a></li>\n            </ul></li>\n        <li class=\"ni1\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 3\">Item 3</a></li>\n    </ul>\n\nAlso, in the CSS on the tutorial site (and others) I've noticed something like this.\n\n    ul li:hover > ul,\n    ul li:focus-within > ul,\n    ul li ul:hover,\n    ul li ul:focus {\n       visibility: visible;\n       opacity: 1;\n       display: block;\n    }\n\nThis may be another dumb question, but what is the function of the `>` greater-than sign?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Once again, I'm sorry if this is a dumb question or not the right place to post a question.",

Frankly it is all about making $$$$$$ for the agency.   The Agency can easily can use the excessive web site in part of their sales press and distract the customer to spend the big bucks.   In the end the site does nothign for the actual user and may even turn off the customer, however the agency make big bank on the project.\n\nFrankly this is why B to B sites, from the larger companies, have in house development teams.

If I change the size of the frame, the children inside should automatically change and preserve all the current ratios.\n\nHowever setting the position of the children to absolute is just one of the things that is causing HAVOC. It seems like once I do that, it is not resizing automatically with the frame. When I change the screen size, the children are leaking out of the frame.

So far nothing weird. The problem is that: it seems to be a massive number of parent <div> and children <div> covering the same areas. That makes me wonder: \"is that REALLY necessary?\". If you can spend a minute inspecting the page, you'll understand what I mean. I'm trying to keep the whole thing simple in my little project here, but I really wonder if I need so many other tools to get the same result;\n\n**2)** this second doubt is more simple: I can't really figure out how they can keep the <div> in the second row (the one with the words Ristoranti, Servizi per la casa, Servizi per auto, Altro)  perfectly left-paired and aligned to the above search bar, even when you gradually resize the viewport. I used the Inspect tool, and basically I saw that they added margin and padding to fill the empty gap on the left of that <div> (again, see screenshots below). But I really can't understand how that kind of solution can work in responsive mode, since they set fixed padding and margin there. \n\nThank you to all those who will find the time to look into this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m33lqs3n6yr91.png?width=1823&format=png&auto=webp&s=942564e570e9292eba2e0dc52cd944fa83596803\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vvp6r3n6yr91.png?width=1817&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cdd9be16375742d832e573d9b9c2df6ed576e20\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clwfzr3n6yr91.png?width=1790&format=png&auto=webp&s=279a9ae7f30416fd84db429d15049c1274b47446",

I learned the hard way that when I code some static page, some markup hierarchy is always bound to change once it gets churned by the framework the devs work with. so for example, I can't trust using ::first, ::last, ::nth-child(even) and stuff like that, but I need to rely on more robust methods (hard-coded class names or js)\n\nedit: about your second question, they used a clever trick. for smaller viewports, there's just some margin on the left side of the menu, equal to the width of the logo above it. the logo has a fixed width (112px including its own padding), so the row below it has a margin-left of 112px\n\nfor bigger viewports, they added this:\n\n    padding-left: calc((100vw - 1144px) / 2 - 161px);\n\nwhich means 100% of the viewport, minus 1144px (which I guess is the outer grid width), divided by 2 minus 161px. I'm not completely sure where does the 161px comes from, but I think the whole thing compiles to 0 (or less than 0) on smaller viewports, so there's no padding. while on bigger viewports it \"imitates\" the gap between the logo and the search bar, so a padding equal to that gap is added.",

How means statically vs dynamically. You write the HTML for your page statically, or by-hand. What Yelp and other developers are doing is adding in a dynamic element to it.\n\nInstead of writing 3 divs directly onto the page by hand, they may have written a Javascript (the final piece to your journey) method that actually *builds those divs for them*. Think about it.. maybe there are 10 pizza shops, maybe 100. You can't code that Statically, so you need Javascript to build those assets for you, inject the proper data, then load them on the page.\n\nThats why the end structure can become chaotic looking. There are ways to optimize later, but I'm personally a fan of more compartments (divs), as there are deeper layers to effect and build.

In real case scenarios nearly all components will need precise fine tuning to look \"good\", especially if you're working with a submitted design that you need to follow.\n\ncase in point: yelp guys most probably didn't want their logo to be HUGE when viewed on widescreen monitors, and tiny AF when viewed on small tablets (I'm excluding mobiles since I saw that they have a separate site for that). so they defined their logo to be 120px wide because they thought it looked good on every viewport. even for a simple case like that, you can't be \"full responsive\": once you define a \"static\" size for an element, it means that all the calculations made around it need to use predefined sizes. in this case, the gap around the logo becomes a product of the width of said logo and the width of the other elements elements that populate that area\n\nlastly, don't focus too much on \"not getting used to bad practices\". personally I think going through the muck is the only way to properly learn how stuff work. Trying to do the \"right thing\" from the get go, most times mean just copy-pasting over complicated code that maybe you can barely understand. on the other hand, implementing stuff the \"bad (but more intuitive) way\" lets you understand the inner workings of the box model from the ground up in an organic way. and when you advance there's always that eureka moment when you realize why other devs do this instead of that.",

These are also industries I’d like to work for, design-wise.\n\nIn the future, I’d like to actually build my full site in Webflow.",

I think mobile first DESIGN yields boring, empty, and hollow designs because what you can fit on mobile doesn’t translate well to desktop. It leaves a lot of empty space and there’s no actual design it feels like. It’s over simplified to the point of lacking any real depth or detail.

This is a pretty high res screenshot - in reality you'd scroll the page.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions/examples they think could work? I've had a look at a wizard approach, but it always felt like a lot of steps.\n\nHappy to DM a link to the hosted version. It's not ready, hence I don't want to publicise it in the post.\n\n**Some context**\n\nThe app is for creating shared tasks with other people. Someone creates the task, invites others and the appropriate people are notified when it's their turn to complete the task.\n\nAnyone can create tasks for free. Users who haven't signed up can access and fill out this creation page. This is the only thing they need to fill out. They are required to create an account when they click the save button if they want to continue. It's imperative this page is clean/exciting as intimidated users are much less likely to fill it out and will bail.\n\nOnce a user creates a task, I imagine they would have little or no interaction with this page again, unless they wanted to create more tasks. Editing would be infrequent (this form is also used to edit).\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nAs you can imagine, this can appeal to a variety of different people. The common use cases I identify on my homepage are:\n\n* At home: *Who's turn is it to take out the rubbish? We know!*\n* In your sharehouse: *Toilets looking a little rough? We can help share the load.*\n* At work: *Share fridge starting to grow fur? Take turns.*\n\nIt can be used in enterprise, families, share houses, between partners. I would always expect it to be adults interacting with the product however, even if children were to receive notifications.\n\n**Devices**\n\nI've built it as a responsive app, meaning it works on mobile. As with a lot of sites, I'd expect as much, if not more traffic on mobile than on desktop. I'm also building a native mobile app that mirrors similar functionality to the website.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt2eihicehz41.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=6031f4245281163e4360b7e9c7df239fe468a445",

        "selftext": " Hey everyone, \n\nI would like some advice. I have worked in I.T for about 5 years now, mostly in System administration. I worked for two small company's which allowed me to learn multiple things in the I.T services industry but I never really specialized in anything. \n\nI decided a year and a half ago to go traveling around Asia and then head to Oz where I could continue working in I.T there. During my time in traveling around in Asia I met my girlfriend and decided to stay here. Unfortunately I can't really work in I.T here due to money and not speaking the Language. As a native English speaker I can only teach English. So what ever spare time i have i put into learning web design and web development. I find my self focusing more on the design side of things as i really like the creative side of it, which I also find a little annoying due to working in I.T I feel like I should be more focused on programming. \n\nI don't really know what to do I keep making design projects in figma and create my designs using HTML CSS and JS and update my portfolio as much as I can.\n\nI have spoken to some friends who own small businesses back home and have created some websites for them for free but they have not hosted them yet, so I just have to put pictures of the projects on my portfolio. \n\nI want to keep making  projects either for myself or for clients so i can build my portfolio up, with the hope of when moving back home I have something to show to possible jobs, or being able to work for myself as a web designer or developer.\n\nI would really like some feed back on my [portfolio](https://dthdesign.github.io/). Any advice on what to focus on or which direction to go in my current circumstance.\n\nThank you",

It's also a good place to put contact data for potential partners that may be interested in working with you, or when you want to expand your business, to put job ads up. Last but not least, you can also use a website to promote and sell merch.\n\nSo I would say you don't need to have a super complex website, but it's always useful to have one that can work as your business card and for people to get updates on what you're up to. You shouldn't get a website just to have a website, but to support and promote your main business, which is your YouTube content.",

The company I work at has a single webmaster and he will be getting close to retirement within the next 5-10 years. I will be talking with him more to get a general idea of what his daily tasks are and whatnot. I was just wondering as someone who has been kinda out of the field/casually in the field in the past, if there is anything I should know about the field as of today. How much has things changed in the 5+ years I’ve been out of it?\n\nI know how to code already and I know the basics of OOP and data structures. I’m not good at it but I can parse code pretty well. I know I want to learn more about servers and configuring them because I had a bad experience with a DHCP server and I want to get my confidence back.\n\nWhen I think about the tech field around the time I was freelancing we didn’t have ai or any of that. Ai was called machine learning and it was still up and coming. The hip new kid on the block was virtualization and this crazy idea called block chain technology.

I hear a lot about Tailwind but I haven't really felt the need to try it.\n\nBut overall, CSS framework usage seems to be a lot more fractured than back in the day when everything was Bootstrap. If your site looks good, works well, and uses modern best practices (e.g. mobile-first design and no HTML4 or table-based layouts lol), then I'm not sure why anybody would care what framework you're using.\n\nimo frontend frameworks are a dime a dozen and are relatively simple to learn.

He took the bold approach itself but the new design look really good. I asked him if was offended with my comments on the design and he said he didn't.

Yes there are complex websites out there, but many I encounter are fairly simple.\n\nHow much longer until you can enter a prompt like  -  “make me a website similar to oracle.com, but make the color scheme blue and white, and put the menu on the right side instead of the left, and add link on the menu to a page called solutions, and make the logo in the top of the middle of the page and when you scroll down the logo fades away gradually, etc.”\n\nThen it’ll give you all of the code.\n\nI mean if it’s already doing very complex things like making video with humans showing expressions and realistic or magical lifelike environments, then how much longer before it does something as simple as making a website that looks like McKinsey.com? And then a digital agency won’t make like $100k or whatever they would charge McKinsey to design and develop the website.\n\n**edit** for all the angry people - change is consistent in life. If you can’t adapt to change you’ll always be angry and frustrated.\n\nLike why do kids use their darn phones so much?? Back in my day we talked to each other!! Why are there so many pronouns and genders?? Back in my day there was just male and female!! Why did robots displace assembly line workers?? Back in my day the assembly line workers had good stable jobs!! Why are American companies outsourcing labor to India, China, Mexico, etc.?? Back in my day everything was done in America and all Americans had good jobs and they did a good job unlike this cheap Chinese stuff or these terrible Indian call centers and programmers!! Why isn’t America great anymore?? We need to make America great again like it was when I was younger!!\n\nI wish I had bought apple/microsoft/google/amazon/meta/nvidia stock when it was $1… Nobody told me that they would become so valuable and big companies.

        "selftext": "Hi all! TLDR - do super animated, WebGL websites like below actually convert users?\n\n[https://organimo.com/](https://organimo.com/)\n\n[https://stonestyle.co.th/](https://stonestyle.co.th/)\n\n[https://casadisolare.com/](https://casadisolare.com/)\n\nOn Awwwards, I'll often see this type of site as a previous Site Of The Day, but then when I visit, the client will have changed it back to a static version. Makes me wonder if the user conversion numbers fall and they revert. I can guess that these sites aren't SEO friendly or accessible.\n\nWhy I ask - I'm a full stack dev learning ThreeJS and Blender, wanting to get into Creative Development for better job satisfaction (I'm loving it so far!). I'm trying to pin down the use case for these types of sites. The above 3 are highly animated, but I've seen many where there's a subtle animation within a more \"traditional\" design:\n\n[https://resend.com/](https://resend.com/) (3D interactable cube on desktop)\n\n[https://www.makersfund.com/](https://www.makersfund.com/)\n\nAlternatively, I could see a more \"immersive\" design making sense for things like newsletters, presentations, etc that don't require user conversion, like these:\n\n[https://contra.com/freelance-industry-report-2021/](https://contra.com/freelance-industry-report-2021/)\n\n[https://www.pola.co.jp/special/o/wecaremore/mothersday/](https://www.pola.co.jp/special/o/wecaremore/mothersday/)\n\nI've tried to not include websites of creative devs/agencies, as I understand the purpose there.\n\nAs much as I enjoy learning this, I don't want to kid myself into believing there's a relevant job at the end of it if there's no actual demand. So just want to hear the thoughts of actual designers on these types of sites, since I'm just a silly dev person. What you think works, who would actually benefit from having a partly/fully animated site, any insight really. Thanks y'all! - Lev  \nEDIT: spelling + clarity",

It's not a \"team of developers\" and it isn't \"a months work for a senior dev\". Or DevOps. If it is, you're working with the wrong senior dev...\n\n3. There's literally no reason to do this from scratch, that'd be insane, particularly if you're wanting to get something to MVP without spending a bunch of cash. WordPress can do all you need. Login. Register. Listing. Custom taxonomies. Custom fields. SSO with a plugin. There's zero reason to reinvent these wheels - just do it in WordPress. If (and you may not) you need to scale in the future then you could rebuild from scratch, but don't assume you'll need scale right from the off, because you won't. Hosting fees won't be an issue until you hit massive numbers and at that stage you'll have a service worth investing in.\n\n4.

Because there weren't many businesses online, most of the sites were personal sites (and those that weren't likely got updated over time, so no longer show up like...that).\n\nAs part of that monetization comes design languages for different types of sites. For example, if I asked you where the navigation menu on a website is, these days most people would point to the top right then top left corners of the site. Back then, a lot of the navigation bars were on the left side of the page. There's also much more concern for people with disabilities, so much more care is taken to choose primary accent colors that help indicate interactions.\n\nThe technology has also changed *massively*. When I quit my webcomic site in the early 2000s, CSS *didn't exist yet* (talk to me about table layouts). Different browsers used different Javascript compilers. I don't know if you could have users download fonts. And your only option for transparency was gifs. These days CSS and Javascript are ubiquitous. We have Google Fonts (and similar products) that make it incredibly easy to serve that content. And if I want to create an icon (which is a HUGE are of growth in the last couple of years) you can use a png, svg, or even now just a font library.\n\nIIRC, there were also legitimately things you couldn't change about site styling. Like, you couldn't remove the thick-ass border on an iframe, or the underline from a hyperlink. I don't think you could do things change display values, there was no opacity, no filters, no transforms, no gradients, colors were hex- or keyword-only... I could prolly go on, but you get the idea; super limited options.\n\nBasically, tl;dr: these days the technology is massively better, which makes the build process significantly easier, there's also free things like Bootstrap that simplify a lot of design choices, and we've been constantly and collectively improving our design language for websites and standardizing around better best-practices.",

Styles and tastes change.  Same with clothing and hair styles.  Websites designs, even today, are pretty standard to the times.  I aother 10 years, we'll think the way websites looks today is bad/old.\n\n2) Limited bandwidth.  These days a single image on a website can be as big as all the content from 10 (typical) home pages from the early days.  Before 2005, many of your viewers would still be on very slow dialup connections.  Before 2000, basically all of them were.  Speed was often more important than visual design, especially for commercial sites that didn't want you hitting that back button before they fully loaded.\n\n3) Importance.  In the very early days of the web, websites were not seen by many businesses as super important.  This quickly changed, but it did result in the first sites for even multi-million dollar companies to be bland at best.\n\n4) Skill.  Very few people early on had much experience or skill in creating websites.\n\n5) Compatibility.  Especially in the 90's, but even up untl the last 2000s, compatibility among browers was a major issue.  The more complex you made your site, the more likely it was to not work for a certain subset of users.'  If you browsed the web back then you probably remember almost all sites said, \"This site is best viewed with <insert browser name here>\".\n\n6) CSS/Javascript.  CSS and Javascript are two technologies that really allowed website to become what they are today.  However, back in the early days these were not as advanced or as widely supported.\n\n7) Adobe flash, silverlight, java.  No further information needed.\n\nHonestly, this list could probably go on to include many more points.  However, you probably get the idea by now.\n\nSidenote:  One of the interesting things about the web is we went from simple and ugly, then to complex and almost intimidating, to now a return to simplicity but standarized.  This is largely thanks to mobile devices being the main way people consume the web.\n\nI've created many websites over the years and the ones I get the best feedback on are simple but organized websites.  I sort of laugh when businesses spend tens of thousands on websites, and sometimes millions, to make them look fancy.  People are coming for your content, not your design.  As long as the design is easy to navigate, they are happy.  Think about this, how often do you think about how a site looked after you found the content you were after?  You probably only think/care about how fast you were able to obtain that content.",

        "selftext": "I started doing freelance web design work about 2 and half years ago from scratch. Reddit was a huge help along the way. I got a ton of value and have wanted to share what I learned so far in running and managing my business.\n\nBelow are tools and resources that have helped me level up so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Learning To Code**\n\n[W3Schools - HTML & CSS](https://www.w3schools.com)\n\n* Started here and went through both HTML and CSS courses twice. Good foundation. A bit dry in terms of the \"fun\" in the way they teach it.\n\n[Learn to Code HTML & CSS | Shay Howe](https://learn.shayhowe.com)\n\n* A lot more \"fun\" in the way this course is. Really good course for beginners and advanced stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Project Management**\n\n[Trello](http://trello.com)\n\n* Free, works well and many templates to play around with to your liking.\n\n[Asana](http://asana.com)\n\n* Free version and paid version (free is enough for me). I like the interface and due dates. I do my best to keep things simple. This works for me.\n\n[Bascamp](https://basecamp.com)\n\n* Free version and paid. Love the company! Did more than I needed it to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Payment/Invoice Systems**\n\n[Wave](https://www.waveapps.com)\n\n* Free, has invoices, recurring monthly invoices and receipt tracking. It's what I've been using the entire time.\n\n[Fresh Books](https://www.freshbooks.com)\n\n* Paid, lots of features and need to see if the cost is worth it for you. Love the founder and his outlook on business!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Work Agreement / Contracts**\n\n[HelloSign](https://www.hellosign.com)\n\n* Free version and paid version. Allows us to send pdf documents for e-signatures. Sends a professional signal.\n\n[Contract Killer](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/)\n\n* Open-source free contract template. I used this and made it my own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Value Pricing**\n\n[Breaking the Time Barrier](https://www.freshbooks.com/fbstaticprod-uploads/public-website-assets/other/Breaking-the-Time-Barrier.pdf) (book - 1 hr)\n\n* From the founder of Fresh Books. Great book on going from hourly billing to value pricing. Read it a few times. Reminder to read it again.\n\n[Pricing Design Work | Chris Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKXZ7t_RiOE) (video - 37mins)\n\n* Mindset shift to go from hourly billing to value based pricing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sales**\n\n[SPIN Selling Fieldbook](https://www.amazon.com/SPIN-Selling-Fieldbook-Practical-Exercises/dp/0070522359) (book)\n\n* Great book on sales process backed by research. Not manipulative and more based on common sense. We are not for everyone.\n\n[Fox Sales Legend Program](https://foxwebschool.com/fox-sales-legends/)\n\n* Program on sales for web designers. Brings a group of people with the same goal of improving sales together; accountability. There's probably a bunch of programs. This one works for me.\n\n[Fox Web School | YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChpLVuASr1CXYgV6Bqr5rIg/videos?view=0&sort=da&flow=grid)\n\n* Lets you in on how he does things and what works for him. This was helpful for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Education**\n\n[The Freelancers Workshop](https://thefreelancersworkshop.com)\n\n* Part of Seth Godin's Akimbo workshop. Such a game-changer for me! Helped me refine my craft and business as well as connect with a bunch of other professionals around the world. Highly recommend!\n\n[Seth Godin Startup School](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/seth-godins-startup-school/id566985370) (podcast)\n\n* \"Live recording, hear Seth as he guides thirty entrepreneurs through a workshop exploring how they can build and run their dream business.\"\n\n[Rework](https://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745) (book)\n\n* From the founders of Basecamp. Shifted how I view more things than just business; common sense in many ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, that's my brain dump for what's been working for me so far. I'd like to wrap it up by sharing that besides doing the work myself and showing up consistently. The second biggest help has been connecting with others. We don't have to do it alone. Accountability goes a long way!\n\nFYI, each link is an affiliate link. Lol, just kidding :)\n\n\\-\n\nedit: I forgot to mention two great tools recommended by friends the last couple of months that have been a pleasure to use. \n\n[You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (budgeting software)\n\n* Allowed me to have added peace of mind to know where my money was going. I have two budgets (personal and work). I used to use a self-made excel sheet, but then I found YNAB and decided to outsource it.\n\n[1Password](https://1password.com/) (password manager)\n\n* Added security and ease of use to have my passwords all in one place. Took me some time to setup, but now that it's in motion, it's easy.",

I created my first site for a friend of a friend, then they recommended me to her friends. Then their friends started to recommend me. Just that, no social media, no special marketing tricks. I've been very lucky though, especially in this pandemic, as many people don't want a site in this period. If you want to know more let me know..",

I know someone who does 10k/month in recurring SEO. Depends on what you want to learn or outsource.\n\nSales is my toughest challenge. Great advice is always keep something in our pipeline. We should be marketing and looking for our next project while we're finishing our current project, not wait until we're done with it.\n\nReferrals go a long way and having connections like u/MarcoJHB mentioned already. The best method is what works for you. Try out different ones and see where the most traction is, then double down there.",

But overall, to improve it, there would be a few things I would like to note:\n\n1. **You should start with some wireframes first**, this will help you plan out everything better and save you time coding, especially when there are a lot of tools offering you images/ sketches/ text generative AI tools, templates, and the ability to export CSS code from your designs like\n\n* [Figma.com](https://Figma.com) (if you really want to dive into web design)\n* [Visily.ai](https://Visily.ai) (if you want to do some web making but don't have time to learn to design)\n* [Framer.com](https://Framer.com) (this is quite convenient as you can move forward to deploy to their hosting but you won't be able to export or inspect code tho)\n\n**Even sketching on paper/ tablet will do.**  \n\n\n1. **The visual balance**: Right now, the small & medium screen has better visual balance, from the biggest element to the smallest one is somewhat appropriate. But the larger version is just way too off.\n2. Responsive design means that you need to be able to convert your information from small (mobile) to large screens (desktop). The structure of a mobile is, almost all the time, different from a desktop one. But right now, it's not present in your design.\n\nAgain, like the top comment said, this is too early to judge and there would be a lot you can do to improve it. So, keep up the good work mate.",

A UI optimized for mice is simply different than one optimized for mobile/finger.\n\nFor one, more space is typically needed for fingers so that adjacent objects are not mis-selected. This creates too much white space that **wastes screen real-estate**, requiring more scrolling and other extra labor on the part of the user. (Some claim such spacing makes screens easer to read. I disagree, but it would take a while to describe. For one, good use of lines can delineate groupings without hogging lots of space.)\n\nAnd roll-over pop-ups and right-clicking are generally not available to finger-based. One can use cryptic icons if a mouse-rollover can describe them in English. On mobile you are SOL, and should use English instead, taking up space. (Many mobile UI's don't, sticking one with cryptic icons. I hate that! Spanks!)\n\nThere are additional mobile sacrifices I won't go into today. In general, for non-trivial apps/screens/functions, a UI optimized for mice will usually be very different from the *equivalent* optimized for mobile. I stand by this and will accept scenario challenges.",

There were CRUD tools where devs used almost a shorthand to crank out apps at lightning speed. Sufficient responsive UI cannot compete because there are too many variations of display size to consider, arrange, and test. (They had some size responsiveness such as expanding data grids/tables.)\n\nMaybe someday somebody will discover a clean and simple way to do it well and quick, but now it's still glitchy alchemy or requires a Sheldon Cooper UI specialist.",

So, no matter what you do with this client, it is a learning experience for future contracts: always have some limit to the work in the contract with a charge for more work, and demand a final outline with FPO content up front with some charge if they change it meaningfully.\n\nAs for this client: if you can stand to lose them, I'd suggest gently parting ways at the end of your contract. You can revisit the relationship after a few months and see if it can be reset with new terms, but trying to change the relationship without a break is going to cause friction with a client no matter what. If it would be tough but possible for you to lose them, change your next contract to start nudging things in your direction - add some pain (like extra charges) if they keep doing this.\n\nBut, if it's critical for you to keep them happy then you're in a tough position. You have to find some argument for them to change that is more compelling than, \"please do more work so that I am less annoyed with you, but no worries if you don't.\" If you're not willing to use the stick to get them to change, you have to find a meaningful carrot you can dangle in front of them to entice them to do what you want.",

People naturally struggle to envision what the content should be - and to a large extent it’s a fluid problem. I can recommend two things : 1. Partner with writers. You can sell their service which makes your offering stronger and clients happier. 2. Crawl. Walk. Run. Prototype, Iterate. Reduce the vision/scope to something that isnt overwhelming. Sometimes us clients need a nudge to start small and change later. Some of your best clients will be those who are willing (and can afford) a test & learn methodology.\nGood luck!",

                "body": "I feel your pain here - and have gone through this myself. A couple of thoughts here that really helped me:\n\n1.) It sounds like you're already on the right path, the fact that you're even acknowledging that content should inform the design and not the other way around. Lean into this even more. Be obsessive about the clients success. The more you are passionate about their site meeting goals, the more likely they will take getting content seriously. With all of my clients, I talk obsessively about them hitting goals, and using their website as a tool. If they don't have specific goals for their website, then it's not really worth the effort.\n\nIt sounds like you just need to do a slightly better job of selling yourself as a growth-builder more than just a web designer. A growth builder helps a business grow. A web designer \"sounds\" like they only care about aesthetics. If you market yourself as a growth solution, you have more sway to force them into your process. \n\n2.) Clients need to be lead. As another poster mentioned, creating content is HARD. If you are not a copywriter, sitting down and talking about your product, service, or business is challenging. If you can provide them with a framework or guide on what content they need, and how they need to construct it, you will have better results. It might be worthwhile to require that your clients go through the Storybrand framework (or something similar), before the website can be completed.\n\n3.) Bake content development into your process. When you are doing an initial discovery meeting with a client, include content writing as a non-negotiable step to your process. Let them know up front that you will be scheduling a meeting (or several meetings), writing down all of the pieces of content that need made, and actually producing a first draft of said content at these meetings. The content doesn't have to be FINAL... but it at least gives you a good start to design around.\n\nHope this helps! Best of luck.",

The gaming sites back then usually had one main page that allowed for exploration or interaction with a setting that closely resembled a location within game. The websites helped foster a sense curiosity and also world building for the video game, and admittedly, as a kid, I really enjoyed going to those sites and spending hours clicking through everything.\n\nGaming sites now don't really have features like this anymore. Don't get me wrong, there are some really aesthetically looking sites, but it seems like everything has become so standardized. You go into these new gaming sites, and immediately you are hit with a big eye-catching image or video. You scroll down some more, and boom, another image. Rinse and repeat.Here are some examples   \n\n\n(I just thought of 4 random games and looked them up)  \n[Elden Ring](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring)  \n[Legend of Zelda](https://www.zelda.com/)  \n[Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net)  \n[Call of Duty](https://www.callofduty.com)  \nDoes anyone know what happened between the early 2000s to now? Like why did developers and marketers stop these interactive websites? Marketing budgets for these games are huge now, so I don't think money is an issue. Also, does anyone else feel the same way?",

        "selftext": "I'm bidding on a site for one of my wife's business clients.  We are also on friendly terms, he donates to my kids' fundraisers, just a really good guy.  He is a regular graphic design customer for me as well.  I do very few websites, and really only in situations like this where I'm trying to help an existing customer/friend out. That's the setup.\n\nHe is a small chiropractor and has his site with one of those \"Industry-Name\"+\"Websites\"+\".com\" marketing companies that use hideous templates and he feels like he's being overcharged (though he was cagey about what he's paying when I broached the subject).  Every fishing attempt at a \"projected budget\" was met with crickets.  Fair enough.\n\nAnyway, I'm trying to figure out how much the other place probably charged initially and trying to make sure I'm comfortably under that.   I want him to feel like he can come to me for everything.  Is anyone familiar with what those places charge?  From what I gather from some of their blogs, the marketing company tries to target a recurring site hosting/maintenance charge of $250/mo if that helps at all to determine the initial price.\n\nHis website consists of about 8 distinct page designs, and 28 pages total (all pages of certain types use the same layout with different content), including a blog.  All of the content is being rewritten and supplied by a third party copywriter that he hired to run the project for him, so that's less on my plate.  I'm planning to use WordPress.\n\nI did a detailed project breakdown and my initial estimate came to 54 hours total, including allowances for meetings, revisions and 20% project management time on top.\n\nIf I charge my normal design fee of $75/hour, that's $4050.  Does that seem reasonable and substantially lower than what the other place would have charged?\n\nThanks for reading my text wall.  Sorry if this seem insane, but I really don't want to send this guy looking elsewhere.  I have the sole bid at this point and I'd like to keep it that way.",

For example with the extension \"Live Server\" you can just right-click on an HTML-File in the integrated file explorer and select \"open with Live Server\", and it'll open up a browser window with your current file that will automatically be reloaded whenever you change and save a file. So you get a preview in an actual browser, complete with dev tools.\n\nOf course, VS code also has a lot of integrated or downloadable autocomplete fucntions and many other tools that make your live as a web dev much easier.\n\nFor the design part, today we often use prototyping tools like Figma, Sketch or Adobe XD which allows you to create designs for websites and apps which you can use for developing designs with customers without actually having to code the website yet, or just as a reference for yourself. I usually always make a prototype first, even for my private projects, because I find it easier with a reference instead of having to code HTML/CSS blindly.\n\nAlso a tip: If you missed out on it so far, take a look at Sass.

While for just creating designs or references, Illustrator works perfectly fine of course, having scrollable previews with sticky elements, working hamburger-menus and links (that take you to other art boards basically) can be great to give clients a better impression of how the website will look and feel.\n\nA few features of VS Code that I use regularly:\n\nIn an HTML-File:\n\nType `!` (enter) to generate a basic HTML structure with the html, head, and body tags and the most important tags in the head.\n\nType `.classname` (enter) to create a div with that class, or add any element tag before the period to make it that element. For example, `p.myClass` will generate `<p class=\"myClass\"></p>`\n\nAuto-Format and indent files with alt+shift+F\n\nType `lorem10` (enter) to generate 10 words of placeholder text. You can use any number.\n\nThe feature that is generating these snippets is called Emmet and can do even more.\n\nIn CSS/SASS:\n\nWhen using more complex, chained selectors, hover over them to see a preview of how the HTML-structure would have to look like to apply to it.\n\nEspecially here, the auto-complete is very useful, when you start to type, it will start suggesting a list of CSS-properties. After typing a CSS property, it will start suggesting suitable values. That can save pulling up a reference quite a few times.\n\nTalking about references, hover over a CSS property to get a quick description and a link to the MDN reference.\n\nWhen defining a color, it creates a little box that shows that color. Hover over the box and you'll get a color picker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are using Sass, I can also recommend using the BEM naming scheme. BEM is nothing you download or install, it's just a guide on how to name classes to keep your sass files clean. Basically, every section of the website gets a main name, and all elements contained in it get that main name plus a suffix, and because sass can actually combine class names with the `&` operator, that keeps your files clean. I even go as far as creating separate sass files for every component/section of the website, and import all of them into one sass file. Sass will then compile all of it into one file, the one you have imported it into, while making navigation easy for you. No more having to search in a huge file, just click on the file according to the element you want to edit.\n\nIf you start a file name with an underscore, Sass won't compile it unless it is imported somewhere. So by starting all your component file names with an underscore, and then importing them into a style.scss (without an underscore), will make sure Sass will only generate one file containing all your CSS.\n\nThat's probably a lot at once, but I am actually relatively new to web development, and these are some things that my colleagues and I figured out and made our lifes just so much easier.",

Click a playing video: Embiggen.\n3. Stop a video: Hunt for one of two tiny icons.\n\nIf a click starts a video, a click should stop the video. Invisible interactions should be consistent - this magic change of behavior requires a special mental model just for Facebook. It's ridiculous and has to be one of the dumbest major features of a major brand currently in existence.\n\nLike, remember kids! After your cars keys turn on your car, you turn them back to turn on the windshield wipers, but click a button that magically appears on your dash to stop the car ... To help you, we'll play a reminder message across the radio when you turn on the car.\n\nI'm just imagining the product owner specifying this. Some engineer whips up the \"click to play\" and - like a human being who respects the Geneva Convention - implements \"click to stop\". Then there's a giant meeting with everyone in suits except for some kid in a hoodie and they decide that confusing their user base is the right move.\n\nIt has all the hallmarks of a Norman Door:\n\n1. When you \"click to play\" it literally tosses up the text \"Click to Expand\" -  as if this little reminder sitting on top of a playing video is going to be the one magical \"Pull\" label that finally works.\n2. When you \"click to stop\", it does something completely unexpected. In all the years I've been online, I have never wanted to \"click to expand\" a video. It's not even full screen. It's just unexpectedly embiggenated.\n3. You are then presented with the option of hunting for one of two small targets (a close box in the upper left or a tiny pause button) - both of which require mouse acceleration, deceleration, and hunting behavior. Play is 20 milliseconds but stop is 2000 - 4000. Surely that should raise some alarm bells somewhere?\n\nMaybe it's some sort of relic to coordinate with mobile? I don't know. \n\nThe interaction is completely broken.",

        "selftext": "I'm freelancing since 2016. I never studied anything that has anything to do with Web Development or any creative field.\n\nAt first i started making websites for myself (Affiliate Blogs) and earned some money of it. This was about 2008. Then i started to get interested in photography and getting more creative in customizing themes with wordpress. Then a friend asked if i build websites, i said yes, not knowing if i would actually be able to. For the first website i received about 200€. At the time i was still studying, but somehow people kept coming and asking if i could make them a website, every time i didn't know if i would be able to, but was surprised by myself that i could do it, with help of the internet and youtube tutorials of course. As time passed on, people came and asked for different stuff, like can you edit this pictures, can you make this image into a vector, etc. and every time (again, not knowing if i could actually do it) i said yes and so i learned, depending on the project different programs like Adobe Indesign, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Lightroom, After Effects, Premiere Pro, etc. .\n\nWebsite requests got more complicated, shops, booking systems or multilanguage websites had to be made, so again, i got nervous but i got shit done. Every time getting a little more confident in my work i started to wonder if i could make my living with freelance work. So again, i just said yes, and everything kind of worked out. I do have enough projects, but not enough to have kids, and our dream is to have kids.\n\nMy idea is to get a part time job and still do my freelancing on the side. I'm about to start searching for  agencies, but i don't know what i could actually tell them what i do and what i am. Here are some of the things that i have done:\n\n* websites mostly based on Elementor and also Themes\n* I can edit mostly everything with html and css but struggle with php, javascript\n* create mockups for websites\n* Book layout and design (with InDesign) for one book\n* Posters for events (about 5), combination of indesign, illustrator and photoshop\n* Posters and menus for restaurants (indesign, photoshop)\n* Online Marketing (Social Media and Google), not my favorite area\n* Food, Architecture and Product Photography\n* Photo Editing for theatre work, so put the actors face in a painting or money bill, something like that\n* After Effects animations\n* some video editing with premiere pro\n\nThose are just some of the things i have done. I feel like i can do a lot of stuff but i can't do something 100% perfectly. What i enjoy most is talking to clients, listening to what they actually want and then giving them ideas, either with words or with sketches and them making the actual website/menus/posters/etc. I enjoy most of my work but i don't know how i could be someone to start working in an agency in a normal position. If someone is looking for a webdesigner, am i a webdesigner? \n\nI feel like a restaurant that offers everything from pizza to hamburger and then some asian food on the side.",

PHP will get you a wordpress job and is easier to learn. Honestly I'd reach out to some companies and explain your situation, asking what they'd like to see in a future employee. This also gives you a possibility to make early introductions with companies. It sets a different first impression when you're not asking for a job. Keep in touch and ask them if they need any help etc. That way when you do come back for a job, you're not just an applicant because you've crafted a relationship.\n\nI've run a business before so I can advise you better from that side.",

        "author": "ThisDontFeelRight__",
        "id": "f80f4r",
        "selftext": "**TL;DR AT BOTTOM**\n\nHello, I've found myself in a sticky situation and hope to find the right advice here. As a preface, I want to say that I will never work without a contract again, and this has been a learning experience thus far, but I just want this resolved so I can move on with my life.\n\nI am a freelancer and took on a gig via verbal agreement (through WhatsApp, which is our only form of communication) from an old colleague, to do packaging design for a consumable retail product. This project went smoothly, and at the time, he was at the final stages of developing his product, and only needed to buy bags for packaging.\n\nHe then paid me $800 up front (again, via verbal agreement) to create the website for this product, and things started getting sketchy, to the point of me hoping I can drop the project due to not having a contract.\n\nFirst, the timeline of the project was pushed back from the scheduled dates because of trademarking issues, and he actually paid me more to come up with the new name, which, after 2 months (and the website project pending in the meantime) passed the trademark inspection.\n\nWhen he came back to me to resume the website project (3 months past original timeline), new expectations were set on the design. This bugged me, because his new expectations were beyond my ability and not in line with the original (verbally agreed) scope.\n\nWe struggled about it, and he ended up outsourcing a developer to copy a competitor's site exactly, which would leave me the task of just inputting his own brand content/info. I was against this ethically and this should've been the first red flag, but at this point, I was happy to get some of the work off my hands and push this toward completion so I can get out of it.\n\nBut since he came back to resume the project, more red flags began popping up.\n\nAs I tried to produce the content for the website, I'd ask him questions about the product, and he would suggest using fake testimonials.\n\nWhen I asked why, he would reveal to me that the product is untested in its final form because he hasn't finished perfecting the manufacturing of it.\n\nHe hasn't ordered packaging, so we can't produce any visuals based on the product beyond my initial mockup during the packaging design project.\n\nDespite having no legal licensing of this consumable product (Department of Health, FDA, selling permits, etc.), he claims to have multiple establishments and clients ready to distribute/buy the product.\n\nWait, what? Something wasn't adding up. I have experience in retail consumable goods, and nothing here sounds right. So this guy wants to market a product that isn't even finished or legally up to code, wants me to put false promises on his website, and is guaranteeing me that I will be rewarded once the brand blows up?\n\nThis is just textbook snake oil bullshit.\n\nSo I Googled his name, and found evidence dating back to 2007 of him hopping digital industries and scamming/hacking until he gets black balled, primarily from multiple forum posts exposing his shady dealings to a whole industry's network. One forum thread even had evidence of sending violent threats to colleagues.\n\nI don't want to continue creating work for what seems like a scam product, and frankly feel abused because there has been a handful of conflict throughout the project about my ability to execute the things he wants.\n\nSo, I want to know what kid of legal action he can take against me if I just dropped this project and kept the $800, because that money is long gone. I can't ghost him, because he knows me and we are actually \"friends.\"\n\nIf there's some way I can negotiate my way out of this situation without finishing the fake content production/website design (which is supposed to be due on Monday 2/24, with a draft due by tomorrow, Sunday 2/23), any advice on what my options are would be GREATLY appreciated.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* All project terms/scopes are agreed verbally via WhatsApp, no contract\n* Guy hired me to do branding/packaging for a consumable retail product, went fine\n* Paid me $800 up front to make website\n* Timeline pushed back months, and scope of design expectations changed once resumed\n* Once I begin the project, red flags are raised about the validity/legality of the product and his promises of retail success, having people ready to buy, and having stores ready to distribute\n* Feeling abused as a contractor and sensing sketchiness, I research the client and find a history of scamming/hacking in multiple industries between 2007-2012, namely an exposé in a 6-page forum thread in his former industry that included his threats of violence to colleagues\n* Want to leave the project, but don't have $800 to refund, plus I already put in hours of work and free brand consulting\n* Need to know my options considering any legal risk\n* Cannot just ghost due to him knowing me and would rather part with an explanation",

        "author": "flyingbyson",
        "id": "fi2ltp",
        "selftext": "TLDR; Probably best not to worry about this question ;p\n\nSo I've been working on a kids' website for a while now, and part of my idea was to have just some fun facts & information for kids. I initially wanted to have categories where each category would be a different branch of science, however...\n\n* The branches of science are not exactly mutually exclusive (i.e. entomology is a branch of zoology)\n* Kids generally don't search Google for \"Zoology facts.\" They are much more likely to search for \"animal facts\"\n\nUp to this point I've had all of the ~~tiles~~ cards labeled with their branch of science in the larger font below and a descriptor above. But I've been considering changing it so that more recognizable fields remain as is, while the others are changed (i.e. \"chemistry\" and \"physics\" will stay the same, while \"zoology\" will become \"animals\" in the larger font--and \"zoology\" in the smaller font) so that they're more identifiable for kids and more specific. This would also impact the URLs of the pages--i.e. [site.com/zoology/elephants](https://site.com/zoology/elephants) would become [site.com/animals/elephants](https://site.com/animals/elephants) while [site.com/physics/gravity](https://site.com/physics/gravity) would stay the same.\n\nAnyway, I know I'm probably overthinking this, but I was wondering if this would be kind of a weird thing to do. #1, it kind of would imply to the kids that \"zoology\" is too complicated of a term for them, and #2 it just seems inconsistent. Also... as a #3, for some categories, like paleontology, I wouldn't be sure whether to keep it as-is or to change it. I know this is super random and a dumb, rambly question, but if anyone has any advice or suggestions I'd greatly appreciate it :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3trspb8zvgm41.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=a15686a34f1741d21b19e2468b833fe197719878",

Basically, the way I have it now is that each upper heading (except for the scientists one, it's kind of a hack) is a descriptor of the category, rather than one being a subcategory of the other. I decided to do this when I realized that kids might not know what fields like \"mycology\" are (the descriptor is \"mushrooms and fungi,\" but now I'm thinking that even this isn't quite accessible enough.\n\nThough, I hear what you're saying and, rats, now I'm thinking that's where I should be planning on ending up since realistically it makes the most sense overall... I don't know if I can produce the content to fill that many categories/branches at the moment, and man it took so long just to get this design knocked out. I think the problem I'm having is that I haven't clearly defined how I want the hierarchy to look--this is also a problem I'm having with the overall site structure. Ugh lots to think about now I guess haha.\n\nAnyhoo, thank you for taking the time to read my post and write such a detailed answer. Much, much appreciated :)",

How much would you pay for it?\n\nI perfectly understand that developing a CMS with pure code from scratch is quite difficult and takes a lot of time (possibly even more than a month), since I have coded my own CMS lately. But I am still curious, just conducting some small market research here.\n\nDo you find that service of any value and what's a reasonable price, you would spend for a decent, custom to your needs, CMS platform.\n\nDecent meaning: You can update and edit certain sections of the website without code. Database to store data,  User Authentication, Dashboard with website & page info, posts, views, likes, analytics and statistics, geographical user data. Blog-post editor, users board, settings. You can have schedule posts. etc.\n\nEdit: A website builder and CMS are different things. In this case, I am not talking about building websites with a CMS, just modify the content with it. Platforms like WordPress are CMS & Website builders. The idea here is: you hire someone to build you a website, and on top of it they build you a dashboard to control the content in your uniquely designed website. The architecture, structure, layout of the website will never change. You will only be able to modify the content presented on certain parts, see analytics and other stuff. No building.",

It's much easier to take something crappy and figure out how to make it work for you than starting with a blank page. Also, most answers of AI are completely stupid. You have to go back and forth with it till it gives you something you can utilize. You must spend a lot of time with it.

        "selftext": "I have tried all platforms but nothing is working for me. Quick rundown of my client sources:\nGot all my clients so far from Indian startup subreddits. The only issue being that Indian clients, especially at the startup stages are less paying than the normal market standards. My first ever client which I got from an Indian startup subreddit was for a meagre 25 USD. I'm not complaining as I had only 2-3 sites on my portfolio at that time, and he did give me referral to a client from which I charged around 40 USD. These offered me a good stepping stones for my next client (charged around 95 usd) and now I'm charging over 100 dollars and got immensely better at this thing. But because of my \"high\" rates in the Indian ecosystems, I have very few frequency of the clients coming in and also some do not end up publishing the site because the tech stack that I use i.e Framer, costs monthly plans which are sometimes unaffordable for my clients. I have decided to skip Indian clients and focus on international clients.\nTried Fiverr and Upwork, but the hyper competitive landscape there is killing me. I apply to a job every month on upwork through the monthly free connects that I get, but I manage to get no responses so far. I do think that my portfolio is decent and the websites I make are also pretty decent looking but ofcourse, I strive to make it better and upskill myself. I also tried cold emailing a few companies with their website revamps but got no reply. I also find this process to be unproductive as you're spending your time for revamping someone's website who might not need a revamp for a bunch of reasons, also it's unnecessary expenditure for them as most people think in the terms of \"it's okay as long as it's functioning\" and give lesser regards to design and ux. It's also hard to determine what they actually need or what their vision with the website is without even talking to them. Plus it's also difficult to determine if they would be willing to change their current tech stack.\nI have tried several different ways to find clients but have been unsuccessful in a lot of them so far.\n\nSo how and where do I actually find clients?",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow developers,\n\nI’ve been working with Astro for creating websites and love its performance benefits and DX. However, I'm facing challenges with the client handoff process, especially when compared to more integrated platforms like Webflow, Framer, or WordPress.\n\n**Here’s the scenario:** When building websites with platforms like WordPress, Webflow,  etc., the handoff is straightforward — I simply transfer the project to the client's account, and they have everything in one place to manage and make updates as needed. **HOWEVER**, with Astro and most likely other modern frameworks, the process seems fragmented and potentially overwhelming for clients, especially small to medium-sized businesses.\n\nFor instance, to fully hand over a project:\n\n* Clients need a GitHub account for version control.\n* A Netlify/Vercel account for hosting.\n* An account for where the self-hosted CMS is (I am considering options like Directus or Payload to avoid monthly fees for my clients).\n* An account for the CMS itself to log in and make changes to the website.\n\nThis setup feels complex, particularly for clients who prefer owning their site without ongoing maintenance fees. They may find managing multiple accounts and interfaces daunting.\n\n**My questions to the community are:**\n\n1. Have you encountered similar challenges with modern frameworks like Astro?\n2. How do you simplify the handoff process while maintaining the autonomy and cost-effectiveness that clients desire?\n3. Are there tools or strategies that can integrate these services more seamlessly?\n4. If you've implemented custom solutions or found effective workarounds, could you share your experiences?\n\nAny insights, experiences, or advice on managing client handoffs in this context would be greatly appreciated. I'm particularly interested in solutions that could apply not only to Astro but also to other modern front-end frameworks facing similar issues.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

This is new, so I haven't gotten update requests yet. (Even when they pay for WordPress integration, they don't tend to update their site much. Lol.) I plan to take care of update requests with a day rate.",

Putting an entire CMS and some other back system for a site. A client maybe is going to change one or two times a year. It's just more work than necessary, and it also means security risks as time goes.\n\nLet's face it, somebody could set up a WordPress site for a client and hand it off and be done with it, then. The client is barely touching it, but also not updating the back end when those updates pop up, and then all of a sudden you get a call a year later that their entire site got hacked and the client is angry.\n\nThe only time I ever recommend any CMS is when I know the client needs to change their content regularly. Maybe they are blogging, maybe they are doing e-commerce, or something. On top of that, I try to think about a system that this client can use. I've seen so many people set up these WordPress sites that are so complicated with plugins and other things to make the content happen, and then the client is basically bewildered on what they're supposed to do when they want to make a little change.\n\nIt's great we have all these wonderful systems out there, but I often feel in the end the web designer building something for a small or medium-sized business has to think about the end user and how they are going to be able to maintain this site. If that means you can't do every little thing you would love to do, then that's life. The big robust amazing looking websites usually have dedicated people taking care of them.",

That means you are stuck with whatever design that comes from the author who created the theme. It might also come with bloated free plugins included from  the theme work just to work. \n\nThe second solution is using the modern WordPress native solution which is called full site editing. As the name says. You build your whole website on your edit. \n\nI haven't personally player around so much with it, but based on I have read on the internet, it's a bit Janky and not working as expected. It's kinda early release you could say. \n\nThe third solution is to use native WordPress Gutenberg blocks. The Gutenberg blocks is not intended to look 100% in the back end (where you edit your pages and posts) as in front end (when you publish your posts/pages) pixel perfect, but rather proof of concept which is fine. The Gutenberg Block had been around quite some time and its stable vs the full site editing which is not. You can always try and download different third party Gutenberg blocks to play around and see how it goes. Just be aware those blocks are \"generic\", so you won't get a custom/specialized block based on your needs. That requires you need to develop your own blocks, but you can overwrite the block CSS though. \n\nThe fourth solution is to use page builders such elementor, divi builder, oxygen whatever exist out there. It's not native Gutenberg blocks or full site editing, but rather their own solution that kinda have the same functionality as the Gutenberg blocks and full site Editing you could say. \n\nThe fifth solution is an old school approach where you use something called advanced custom fields where you can create custom fields and custom templates to arrange your website where you can build your own website, but It's not very intuitive to use if you aren't the person who developed the solution. \n\nPlugins or themes is required to install in order to use Elementor for example. For the native WordPress solutions, you don't need to install anything unless you want to use some kind third party Gutenberg blocks.\n\nEdit: this might be overwhelming with lots of options to choose. If you want the easiest solution, then I recommend either use Elementor or Gutenberg Blocks",

There is nothing you can’t do with relative ease and you have total control. Bricks is really designed for developers to deliver a product to a client.\n\nAny website you see from large resource hubs to small business websites, to blogs, to fancy looking Awwwards websites (mostly done using Webflow), I can do with Bricks and MotionPage (gsap) in a fraction of the time of starting from scratch, and the site will smoke 95% of the internet on Google Pagespeed/Gtmetrix (properly optimized on a good host, of course).\n\nI started writing code when I was 15. I’m 41 now… that puts me at 26 years like you.\n\nIm certainly a bit of a curmudgeon self-taught old school dev, but im more happy with my current stack than I’ve ever been (even a bit inspired), and my clients are happier than ever too.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI've been doing some research to find the best platform to build a small business website that will be self-hosted for myself. But I'm having trouble finding the best solution and would like to hear some opinions from people who have compared some of the solutions. Some options I'm evaluating are 1) Hugo, 2) Jekyll, 3) Grav, 4) Ghost.\n\nI refuse to use wordpress because of security issues (they are by far the biggest target and I see on my cloudflare page attempts to exploit security holes from wordpress everyday).\n\n\nWhich one of the ones above do people recommend? Here are the things I need:\n\n***1) User management on backend + frontend login page*** (my small business will require clients to login to a page where they will have customized content tailored to them, e.g. their quarterly invoice, statements, etc).\n\n***2) Simple form to contact me*** (that's ideally hardened somewhat against spammers)\n\n***3) Ability for my assistant who is not technically capable to use a simple web interface to upload documents*** like invoices for each of the clients quarterly for the clients to download. Rest of the website will remain pretty static so no need for a fancy WYSIWIG editor since I'm technically capable and have working knowledge of HTML/CSS (but nice to have nontheless if I need to make quick edits).\n\n***4) The CMS/SSG also generates iOS/Android compatible mobile websites*** so that if someone browses the website on mobile, they can login and see the same theme.\n\n***5) Has a decent collection of off the shelf, ready made company websites*** I can work off of. I don't mind using a blog template or something and customizing it to look more like a company website if that's easy to do.\n\n***6) Free, but willing to pay a little to buy a decent theme if needed or for certain modules on a one-time basis***\n\n\nWhich of the CMS/SSGs I mentioned above best fits these requirements?",

In this age of wanting to give back generously, I figured I’d take my notes from my bootcamp and compile a quick guide and a few shorthand rules for all of you with Hoop Dreams™. I’ve also taken the liberty of editing those notes into a Q & A format for easy reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Game Portfolio Design, Structure and Standards\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What’s the bare minimum I need to start applying as a game UI UX Designer?\n\n**A:** The 3 keys to the kingdom are: Marketable Projects, A Portfolio to showcase those Projects, and a Resume.\n\nMarketable Projects are the obvious must-haves to start applying, and their quality and relevancy will be *the* overriding factor in folding you in. Notice I said marketable: tonally and artistically relevant to The Company you’re applying to. We’ll talk about that a little later.\n\nYou’ll also need a way to showcase your designs to The Company. A website all your own is an expense, to be sure, but it’s also an incredible platform for any modern Designer to build upon… if your bank account allows.\n\nA Resume is an ancient holdover from the Old World, used to progress through online applications (barely more than a truckstop bathroom key at this point).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** How big should I make my game UI UX Portfolio?\n\n**A:** I always recommend 6-12 pieces with 4-6 media apiece; media meaning a potpourri of final art, icon arrays, sketches, wireframes, video - anything that *enshrines* your designs and provides authentic proof of a process. I also recommend a paragraph or two for project details and a sentence for project duties (conceptualization, wireframing, iconography, art assets, implementation through Unity/Unreal/Scaleform, etc.).\n\nIf this all sounds remarkably lean (but muh War & Peace-long case studies!) it’s supposed to be. Think about it from our perspective: no Art Director is there to hire a writer, and we’ll leapfrog to your images out of necessity or frustration; and you’d better design around the former to stave-off the latter. The dirty truth is most Art Directors have made up their minds about your skills by the time your website loads. No need to belabor the point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q**: Will non-game related Projects hurt my chances at a game Company?\n\n**A**: Just make sure there is enough variety in your portfolio for a team to make a judgement call on your shapeshifting abilities. My portfolio that got me into Midway Games was more about the presentation of my Projects, less the Projects themselves, but it worked. My Portfolio that got me into EA and id Software was much more elaborate and stylized, but still showcased a menagerie of work, not just game art - and that seemed to work too.\n\nIrrelevancy won’t hurt their opinion of you, because the idea of your chances being bent by tangential work don’t really exist. You can make a Lovecraftian portfolio that screams, “I’m unhirable, ahhh!” - absolutely. But you can also do everything right and still not get the call. My little Loves, that’s called *life*.\n\nThe truth is that a game company will hire you for one of two reasons. Either your work is hauntingly similar to the project they’re working on now - or they’re looking for a strong generalist with a kaleidoscopic body of work. That being said, your ability to work print, corporate design and websites is incidental to your ability to create game wireframes, game artwork, and implement in a popular engine. Or simply put, make sure the beer you’re pouring isn’t all foam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Applying and Interviewing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What does the UI UX Design interview process at a Game Company look like?\n\n**A:** Abandon all Hope, ye who enter here. There are 4 Gates before the burning Hells: The Frontliner, The Art Director, The Test and finally The Team.\n\nThe Frontliner can be any number of people: a recruiter, associate producer, outsource manager - their job is to vet if you’re crazy or a liar at a very early stage, as well as field details like salary expectations (you do have an answer for this, right?).\n\nThe Second Harrowing is the Art Director who will ask you far more salient questions - mostly about process and past experiences. These are generally soft-ball questions, as most game Art Directors do not specialize in UI UX Design. Unless your process is ruinously bad, you’re likely off to the next round because it’s the only part that counts in the eyes of The Company: The Test.\n\nThe Third Labor is the bane of all creatives great and small: the Art Test. Art Tests come in a rainbow-variety of forms and intensities. My Art Test for id Software was a week long and I got marauded by the flu by day 2. Got food poisoning during the interview, too - the point is, love it or loathe it, the Art Test is yet another potent way to vet if you’re crazy or a liar... and to see if your portfolio pieces are actually yours.\n\nIf you ice out anywhere, it will be after the Art Test.\n\nThe Fourth and Final Hell is… really perfunctory, to be honest. The last thing you’ll do is talk to the game team (or the small Strike Force you’ll be a part of). This is mostly to see if you and the team can acclimate for 30 minutes without somebody getting… oh, let’s call it *political*.\n\nBarring sudden-onset Tourette's, if you’re meeting with the team, it’s nothing but daylight between you and gainful nerdployment. (Though I do personally have a 1st-hand account of one gentleman who accepted a game job offer, quit our Company, moved out of his apartment and had the new Company immediately dissolve the position while the ink was still fresh and it STILL makes me laugh.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q**: It’s been a few days since I applied. How long should I wait before I move on?\n\n**A:** A week and some change. Game companies are flooded with applications all the time, the majority of which are of a… burgeoning... level of talent. When a Company receives a prospect even remotely qualified, they’ll move on it. Far too much money is at stake to wait for a Super-duper Senior when a whatever-level Designer will do.\n\nOh, and when a Company lists the job as remote-friendly but they want you to move eventually? That means they’re *only* hiring local. It’s a bold-ass, brazen-ass lie.\n\nFor your own sanity, you should gently ping The Company on the status of your application, if only to get a definitive no and move on psychologically. But if they want you, they won’t let a little thing like five workdays stop them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** I’m not even making it into the first round of talks with a Company! What am I doing wrong?\n\n**A:** Not going to lie to you, and I say this with all the gentle R&B-style love in the world: it’s all your ugly-ass projects; **they ugly!** Now, as soul-crushing as that is to hear, there are a few subtle differences between all-ugly and *mostly-ugly.*\n\nFirst, is your work modern? Can I see a blending of trends and modular improvements Industry-wide in your work? Do you know concepts like Masonry Menus, Faux-mouse interactions, and opt-in information design? Are you throwing bizarre web 1.0 photoshop filters over panels and adding glows everywhere? You don’t have to be as breathtakingly polished as the screens you drool over on Pinterest, but you know... act like you belong.\n\nSecondly, are you secretly showcasing that you’re actually a terrible engineer? An Art Director might not have an encyclopedic knowledge of what makes UX work, but they will have a jaw-dropping knowledge of technical game development. If they’re reminded of something functionally wrong, confusing, or in error (no button prompts, no back buttons, no highlight states, etc.) it sends a clear message *you’ve only been making Portfolio pieces and have* no *practical follow-through worth risking a project on*.\n\nLastly, the medium is the message. You are a part of a truly bizarre field where the presentation of information is slightly more important than the data itself. If you were a fashion designer, you better believe you wouldn’t rock acid wash jeans and an Nvidia shirt when applying to Banana Republic (apropos of nothing, my work portfolio shows nothing but blank thumbnails right now).\n\nAs a UI UX Designer in games, how you present yourself is a reflection of how you’ll present “their baby”. In this way, your Portfolio is the hidden, last Project, and, paradoxically, the first impression they will ever glimpse of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Networking, Skills and Growth\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** How should I network as a very Junior UI UX designer for games?\n\n**A:** Slowly. Networking is gardening: exceptionally few initial results with lots of maintenance which eventually blossoms into a plentiful harvest (that makes the initial investment *finally* worth it). The goal isn’t to amass the greatest numbers of followers, likes or resends. The goal is to be in front of a few people who will open doors, build bridges and otherwise sculpt the future with you.\n\nAn easy win for a new Designer is to network with other new Designers at around your skill level. You should also have treehouse-like interactions with other Creatives vying for the game industry but not in your specific field: concept, 3D, props, etc. Working on amateur projects with a real (albeit amateur) team is an amazing way to learn on-the-job skills and to imprint yourself on soon-to-be besties. Eventually your contacts will rise through the ranks, and one of them will take the rest of their friends with them on their meteoric rise. You should be that friend, if you can not flatly be that meteoric riser yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** Should I have a LinkedIn Profile?\n\n**A:** Oh my fu- YES! 3 of the 4 in-house jobs I’ve had (EA, id Software, Glu Mobile) were all the result of some wayfaring Recruiter on LinkedIn. Those were just the job offers that I took, there were dozens more because game UI UX Designers are ludicrously difficult to recruit. If you make it into the Industry, you are staffed like a unicorn; a triple-horned albino unicorn if you can evolve into a Senior. Why make it harder for people to give you a new job title and a 25% raise? In the words of the poet-laureate Tim Heidecker, “Psst… it’s free real estate.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What’s the best way to boost my skills while I wait?\n\n**A:** Make tons of personal projects. This is the method I used to build up my skills and portfolio, back in the 2000’s when we thought you had to save the life of a game designer to become one. Deconstruct okay-ish game screens you know and redesign them slightly better (or at least functionally different). Take an intellectual property that has no game and try to make one, capturing its mood and tone. Grab Unity or Unreal and learn implementation at the same time. Blog about your experiences - see one, do one, teach one. No matter what, just refuse to sit still and your skills will rise ambiently. Having them rise exponentially is… trickier (see: Mentorship below).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What books can I read to improve my UI UX skills specifically for game design?\n\n**A**: Nothing! Not a god-damn thing! There’s virtually nothing out there by way of standards, practices or process for formal video game interface design (aside from the material I’m writing since very few are volunteering). Naturally, there are resources on generic, over-the-counter UI UX Design for apps and websites. But those are blunted, padded affairs compared to the zero-point-of-failure *lethality* of video game development.\n\nIn fact, I would argue vanilla UI UX Design is like flying a cargo plane. Game UI UX is like flying an F-14 Tomcat. Maverick could *definitely* fly a cargo plane and keep it steady for hours. I seriously doubt a cargo plane pilot could hop into an F-14 and somehow just *make it happen.* Some skills translate - but not nearly enough to make you competitive, and definitely not enough to get your ass into Top Gun.\n\nGame UI UX Design is its own intense, unique thing. You absolutely must treat it as such.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What classes can I take to improve my skills?\n\n**A:** I haven’t taken any personally, and as such, I can’t in good conscience vouch for them. All my training is either self-taught or on-the-job… and that totally worked for me.\n\nThat being said, your time would be infinitely better spent with 1-on-1 over-the-shoulder mentorship than with something cold and distant - especially *these* days. Nobody is working under ideal circumstances anymore so, dear God, don’t go out in the middle of the eel-infested waters and try to do this alone. Get a damn swim-partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What kind of 1-on1 Mentorships can I take to improve my UI UX game design skills\n\n**A:** Okay now we’re talking. I broke into the game’s Industry through focus, commitment and sheer (lucking) will. But I would have much rather flourished with a warm and nurturing guide by my side. I would’ve adored some tapestry of, “No, not that red, try the maroon - it doesn’t clash with the navy background. Why not get rid of those three buttons on the side and fit them under one menu button? Your font has these razor thin lines, see? That’s going to disappear on mobile - big mistake.”\n\nFrankly, that would’ve been amazing.\n\nSo I highly recommend, in the absence of any real material on the subject, to learn from the people who are internalizing and redefining those materials every day. Grab a mentor and commit to a few months of lightspeed study. Come with project ideas, Industry questions and what you consider your own weaknesses. Independent mentors (cough cough) tend to be better in quality since they’re working professionals teaching practical skills for the love of the game, but larger mentorship programs (Springboard, IDF, RookieUp, etc.) are also chocked full of warm, generous people, too.\n\nIn the end, your Time is the only resource you will never, *ever* get back. A Mentorship, at its core, is a DeLorean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for making it *this* far in what hopefully hit the balance between a Cracked.com article and a TED talk. Like I said up top, nobody’s been writing about any of these things recently, so I’m doing my best. If you have a subject on the Industry you’d like to know more about, let me know. Love to hear what you all think. Stay safe and stay inspired.\n\n\\-John “[The Wingless](https://www.thewingless.com/)” Burnett",

This also apply to every industry, but that doesn't negate the demand for certain skills under certain contexts.\n\nIf you think a triple A game wants to exclude people with color blindness from playing their game (or other disabilities), then they are rejecting a lot of potential revenue, as well as leaving a player base with disabilities out in the cold.\n\nEvery industry have companies that are bloated with excessive resources, that doesn't mean UX/UI designers isn't important in a lot of video game projects.

        "selftext": "Apologies if this question doesn't belong, but it seems ok from what I've read so far.\n\nI'm quitting the tech industry to open my own brand and web design studio. I'm a visual designer of about 10 years, turned UX designer about 4 years ago. One of my referrals sounds pretty easy: making small changes to their website by moving a photo of the new owner to the top of the company's \"about me\" page. I've worked with enough content management systems to figure this out, but she might need more intensive web development next year. My skills definitely lean more towards the design side, but I have done a number of web edits and CMS training over the years at other jobs. Their site looks like it's only 6 pages and I could easily contract out some assistance from other devs if I really need to. I'm hoping to offer web development through Webflow, Wordpress, and Shopify down the road once I get reacquaint myself with those platforms, so this seems like a good opportunity.\n\nI'm thinking to charge $75/hour for basic site changes since that seems to be a pretty common average number. Does that sound reasonable? I'm in the Seattle area.\n\nAnd for pricing larger projects like an entire website, I know the general rule of thumb is to price based on how long you think it would take to complete the work. My secret hourly rate for design/web/UX work is about $160/hour, but I'm a bit unsure how long it would take me to create a 6 page website. My plan so far is to create some other fake projects to get experience.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: thanks for the silver! <3  \nEdit edit: SHE SAID YES TO THE WEB EDITS!! We're going to talk more about the website when it gets closer to end of Q2 next year. :)",

The part that might be unrealistic is if there's a gap between how long it takes you and how much someone expects to pay. If the task of \"moving a photo to the top of the page\" takes you four hours ($300) and is worth $50 to your client then you have a problem.\n\nWhen you say\n\n>I know the general rule of thumb is to price based on how long you think it would take to complete the work\n\nI get really worried that you don't have any experience scoping projects. Stick with hourly until you have a better sense of how long it takes to do the work and what might potentially go wrong along the way.\n\nThe \"secret hourly rate\" happens when you figure out how to charge more for work that takes you less time. Sometimes people call this \"value billing\" — I don't love that phrase. But billing a fixed fee for a fixed amount of work can definitely be more lucrative than billing hourly if you know what you're doing.",

Technically, there are other version control systems... but you basically just want git. In broad strokes, it's like a second save step: You work on a file, you save it to your computer, and then you save it to the git repository where it becomes the new current version. Your colleagues can then say, \"Give me the latest\" and all their files update accordingly, allowing them to continue working and stay in sync.\n\nIt's most common to use git with a centralized hosting service which everyone can then connect to. [Github](https://github.com/) is the most popular, followed by [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/), and others.\n\nIt's intimidating, but ultimately one of the most useful skills you can pick up while doing this work. There are many different ways to use it, generally called workflows. Just keep in mind that industry standards are recommendations for large, experienced teams and seem unlikely to be the right fit for a group just starting out.",

Basically, is it possible to get their login for their godaddy domain then make it into a wordpress site (since this is what I am most familiar with)? or is that the wrong approach?\n\n100% tell me if I am approaching this wrong. I can do the design but the logistics of actually being able to edit their existing site are a little lost on me!\n\nThank you for reading through my stress, I am grateful for any advice.

Our core product is a collaborative relationship management too that can be used independently or integrated into existing CRMs. You can create a database and store records and properties. Within each record you can collaborate with teammates in real time to build stronger relationships. We're planning to really super charge this area to stream line workflows. \n\nWe use it heavily to manage our customers instead of making a Slack channel for each customer. \n\nIt's just - we don't really know how to explain it in a way that resonates with people. We have users and we’ve had a chat with them but would also love some outside eyes.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions. Please let us know!",

                "body": "There are a few broad categories and you can pick the right choice for your, based upon expense, flexibility, ease of use, and your comfort with DIY. In broad strokes, you probably want some kind of a Content Management System (or CMS) that lets you focus on writing your content and handles the display of that content for you, based off your settings and choices.\n\nSquarespace is an example of a _hosted service_. They handle all the technical details and let you pick and choose what you want to write and how it's presented. You're limited by what they offer - and have no real ability to change it - but what they offer often happens to be pretty good for a lot of folks. Other examples are wix and wordpress.com (note the \".com\" part). Squarespace tends to be on the expensive end, but folks really seem to like using it.\n\nA little more DIY is _running your own blog_ on a hosting service. This can take a few different forms, but generally involves a very similar authoring experience, but with a corresponding increase in control over the site and responsibility to keep it running. It's often cheaper in terms of dollars, but with a lot more time involved. Also, you get to learn more about how things work. Wordpress is the largest for blogging in particular, but Ghost worth looking at, and you can also look at something like Jekyll, which reduces some of the maintenance but can require a bit of coding.\n\nLastly, you can _just create plain old html_. This is essentially free in terms of cost and infinitely flexible, but takes _a lot_ more time for most people's expectations. It also gives you the most opportunity to learn how things work. That's probably more DIY than you want from your description, but worth mentioning.\n\nIt's worth looking into all three a bit - and there are infinite variations of those three categories, as I'm sure others will point out - and figuring out works for you based upon your desire to write versus your desire to learn to build a website. There's no wrong answer!",

I figured familiarizing myself with html5 would be a good start.\n\nAlso is there a type of computer you would suggest having that is better for the design aspect? I have a 5 year old MSI gaming laptop that works okay but doesn't have a great screen. My girlfriend has a surface pro laptop and the touch screen interface seems like it would be very beneficial to have for design.",

So some albums would still be albums, but they won't be displayed in the Albums menubar if that makes sense. Unfortunately the system doesn't allow for this functionality so I am creating a custom Albums menu item that would exclude those specific albums (something that I am doing through a menu plugin). But I quite like the design feature that when you are in an album's page the album's link becomes bold in the Albums menubar. It just doesn't work with my custom album. However, I can add JS and other things to the custom menu's code, which I think might be the way to go for me, as PHP and Smarty seem to be quite complicated.

My goal is to offer a platform where customers can subscribe and gain access to a range of digital products.\n\nI'm looking for recommendations on online platforms or tools that are particularly suited for creating a subscription-based ecommerce store. Ideally, these platforms should offer:\n\n1. **Ease of Use:** User-friendly interface for both the administrator and customers.\n2. **Customization Options:** Ability to tailor the platform to fit specific needs.\n3. **Integration Capabilities:** Seamless integration with other tools for payment processing, customer management, etc.\n4. **Scalability:** Able to support the growth of the business.\n\nIf you've had experience building or managing a similar type of e-commerce store, I would greatly appreciate your insights. What platforms have you used or come across that might fit these criteria? Any tips on what to look for or potential pitfalls to avoid would also be immensely helpful.\n\nThank you in advance for your suggestions and advice!",

Really small company, very mis-managed, I had to occasionally work as a project manager. I had a fun variety of work but no designer above me, and I was entry level so my non-designer boss would straight up just grab my mouse and change things to actively make my designs worse when he didn't like them. Also was way underpaid. Stayed there about 3 years.\n\nSecond job was predominantly web design, but I had more of a print background than most so I would occasionally help out on that end. Company was run really well, boss was incredibly supportive and most people I worked with were great. Unfortunately the subject matter was excruciatingly boring to the point where it was bad for my mental health - basically created a cycle of me not caring, having to force myself to do work, knowing it wasn't my best work because I didn't care, trying to force myself to do better and then feeling like I couldn't make a difference because our platform didn't allow for a lot of change or testing. Stayed there for 5 years. \n\nNow onto my third and current job... back to super creative work, smaller company but big enough that I can take time off without feeling guilty. Was supposed to have a senior title coming in and a lot more of an overall design focus including both web and print, but their needs changed and now I'm a web designer/dev again. It's a lot more dev focused and a lot less design focused even though I was supposed to be designing a lot more than I am. Have my boss telling me my work is great, but one of the other bosses is seemingly never happy with my design work and seems like I'm never doing enough on the dev front for him even though I'm teaching myself new skills on a practically weekly basis. Came in on false promises that promotion would be possible, now very aware that it probably isn't. Feeling super defeated. Also, we REALLY need a project manager and it's causing so many problems that we don't have one.\n\nI hate always having to feel like a mind reader when doing work, I hate never feeling like I get a solid win in, I hate wanting to be engaged with my work and then being too invested as a result. I hate how I feel like I need to do something creative to not have my soul sucked out of me 40 hours a week, and then feeling so crappy and uncertain of what I'm doing with my life as a result. \n\nDoes anyone have a job where they feel like things are well organized, people are consistently happy with the work they're doing, and they actually feel fulfilled? This industry feels so inconsistent and so unorganized and after about 9 years I'm not sure I'm cut out for it anymore. \n\nThanks for letting me vent and I'd love to hear if anyone can relate or has any advice.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI want to start a simple little blog to record timestamped content, pretty much just text and images. However, I want to have a bit of control over the content. Now, it's been a long time since I've done anything in html and my knowledge of mathematics behind cryptography has rusted from the years since I've taken those courses.\n\nWhat I'd like to do:\n\n1. I'd like to be able to anonymously post content but be able to mathematically prove that I am the author. So I want to attach a public \"key\" while retaining a private key, and it can be easily confirmed by an external public entity that I am the only one capable of generating the public key attached to my content. (I don't think that's usually how public key/private key works so I recognize this is a bit different)\n\n2. I'd like to be able implement an extremely simple password system that controls which content a visitor can view. Simple example, being if I have 10 blog posts, each person I share my website with can only access certain posts depending on the password I give them.\n\n3. I'd like to have a way to timestamp my content. The simplest way I could think of was just to attach the blog post to a twitter account.\n\nNow, for actual questions:\n\n1. Can I realistically do this stuff on something simple like Bluehost with Wordpress?\n\n2. What is the easiest solution for my goals - are there free solutions that are readily available/modular/easily deployed that don't require much html work? I don't mind if my website looks like [https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/) in terms of aesthetics, I value just the content management functionality more than form.\n\n\\-\n\nIn case anyone is curious, my goal with this isn't anything suspicious, I just want to anonymously post predictions on future events without attaching my personal identity but I want to retain an enduring system of record for it so that at any time in the future I could mathematically prove I was the author of the content. (Which wouldn't be possible if someone were to hack the website because while they can change content to prove they have control, they can never \"solve\" the previous keys attached to posted content)\n\nI know this is a LOT of ask, and I am also trying to figure out the simplest possible way to do this.

To generate a signature on some content you need a public/private keypair. Step one is thus to generate such a keypair, you can then publish the public key and use the private key to generate a signature over your blogpost content. Anyone with the content and the signature can verify that the signature was created by the private key corresponding to the published public key.\n2. For this you just need some kind of access control. Basic accounts will do.\n3. What you need is the following: you want to prove that you created some content somewhere in the past without sharing the content itself. You can do this by using, for example, a hash function (a one way function), which will create a short “compressed” version of the blog post content. You can then post this hash on twitter (or even on a blockchain).\n\n1. For (1), this is possible to just post on whatever platform you like, a signature is just a string of characters. For (2) you can use any access control provided by the platform you are using (so for WordPress this is just the normal accounts). For (3) you can also post this on any platform you like.\n2. I think this might be doable for free with some WordPress plugins, you can look into WordProof which is used to post post content on a blockchain.\n\nGood luck!",

Not a good idea from an SEO perspective since crawlers won't be able to access your articles. However, this is technically feasible if you really insist on doing it. You'd have the landing page be a form where users can input the password and submit the form.

I have been building websites for about four years, but only recently transitioned away from wysiwyg platforms and am now using design programs like figma. \n\nA little background:\n\nI don’t think I’m bad at what I do, but I’m entirely self taught. My background was in marketing and I worked my way up from marketing assistant to creative manager at my marketing agency. Everything I learned was on my own and I’ve never had anybody above me with a mastery in web design, so I know that there are significant gaps in my knowledge. Especially since I haven’t gone to school for anything remotely like this. I have a basic grasp of illustrator and Indesign and also create all the graphics for our clients as well as well as our agency. So I have a strong understanding of design principles and the basics of UI/UX best practices. To be honest, because I’m the only person in my company who does this, I’m not really sure what level I’m at. This makes me insecure, but I figure the more jobs I take on, the better all get. And I’ve had solid feedback from clients. My agency sells the sites I design for between 10k and 25k (but this includes copywriting, strategy, dev, etc). Hopefully eventually I’ll have a better sense of what I’m worth.\n\nAll this to say, I’m always trying new things by jumping in the deep end. I recently took on a couple of jobs where I’ll be designing a learning platform on WordPress. I realize this isn’t the thread for WordPress, but my question is more about how to design a platform versus a website. I don’t really know where to start and I know that there’s a lot more to think about when it comes to creating a platform where people can interact with each other. \n\nThere’s a great deal of difference between a basic five page website and an online platform where you can sign in, look at your profile, interact with others, take courses, and upload files. Where would you direct me to learn more about designing a platform? Are the design principles I’m used to going to serve me here? Or do I need to learn new basics? I care a lot about meeting expectations, so I’m prepped to learn anything in need to. \n\nAny and all advice would be so appreciated.",

        "title": "Help with choosing the right CMS for migrating a blogging community website",
        "author": "Miuchik",
        "id": "nulo9f",
        "selftext": "I'll try to keep my description short, but there is a TL;DR on the bottom of the post in case if I write too much :D I really hope to get some feedback on my issue as I've already spent a lot of time on researching the right CMS and still cannot decide which one suits me best.\n\nSo I'm working on migrating a website from a now-dead and unsupported CMS and cannot choose a new CMS. I am currently looking at Drupal, Joomla, WordPress and Ghost. I am open to other CMS suggestions if there's anything else that fits my use case better, as long as the CMS is well-supported and is not going got die within the next 5-10 years.\n\nThe website is a hobby project, so I do not expect to purchase any plugins, or at least I don't want to purchase any expensive plugins (let's say that anything that costs more than $50 flat fee is expensive). I'm willing to code though, as long as I can find proper documentation and help online. I do data science for a living, hence I have a pretty basic knowledge of web development. Anything related to pure webdev scares me more than migrating a SQL database (at least at the current stage lol).\n\nSo let me describe the website first and then I'll tell what are my current likes and dislikes about each CMS. \n\nThe website is a hobby project. It's a community blogging platform. All users can create accounts and submit their posts (these mainly contain text and images, but also sometimes embedded YouTube videos and Instagram posts). They can also comment the posts, upvote/downvote posts and comments, bookmark posts and comments, and send private messages. Users can also friend/unfriend each other, but this is not too important or used much. \n\nFirst thing that I saw when I started researching is WordPress + Buddypress. I like that the initial installation is easy and fast, but I feel like WordPress was not initially made for multi-year platforms. User access management is weird. The main thing that bugs me is that for every tiny thing I need to search for a plugin. E.g., if I just want to restrict users to seeing only their own media library or disable the ability to edit somebody else's comment under their own posts, I need to either find a working plugin or hook up filters in functions.php. These are very basic permissions, why not supply them right out of the box? I've been also reading that buddypress and any other plugins that I'll put on top of the core to reach my end goal will significantly slow down the website.\n\nThe next thing that I tried was Ghost. I really like how minimalistic it is, but it still doesn't look like a good fit for my needs. In Ghost all authors are trusted users and thus are able to inject custom js. I definitely want to disable that for regular authors. Another issue is that there in no open registration for authors, they can only be invited by email. And no private messages.\n\nThen I watched some tutorials on Drupal. It looks really promising, and I like how customizable it is. The front end is not as sleek as ghost, which I'm willing to forego in exchange for better functionality. However, I cannot find a working module for private messages and reactions to posts, so maybe the only solution is coding. Also, if I start with Drupal 9 then some of the modules that are available for 8 won't be compatible. I've seen that there is OpenSocial for Drupal 8, but it's more like a private Facebook. I only need messages, blogs, likes, comments and favorites. I don't need user activity streams and status updates. I don't know if I can easily turn off all unnecessary functionality. I've read online that D9-compatible version of Open Social will be available in ~6 months or so. If anyone has had experience working with OpenSocial please let me know what you think!\n\nAs a conclusion to my search, I started researching Joomla as well. I can see that there is a free module called Blog Factory that might suit my needs, but I don't know yet how well maintained it is. I see that there is EasySocial, EasyBlog and Jomsocial, but I'm on a tight budget. In addition, I've been seeing complaints about security issues with Joomla, so I don't even know if I need to invest in it at all. \n\nSo, at the moment, I cannot decide between Drupal and Joomla. Which CMS should I choose?\n\n**TL;DR:** I am migrating a hobby project and cannot decide on a new CMS. The site is a blogging platform where users can register, submit blog post, comment, like, and bookmark posts and comments, and send private messages. So far I've test drived/researched WordPress (overwhelmed with plugins, website may be slow with buddypress & Co), Ghost (looks cool, but a lot of features are missing), Drupal (really customizable, but cannot find working modules for some features), and Joomla (not sure how good free modules are, also concerned about security issues). Right now I am deciding b/w Drupal and Joomla. Which one is better for my use case? I'm on a tight budget and would rather code than pay for add-ons. Open to other CMS suggestions! Please help, I feel like I've been stuck with choosing the right CMS for too long.",

The support I got from the career advisor was worth the entire cost of the program. I’d look to see if that’s a path that would make sense for you.\n\nOne thing to know is that UI and UX are NOT the same, although they get lumped together offer by hiring managers who know nothing about either. UI is how something looks and functions while UX is how It flows for the users. You can have a beautiful website with shit UX, or a boring one with great UX. My favorite book on the subject is Steve Krug - don’t make me think revisited.\n\nNow back to you: you know how to code already and if you can connect your coding skills to your UX thinking, that’s a solid base. I’d kill to work with engineer you can think about the UX while building out designs, when issues pop up. Try working on some personal side projects, help friends who are trying to build something, go to online conferences and make connections. Those projects will help you expand you portfolio and help make that switch.

Then slowly dip your feet into JavaScript ( this gives dynamic feeling to a site, you can do cool stuff with it )\nHtml, css and js files can be understood by any browser so you dont have to install external packages or software or any of that. Although i would recommend a decent code editor, to maintain your sanity (unless you're feeling adventurous, then notepad will do just fine). I recommend visual studio code.\nNow the above will only make you a static site where you have to edit the html to add content. This is where a CMS (content management system) comes in. Most popular one is wordpress and you don't have to know how to code to build a site with wordpress. Just install a theme and you're good to go ( if just making a site is your goal )\nWordPress is where you'll manage your blog.",

                "body": "I suggest you to first learn html5 completely with their syntaxes and basics of css3 and also the core concepts of css : flex box,grid system, positioning and their properties, box-sizing! It's been 2 months since I started learning web development.now i am at intermediate level.. things will go tough when you start working and applying the knowledge you learn. So be perfect kn basics and core concepts of html5 and css. Then start using some css frame works like bootstarp, materialize, material ui which will make your development speed. You just have to understand their classes and syntaxes. Then mimic their components like navabar,carousel,cards,grid-system which will improve your development speed... First you learn html5,css3 with basic understanding of how the things work and then move to css frame works.. i personally use bootstarp as my css framework which has a huge community support... Once you learn html and css you can play with frame works which i am doing. Never hesitate to fix the issue and don't giveup on the making things right.. try to solve issues which will make you feel very confident and keeps alway motivated.. try to search solutions on internet but never giveup... Thats my suggestion buddie. After learning this things you will know what to do next... All the best ☺️",

So I basically need a page what displays my product nicely with stories, photos, videos, etc etc. But should also be able to have some kind of webshop to direct order them.\n\nSo I need a website that does feel like a productpage with a large degree of creative freedom, but has the possibility to order stuff by hitting the order button. \n\nBesides that, I'm planning on building a second website that is just a normal webshop with all kind of brands and products (including my own) and the backing system (stock, orders, etc.) of these two should be in one management system without being obvious that it's one company.\n\nI know a lot can be made with templates/style, plugins, objects, etc. But I would like to build sometime that is easy to maintain once build correctly. \n\nAnyone has a good suggestion for a good and stable platform that does what I need?",

Each one of these things do different things. The only one you really need is HTML. As you see working with CSS each one of these skills you add greatly increases what you can do.

And, again, if you combine all of those CSS files in to one file, and all of those JS files in to one file, you have 3 requests before the images.   1 HTML file, 1 JS file 1 CSS file.   And the browser will stagger the IMG downloads to not overload the server.    Not even a few years ago, browsers were auto throttling to 4 connections at a time...",

It makes sense for a legacy system, and even now I can see the use case for a super lightweight system. It does seem a little impractical to not have any JS, but if it works it works.\n\nThere wasnt a specific decision point to use more JS.  As new techniques and browser support developed, we used more JS to improve the user experience.  Early JS support was flaky across different browsers, and back when jQuery was the only 'framework' available, you didnt want to have mission critical functions breaking because of some quirky browser or proxy server behavior.  It's only fairly recently that most proxy servers have support PUT/DELETE/PATCH requests.  This is not a light weight system.  It's used by some fairly large corporate clients for serious line of business stuff.  \n\nDon't quote me on the exact timing - this thing was originally built some 25 years ago, but has been maintained and updated and is still essentially the same core system, just with a few JS bells and whistles thrown in.  The core functionality of the system is still mainly form POST based.  We use some JS to do some fancy visual menus etc and a little bit of FORM pre processing, but those functions degrade nicely without JS.  There are a few parts of the system that use AJAX, local storage, indexed db etc, but they are for specific parts of the application where we know client support for these techs will be available.  All of this works perfectly well on tablets and a wide range of desktop browsers.\n\nYou can achieve a hell of a lot with just HTML and CSS.  I'm the main JS guy on the project and love finding places to use cool new techs, but I totally get that it is really just the icing on the cake.",

This is for all you designers who can code. \n\nHere’s the repo:\n\nhttps://github.com/Oak-Harbor-Kits/Starter-Kit-V4-Eleventy\n\nHere’s a live demo of what the site looks like out the box\n\nhttps://starterkit-v4-eleventy.netlify.app/\n\nIt comes with 5 hand coded mobile first pages in only html and css, responsive navigation that’s easy to customize, working dark mode, and working blog and contact form. \n\nIt’s built with Eleventy static site generator and has a functional blog that has all the configurations setup to connect to the Netlify cms with like 4 clicks and you can invite your client to the site to login on their domain and create their own blog posts. No Wordpress. No databases. All done with a static site generator that we configured ourselves so it all just works. You don’t have to configure anything. We already did it. Just follow the steps and it should all just work!\n\nIn the readme file there’s a video on how to convert an already built site into the new kit to utilize components for the header and footer to repeat in all pages from One file source. Just a bunch of copy and pasting and filling in some variables really. Also shows you how to move over an existing blog into the new system and connect to netlfiy and everything. \n\nWe lay every thing out for you and did all the heavy lifting. I’ll be using this for all my clients moving forward now and I wanted to share it and make it free open license to use for any of your projects that need blogs or want to use a static site generator but they were too hard to learn and configure. \n\nIf you are making a new website, just delete the pages in the kit and replace them with new ones and new css files (except the blog page, keep that!). Everything else is handled for you. Just follow the steps on how to use the kit and create your files. \n\nIf you don’t need the blog, just remove the blog folder and page. Put them back in if you ever need to add it in the future and it will still work. \n\nHope everyone likes this and it’s helpful. I spent a lot of time writing the readme file to make it easy to understand what to do even for people Who have never used a static site generator before. Which prior to a week ago was me too. So I wrote everything i wish I had explained to me if I didn’t have someone holding my hand the whole way. \n\nSo clone it and use however you want! Let me know what you think.",

Glad to see you're expanding your skill set and utilizing 11ty!\n\nHave you considered using [11ty navigation plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/) for handling navigation? As of right now, you're hard coding all the routes in header.html and repeating yourself in stuff like checking if the page is active or not. For smaller sites it might be fine, but we should avoid repeating ourselves if we can. \n\nThis plugin will allow you to add some metadata to your pages, like this:\n\n    ---\n    eleventyNavigation:\n      key: Home\n    ---\n\nwhere key is the name of your page. Optionally, you can add 'order' parameter to your eleventyNavigation to order your links however you want.\n\nThen, at the top of your header.html you set a variable like this:\n\n     {% set navPages = collections.all | eleventyNavigation %}\n\nthis will give you an array of navigation objects that you can loop through and render links. If you want to check how each navigation object looks like, you can dump them like this:\n\n    {{ navPages | dump | safe }}",

But not every variable will be a straight swap. Some borders and some backgrounds will have different colors or certain sections might need a different dark mode color than the basic variable swap. What if one border in a section has a different style and color than another and their dark modes need to have different colors? Should I make a dozen variables for every color used no matter how little it’s used? I feel like I have more control and room for customization when I have section specific dark mode styles. Maybe simpler sites can benefit from your method. But more intricate designs tend to need more custom tweaks to make dark mode feel even more immersive and aesthetically pleasing. My dark.css sheet covers the toggle and base styles for dark mode and the sections have their own specific dark mode styles based on their design. I prefer to spend a little extra time and have a much more unique and fleshed out dark mode. 🤷🏻‍♂️",

If you can built an eCommerce site with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, you'll have no issues here. It may even be easier, seeing as you can create templates for any page/component you'd need.\n\n3rd Party Apps - Supported\n\nScalability - SSG and scalability is like bread to butter. The apple to the pie. The beans to the toast. If you look through Citrous' other starter kits, you'll notice that the header and footer are separate on each page, meaning to update them all, you'll have to go through, one by one, to make the change in all places. With this kit we've built now, there's one single source of truth for the header, footer, and other reusable assets. It can't get much more scalable than that.\n\nI'm not sure how much you know about SSGs and templating languages, but I encourage - nay, urge - you to have a look into them. Maybe even start using the kit yourself. I describe it as having the best parts of a framework-driven application and a vanilla, static site.

If styles differ too, pair this with SASS mixins for extremely flexible components\n* Centralise key bits of data in a \\_data folder (phone numbers, addresses, emails etc. Could do an entire restuarant menu in a data file)\n* Automatically optimise, resize and convert images with the [eleventy image](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) plugin. All greens on Lighthouse on-demand, if you're smart with the rest of your code\n* Connect to a CMS to allow them pesky clients to do some of the website updates for you\n\nIt's because of these reasons I call 11ty+SASS a pseudo-framework for websites.

I understand the principles of designing for smaller screens - make it readable, use breakpoints.\n\nBut what about when designing for bigger screens?  Should I make my elements and font size a fixed size, or should they all scale with the viewport width?  I made a quick example of both - one that is responsive ([Example A](https://codepen.io/seanmcnally/full/RNbZEER)) and one that is fixed ([Example B](https://codepen.io/seanmcnally/full/QwLMzYm)).\n\nWhile the font size of Example B looks suuuuuper tiny on large screens, should I assume that those with larger screen resolutions will also have monitors that are physically larger than my 25\" 1440p display, and therefore will be able to read that tiny font?  And should I assume they'll have some sort of DPI setting cranked up, making it bigger anyway?\n\nOr should I assume that tiny fonts will look tiny on bigger displays, and scale all of my elements proportionally with the width, as in Example A?  I understand responsive design is paramount when it comes to modern web design, so I'd love to learn what the best practice is here.  Thanks!\n\nedit: changed links to codepen",

It’s going to depend on what type of site you’re building. If it’s like a _poster_ - then sure, tie the font size to the browser or container width and it will scale up. But if you’re making a site for public service like the DMV or something, people don’t want to read giant fonts. Think about well designed art/design type books. Just because the page is bigger - doesn’t mean you make all the type bigger. You just organize it differently. And people don’t want to read the whole width of a giant screen. They want to read 12-14 words. So, there’s nothing wrong with just setting a max with and letting the size just be 1440px wide and have the sides blank. Depends on the type of site.",

To emulate a large screen, it's the same as zooming out.  The zoom level just sets the ratio of real pixels to CSS units.\n\nWhat most sites have is a max width that the main content will take up (around 1000-1200 in my experience).  So if the screen is wider than that, there will be empty space on the sides and the main content will be centered.  If there's left or right nav bars, they'll stay glued to the very far left.\n\nYou'll notice most screens are wider than the maximum too.  On a 1080p screen most sites will have gaps on the left and right of the main content.\n\nLast thing, this is mainly for information centric websites. App-centric sites are usually designed more like applications which don't follow this pattern and use the whole screen.",

Maybe be explicit about when things should break to the next line. \n\nOne time, our design partner offered to send over an html/css sample for the layout. I don’t think they ever did, but I loved the idea. CSS is the perfect language for devs and designers to communicate effectively in terms of how exactly a design should be rendered. \n\nAnother thing that worked great was when they sent over what I call a style palette. Things like colors and typography settings.\n\nI love when designers can see the system patterns and simplify things before I get started. When I look at designs, I have to break them down into system components. \n\nThe amount of variation can multiply the amount of effort to construct the system. \n\nThe complexity of the system design can increase project costs by a linear, multiple, or exponential amount. Your decisions impact the total cost and potential value delivered by a project.\n\nIf you choose to increase complexity, you better have a solid explanation of the value gained, otherwise it’s an excess cost. \n\nThe kicker is that some complex things are easy if there’s a known solution. If you design around what’s feasible, you can go all out. The only way to know for sure is to include the engineers and validate your designs along the way. \n\nSo between figma vs prototyping, yes to both.

The best move is usually to treat those wireframes as a strong foundation and gradually layer on visuals and interactivity rather than scrapping them.

That helps you keep the structure while adapting for screen sizes. Once the design feels solid visually, you can move to code using a mobile-first approach with something like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness.

The CSS for `.search-bar` is defined separately, but its position and behavior are influenced by the form. You can also define specific styles for the form using the `form { }` selector to ensure everything is styled correctly.\n\nI recommend using the browser's inspector tool to learn about the structure of your HTML.

Font sizes as well. Paddings  etc. minimizes the number of media queries you have to write. \n\nUse flexbox for layouts. No need for the 12 column grid anymore. Just do flexbox. Set a flex direction column on mobile and change flex direction to row on tablet or desktop, whichever it needs to be. Use the gap property to set the gap between the elements. \n\nEvery section is wrapped in a section tag with 16px padding left and right and 60px-100px clamps top and bottom. This creates the optimal spacing between the top and bottoms and sides of the section. Then each section tag has a container class inside of it that’s set to width 100% and max width 1280px. This makes it responsive. Everything else set inside of it will have a width 100% and a max width to stop at. This is the core concept of mobile first responsive designs. No fixed width values. You use percentages and max widths so elements grow with the screen size and stop at their maximum width that’s in the design. By using this methodology and clamps, that’s like most of it. At most you need 1 Media query to reset the flexbox orientations and that’s it. All of the core styles and measurement values happen in the mobile first code, and as you go up in media queries you’re just changing arrangements of flexboxes. When you have to make edits, it’s all in the mobile code in one spot. Nice and easy. I like to put my mobile code in a 0rem media query so I can collapse it and add the other media queries for that section below it and collapse that too so my css is clean and organized and all the sections css is in one chunk. So much easier to edit code and work. \n\nThink of everything in terms of a flexbox and sometimes you have to use flexbox to set a base arrangement and then use margins on elements to push them away from the flexbox edges to match the design arrangements. Like if you have a container and the two elements inside it as spaced apart so they are in opposite ends of the container ( justify-content: space-between) but you notice the left element is actually 50px away from the left edge of the container in the figma design. Well you just use the space-between property to push them to the left and right sides of the container and add margin left of 50px to the left element to push it away from the container edge just like in the design. That’s how you use flexbox efficiently. Create your arrangement, and use margins and paddings to do fine tuning inside of them.",

I've seen sign in/out and account settings behind them, as well as site navigation.\n\nOnce you hide something behind a menu button you've made it far less obvious that something exists (users won't be looking for something they don't even know about) and you've also added an extra step in navigating.\n\nI prefer to keep such things limited as much as is practical so that I can have maybe four or five things visible at all times in a sticky nav bar.

All of the elements in the outline are things I've seen before, so I know they should be no problem, except one thing: An image that has clickable areas, and the clickable areas can be changed out. Specifically: a table on which there are various objects, such as a pair of glasses, a watch, a notebook, etc. Each of these objects is clickable and links to a product description page. \n\n\nSo the question is: can this be designed in a way that the clickable areas can be changed.

It's actually quite simple. You can apply the display property to table cells too, even with a simple\n\ntd { display:block; float:left; width:50%; box-sizing:border-box }\n\nAnd there you have 2 columns. Of course you can also use flexbox and more refined methods to get the same results, and you should style the headers for better readability, but  that's it.\n\nA table is an element that semantically serves a purpose, and its code shouldn't be broken down just to appease presentation",

Other things you can do is use hidden and aria-hidden text inside the cells along with the data, so in mobile you can hide the headers and show that text styled as a label. Or use css content, although unadvisable for accessibility reasons.

For example, restaurants that I know is run by chefs who's owner him/herself, and they're already busy doing their job. So the places I know doesn't have anyone and everybody doesn't have much time to learn and prepare for those tech things. Do they have time to do that?\n\nAnd are you ready to talk into them to spend more time just to match with your personal belief and preference of what-web-should-be? Try gathering numbers and statistics that doesn't involve your opinion is always the cool step to take. Try compressing PDF to eliminate rasterized fonts, font data and it might get slimmed down to the point it can be distributed without too much hassle on user end. But before going technical about it, maybe you want to listen to them first.\n\nI'm not sure how they make menus for print, but in case of PDF=menu for example: Say if they're making PDF first, they can print it and distribute the same file on web. Labor wise, that's super efficient! However if they had to update website, well they may have to make PDF anyways for print. Having two different menus might be usability and technologically more sophisticated, but if users (restaurant) aren't able to utilize it consistently, it doesn't mean much.\n\nSo you might have to come up with more elegant plan, such as edit only once on CMS and reflect both on website and menu. But design requirement for screen vs print media is often different, and I'm afraid that try solving it with media-query for printing won't cut it. (But you may want to give it a demo, however the last time I checked, the behavior was different from Browsers and printer drivers so I'm not involved with it for a long while.)",

So let's break it down (with the information you provided):\n\n`background-image: url(\"background1.jpg\");`\n\nfine.\n\n`background-size: fill;`\n\nmeans the image will fill the containing box either in height or width whatever boundary is reached first. But most likely you will have empty space right or bottom. What you want afaik is background-size: cover. So the containing box will always be filled entirely with the background image. This can - depending on the ratio and size of box and image - lead to zooming in.\n\n`background-repeat: no-repeat;`\n\nno need if cover.\n\n`background-position: fixed;`\n\ndoesn't exist. What you mean is background-attachment. But this will not work either since it will not use the size of the containing box but the size of the whole screen since it gets attached to it not to the box.\n\n`max-width: 100%;`\n\nno need, a div or any block element is not wider than that if not declared otherwise\n\n`min-width: 100%;`\n\nno need, a div or any block element is 100% if not declared otherwise\n\n`height: auto;`\n\nno need, a div or any block element will have height auto if not declared otherwise.\n\n`width: auto;`\n\nno need, a div or any block element is 100% no matter its content.

If you want to click them, you can tie onclick event to each of the rectangles, svg onclick\n\nAnother simple solution, you could do a flexbox parent with 5 children for a bottom row, (although isn’t it 7?) that way they will be responsive and always same width and height and for the top row you can do a flex parent with 7 children and put visibity:hidden on the first and forth child, if you want it to be like a piano “space-btn-btn-space-btn-btn-btn”. Then if you want them to overlap is you make the bottom row parent position:relative and put a top row parent with position:absolute and top:0. You could set a padding or margin to a top row child, so they d be skinnier than a bottom row, and make top parent shorter than bottom row, for a very piano look.\n\nOnce again, I’m not sure what you want them to do, and probably there are many other solutions, but that’s the easier approach I could think of.",

No F bombs, and absolutely no racist remarks or anything of that nature. No violent photos, no sexist remarks, no phrases that encourage violence. \n\nOne possible tool I use that you should be able to use depending on what browser you have is ctrl + f which finds any words you select on the web page.  \n\nSo it depends how old the kids are. Unfortunately I do not know where exactly the mild cuss words are. Feel free to share this website with anyone, and I can help you scout out any possible issues :)\n\nHow old are the kids and are there any pages or areas in particular that you want to show them?",

The only reason I enter size into the mix is because it is quantifiable; it shows my dedication in a clear number, and it can be used to compare it to websites of a similar type. Because \"funny\" is subjective, I only use quantifiable numbers to compare my website to others. Is it funny to me? Yes. To me, it is the worst in the world, but that is subjective. \n\nI do not know how bad your clients are at websites, but I would argue that mine is so bad that nobody could accidentally make something so atrocious, only if they were intending to create a bad website could they. That is what I argue. And you mentioned the speed, well that is a result of the massive size, further making the website worse. I cannot control the speed, and I do not want to reduce the size to increase speed. \n\nI would also argue that the content of the website is unique to me. The visual style may look very 90s, but I have not seen any website with similar content. This is largely because 95% of the content came from me. If you have examples of websites with similar content, I would love to see them. \n\nKeep in mind that the site is not just visually bad; in fact the aesthetic is just how to the content is presented. The visuals are merely the icing on the cake, while the content is really what matters.

You said you spent a decent amount of time on my website, but somehow did not read any of the content? Also why would you want to torture yourself by looking even at the small portion you have seen already. That doesn't make sense to me. \nI am not saying my website is the most unique or the worst, because those are subjective. I argue that my website is one of the worst, and that it is unique. \n\nI do not ask others to read the website to prove that it is unique. I tell the users: here is my website. If you want, take a look and maybe it will make you laugh. \nThey don't have to look at it, nothing changes for me based on the number of viewers I get, and I do not get paid. They willingly choose to look at my website, so you had better ask them. \n\nI implored you to look deeper because you have not seen very much of the website, which is obvious by you saying you have not read the content. The content is 95% of the website. You cannot judge a website by 5% of what it has after 2 minutes of looking at just the aesthetics. And you cannot judge my dedication because you have not seen hardly any of the website. \nThis is literally judging a book by its cover. It's like looking at the cover of a book and saying \"this is not unique. The author's dedication has done nothing to make this book unique\". How strong of an argument is that, with zero evidence, without even looking. There is a reason why lawyers actually look at the evidence with which they are going to argue. \n\nAnd you responded to my argument by saying it is not true, but are not willing to provide any evidence to support your argument. Keep in mind that my main goal is not to prove anything. I have nothing to prove. I think my website is unique, evidently a bunch of other Redditors do, but you may not think so; I don't really care either way. I did not make this to live up to your expectations or to argue that it is unique.\n\nAnd lastly, I have an issue with you telling me to put the content in a readable way - no. First of all, if you're trying to argue that my project of 3 years is not unique, how inclined do you think I am to listen to your suggestions? I would hope you know you that I have zero incentive to listen to your suggestion in any way shape or form. The way the content is presented is unique to me, and I will not change it because you found it to be unattractive. You know, I said it was a bad website for a reason. Did you seriously expect the content to be presented in an appealing manner?\nAt the end of the day, you chose to comment on my post. I did not make this website for you, and so I don't even know why you would waste your time telling me how to present my website. That's just bullshit.",

Because \"funny\" is subjective, I only use quantifiable numbers to compare my website to others. Is it funny to me? Yes. To me, it is the worst in the world, but that is subjective. \n\nYOUR dedication, unfortunately, doesn't do anything special for the site to make it unique - there is just more of it as I said before.

Why the hell would I put myself through that just to learn what I have already determined:  this site is bad on purpose but not in a unique way.  If you want me to read the content (assuming it isn't equally bad) then make an attempt to display in a useful way.

This is the email they sent:\n\n—————————\n\n“Good afternoon,\n\nMy name is Anton and I am a licensing specialist at the TypeType font design studio.\n\nWe noticed that you are using the commercial font on the “redactedwebsite.com” website. Thank you for choosing a font from our studio!\n\nUnfortunately, we were unable to find your web license purchase. As the developers and exclusive rights holders of TypeType fonts, we regularly check our font licensee base.\n\nWe understand that there may have been an error that caused the font license not to appear in the database. Please give us a few minutes of your time so that we can verify your font license. We would appreciate if you send a proof of purchase (e.g., a copy of an electronic receipt) from a platform where the license was acquired (Myfonts, Fonts.com, etc.).\n\nIf you can verify your purchase in any other way, please also mention this in your reply letter.\n\nWe understand that in some rare cases there is no font license. Write back to me and I will help you solve the problem as quickly as possible, including offering a suitable TypeType font license. You will be able to pay for the license any way you like. As a bonus, I will give you a discount if you order the font directly from the studio.”\n\n—————————\n\nSoooo what do I do now? I didn’t realize a foundry would really go after people using the font for personal projects. Obviously they have a right to, but I don’t really want to buy this font I’d rather just change to a free one. I’ve heard changing it isn’t enough though and they will sue you regardless unless you buy it. \n\nIs buying my only option to avoid lawsuit?\n\nUpdate: there’s some cool people in this thread but some of you need to relax and understand that not everyone knows everything. Maybe I’m dumb for not knowing this but I bet there’s a lot of people that also didn’t know.\n\nUpdate2: I’ve learned that it’s important to read the license of any font you’re using even if it’s just your portfolio. Font foundries can and will find out who didn’t pay and will potentially take legal action if you don’t comply OR they will contact your hosting provider and shut down your site.\n\nUpdate3: the guy (or bot) in the email hasn’t responded but I’m going to change the font to Inter (as much as I’ll miss my little Circular lookalike) and hopefully be done with all of this until I can afford to buy the font properly. \n\nFinal update: Comment from u/dracoumbra that sums up how to approach a situation like mine if anyone ever gets a similar email and finds this post later on:\n\n> Dear Pirate (affectionately),\n\n> You are infringing on TypeType's intellectual property. But that's ok! I mean, what's ok about it is that it was a mistake, and there are very easy paths to resolution.\n\n> To lend credulity to what I have to say, I have been a creative director for a global brand, and currently run anti-piracy campaigns for fortune 500 companies. I have been in your shoes, and the shoes of TypeType. Organizations like TypeType absolutely have a case against you that they can bring to court - but unless they're trying to make an example of you, which is rare, they won't. A single Cease and Desist letter from a reputable law firm will cost them more than a perpetual sale of the font license, so most organizations choose a commercial option for license regulation, ie: they'll scare you a tiny bit and ask you to purchase.\n\n> To mimic many responses in this thread, you have a few options: Buy the license (I recommend doing this), or stop using the font. If you buy the license, usually there is a clause that says they can't take you to court for any past infringement. You get peace of mind. If you simply stop using it, you remain susceptible to legal escalation. But again, that's extremely rare. The only thing you CAN'T do is continue using their IP without paying for it.\n\n> Most organization aren't running gotcha IP infringement honeypot campaigns to try to lure in unsuspecting graphic designers to extract punitive damages from them. Most organizations simply want the people who use their IP to pay for it. That's all.\n\n> This is not legal advice.",

You don't get things like subpoenas via email. If they sent an unsolicited legal document via email, there is no evidence that anyone actually viewed it. With thay said, the communications CAN be used against you. They are legal in terms of them being official in that capacity. Any response can be used against you. Failure to respond means absolutely nothing and is the best practice.

If you buy the license, usually there is a clause that says they can't take you to court for any past infringement. You get peace of mind. If you simply stop using it, you remain susceptible to legal escalation. But again, that's extremely rare. The only thing you CAN'T do is continue using their IP without paying for it. \n\nMost organization aren't running gotcha IP infringement honeypot campaigns to try to lure in unsuspecting graphic designers to extract punitive damages from them.

Column shrink was never an issue - you had trouble with column wrap and the image was breaking out of it's flex container.\n\nFor the wrapping issue, you missed a nowrap on the column block. Also, your @media queries are forcing the flex to become 1 column so I commented them out)\n\nSecondly, image container. Flex respects element sizes. Its a feature, not a bug. If your content is bigger than its container, it just allows it to push out. So you have to tell the image to scale according to the width of the parent container (Fix: width:100% )\n\nThe figure element and inline css style from the image were removed to allow the new css properties to take effect\n\ncodepen:\nhttps://codepen.io/mikesheaio/pen/XWXvWqd\n\nedit: I also find it strange that youre trying to avoid the best features of flexbox.

        "selftext": "Personally I am sad to be getting into design in an era where mobile is most traffic for websites, because my beautiful ideas for intuitive website layouts end up as compromised button menus etc that don't really guide the user through the website. For a lot of my projects, it's *important* that the user know that there are other sections of the website. At a glance they should have an idea of the full scope of what the website offers. Easy to do with a prominent menu on desktop, even an always visible menu, but you can't (shouldn't?) be having 4-5 menu options taking up the top of the screen and following the scroll on mobile. And hiding the menu behind a \"menu\" button makes it unlikely that a user coming in from search engines will see that the website has other sections and purposes to dive into. \n\nHas anyone a potential solution for accomplishing this? Or examples of mobile sites that do this well?\n\nAnd I would have to assume mobile websites that do this well have mobile-only pages, which is less tricky than making a responsive website that can serve both purposes?",

Uniqlo's mobile site comes to mind immediately but there are tons of others out there. Check out [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/08/bottom-navigation-pattern-mobile-web-pages/) on why bottom navigation is what we _should_ be doing nowadays that phones are getting huge.\n\nRegarding building responsive/adaptive websites, I think you should just take a refresher on modern css. Building websites that are usable on mobile doesn't rely on media queries that much anymore. The first thing that comes to mind is the [\"Look Ma, No Media Queries!\"](https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/) piece from css-tricks. Media queries should really be used in edge cases and for other things, rather than screen width breakpoints. Read the following:\n\nhttps://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/media-queries-responsive-design-2018/\n\nGrid and flex box are where it's at nowadays because they're responsive by default.
