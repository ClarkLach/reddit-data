        "selftext": "EDIT: added extra tips from other users. \n\nI see this question pop up a lot so I wanted to share with everyone how I optimize all my sites now to get a 100 page speed score and 100’s across the board in lighthouse. \n\nFor verification of my efforts, here’s a site I’m working on that scores 100\n\nhttps://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fariseconstructions2.netlify.app%2F\n\nOPTIMIZING ASSETS\n\nThis is the most impactful thing you can do. \n\nDONT LOAD A 5000px WIDE IMAGE WHEN ITS BEING DISPLAYED AT 400px. One of the BIGGEST mistakes I see in other sites is large images that don’t need to be so big. If the image is displayed in your site at 600px wide, resize it to 600px (or for better clarity on retina displays, set it to 2X display size) instead of 5000px or whatever you have. Same thing goes for mobile image. Use the picture element to serve up different sizes images for different screen sizes. Here’s the code \n\n<picture>\n  <source srcset=\"landing.jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 600px)\">\n  <img src=\"landing-m.jpg\" alt=\"landing image\" height=“600” width=“600” loading=“lazy” decoding=“async”>\n</picture>\n\nYou put the mobile sized image in the img tag and the normal sized one in the source tag. When the media query is false, it gets skipped and the default img tag source is displayed instead. So in this case if the screen size is less than 600px, load the mobile sized image. If it is at least 600px then load the normal sized image. \n\nI make my mobile images the size they’re at on the largest mobile screen. Usually I set the screen size to 400px and whatever the size the image is on that screen size I’ll resize the image to fit those dimensions. \n\nWhen I do this I save the mobile size image with the same name as the desktop version but with a -m at the end of the file name. \n\nThen I compress them with compressor.io and save those new files in the images folder and overwrite them with the new smaller versions. This saves up to 80% of the file size with minimal Loss in quality. \n\nhttps://compressor.io\n\nThen I convert all my images to webp with this service \n\nhttps://cloudconvert.com/jpg-to-webp\n\nWebp format images load 1.5 times faster than jog and 2.5 times faster than png. You should be using webp format images for everything now. It’s key to getting 100. \n\nMOBILE LANDING PAGE TRICK\n\nOne thing I do to minimize the load times on mobile is I will take the normal desktop image and crop out the center of the image like 500px wide like this:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xcJ3osL.jpg\n\nBecause why should you have to load all that extra part of the image to the left and right when it’s just gonna be off screen anyway? So I make a special Crop of the center of the image to use for mobile screens and load the full sized image on desktop. This neat little trick saves you a lot of space and helps load a lot faster without having to stretch an image to fit it. Then I compress and convert to webp. I only do this for the landing page because it can’t lazy load so I make it as small as possible by cropping it to be the same width as a phone screen with no waste. But you can do this for all background images that need to be tall and thin. \n\nBecause older safari browsers don’t support webp, you can use this script to replace all .webp with .jpg if you have the jpgs inside your images folder as fallbacks. But the images can’t be served as background images in css. It only applies to img tags in the html. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/sfnx7x/_/hurxscm/?context=1\n\nRELATIVELY UNKNOWN TRICK\n\none thing I learned that not many people know about is preloading the mobile version of your landing page image in the head tag to reduce load times. I your head tag, put this code \n\n<link rel=\"preload\" as=\"image\" href=\"landing-m.webp\">\n\nPreload lets you tell the browser about critical resources that you want to load as soon as possible, before they are discovered in HTML. This is great for background images and fonts. Which we will get to later. Preload your mobile landing page background image on every page. It will improve your load times and they get served faster. \n\nLAZY LOAD!\n\nLazy load all your images below the fold, meaning everything that Isn’t seen on the screen when your website loads. Below the fold refers to the bottom of your screen. Everything image Below that, put the attribute loading=“lazy” on them. This will lazy load them in the browser. \n\nAlso, something I never knew about before, put decoding=“async” on EVERY image tag on your site. The decoding=\"async\" attribute will tell the browser that it is OK for image decoding to be done at a later moment so that the browser can continue displaying content even if the images are not fully loaded. This also helps Load your images in a more Optimal manner. \n\nOn your picture element, you add these attributes to the img tag after the source tag, as seen in my code example i referenced earlier. \n\nAlso don’t forget to add your alt text and height and width attributes. \n\nLAZY LOAD BACKGROUND IMAGES\n\nThere’s libraries and stuff for lazy loading background images but here’s how I do it in html and css without them. \n\nYou set your picture element at the bottom of your sections outermost div where you would want a background image on, outside of any content containers. \n\nLike this. \n\nsection\n    Container \n        Content \n    /container \n    Picture element\n/section\n\nSet that outer section div to position relative and z index 1. Add a class to your picture element to target it. Absolutely position the picture tag inside the section container with a height and width of 100% and top and left value of 0. Now it will take up the entire width and height of the section and cover it, and z-index: -1 so it’s behind all the content. In your css, target your image inside your picture element either by:\n\npicture img {} or by the .pictureClass img {} and set the image values to \n\nposition:absolute;\nheight: 100%;\nwidth: 100%;\ntop: 0;\nleft: 0;\nobject-fit: cover;\n\nThis will make the image act like a background image and cover the entire height and width of the picture element tag which is basically just a semantic div wrapper around your image. The negative Z index on the picture tag will place it behind all the content in the container and the z index of 1 on the container will prevent it from going behind the body and not being visible. \n\nDon’t forget to make a 500px wide crop of your background image for mobile, compress, convert to webp, and lazy load and add the decoding attribute too and the boom! A lazy loaded background image that serves up a smaller sized mobile image on phones. \n\nWhat’s basically happening is the picture tag is acting like a div around the image tag. We make the picture element absolutely positioned to be the same height and width of the main container in which we want a background image, then we make the image stretch to cover its container (the picture element) and it looks exactly like a background image, except the image tag can take the lazy loading and decoding attribute. \n\nThis technique will SIGNIFICANTLY improve your load times if you normally load desktop images as backgrounds on mobile and don’t resize or compress or convert. Lazing loading background images is a great way to shed some dead weight and improve your scores even more. \n\nI know this may seem like a lot of work but it’s really not once you commit it to your workflow. It goes by fast and your scores will jump up dramatically by serving up your images like this. \n\nPRO TIP!\n \nGo to fiver and find a good svg graphic designer. Have them convert your clients png logos into svgs for like $20 and Load those instead on your website. Loading svgs for logos on mobile is a huge boost and looks much better. It’s totally worth it. I do this for ALL of my clients, complimentary. They love it and it makes mobile load faster and look better. Do it! I load them in via a regular image tag. \n\nHOW TO OPTIMIZE FONTS\n\nThis is a huge pain point for a lot of people. And I’m going to show you how to locally host your fonts, how to fix “flash of unstyled content”, and preload them for faster loading. \n\nFirst, DONT go to google fonts. Go to google fonts helper. And try to only use 2 fonts max with as few font weights as possible to minimize the file sizes you have to load. \n\nhttps://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts\n\nSearch for the font you need and select it \n\nThen select the font weights you need. For the best performance, I like to only use 400 and 700. I let the browser estimate the rest. It’s called faux styling and it’s when the browser applies its best guess to the weight and italics. So for minimal load sizes, choose 400 and 700. \n\nThen where it says copy css, click on “modern browsers” to get the modern code. Underneath the css box there’s even an option to customize the file path to your fonts folder. \n\nCopy and paste that css into your css stylesheet that will be shared on all your pages on the website. Then don’t forget to add font-display: swap; inside your font face declarations. I usually just plop it right after the font weight on all font face declarations. \n\nThen download your fonts from the click to download button at the bottom. Unzip the folder and dump them in your /fonts folder. \n\nCongratulations. You just locally hosted your fonts! No more google fonts cdn. \n\nNow you need to preload the font with this code you put in the head right under your image preload link \n\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/assets/Pacifico-Bold.woff2\" as=\"font\" type=\"font/woff2\" crossorigin>\n\nChange the file path to the file path for your font. This will help a ton when your website loads and should be standard practice for all pages from here on out. \n\nFIX FLASH OF UNSTYLED CONTENT\n\nSometimes you’ll get a content layout shift of like .004s because of your landing page text. What’s happening is the browser loads its system default font first and then swaps it out for the @font-face fonts you’re loading in. How do we fix this?\n\nWe set the fallback font in your font family declaration to a system default font that most closely matches its size and shape. We do that with a font style matcher that you can use here:\n\nhttps://meowni.ca/font-style-matcher/\n\nHere’s a good list of browser default fonts to use. Scroll down to see what they all look like \n\nhttps://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-safe-html-css-fonts\n\nSo on the font style to be matched on the right side you upload the font you’re using on the home page from your /fonts folder and you’ll see at the bottom there will be text showing that font. On the left you type in the browser default font from the list I linked and find the one that most closely matches that size. If you’re text on the home page is 20px set both fonts to 20px with your slider. Then check to see that their line heights match up too. I use a small terminal widow or something and line up the bottom of the text lines to make sure they are perfect with the top edge of that terminal window. That’s how I like things up. If they’re off by a pixel or two I change the line height of my websites text on the right to match the height of the browser default font on them left. Once i have it perfect, I change the line height of that text to match what I found in the font style matcher.\n\nSo if I had Lato as a font for my site. My fallback font would be Arial. I’ve tested it already. So it’d look like this \n\nfont-family: \"Lato\", Arial, serif;\n\nThere you have it. No more content layout shift from your landing page content and no more “flash of unstyled content” errors. They will Load seamlessly. Took me forever to find this solution and it really works. It was frustrating me to no end why I’m getting the errors and this is how you solve it! It will take some trial and error and you’ll have to do it it twice if you have a bold h1 on top of regular weight h2 or they’re different font sizes. Tweak their line heights using Ems. I start adjusting my the hundredths sometimes. Like 1.49em and if it’s still a little off I’ll do 1.47em to shift them very carefully until into perfect. \n\nGOOGLE ANALYTICS\n\nYou can asynchronously load analytics with this code \n\nhttps://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs#alternative_async_tag\n\nAnd put it at the bottom of your head tag. This will significantly reduce its impact on your load times from google analytics. \n\nMINIFY YOUR CSS ANS JS\n\nI use Netlify to host all my static sites and they have options in my build and deploy settings to Minify my css and js. So that’s neat. But there are other options out there to do it. Just make sure you’re doing it. It will help reduce the size of those files. \n\nUSE SVGS WHEREVER POSSIBLE\n\nI use flaticon to customize and download thousands of SVGs that I use for my projects. Best $10 a month I ever spend. \n\nhttps://www.flaticon.com\n\nI serve them up in image tags so it cleans up the DOM and is easier to manage. So like your social media icons and phone and email icons, icon graphics for cards, etc. svg as much as you can. \n\nThen I optimize all my svgs with this tool\n\nhttps://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/\n\nYes you’d an even optimize svgs! Save as much space as you can. \n\nDEFER NONESSENTIAL JAVASCRIPT\n\nIf your js files don’t need to execute for the page to Load properly then place them at the bottom of your body and add the defer attribute to them so they defer their loading till after the website has loaded and they don’t “render block” it and prevent the website from loading because they has to execute first. \n\nREMOVE JQUERY AND OTHER 3RD PARTY SCRIPTS\n\nIf you can, remove any third party scripts you don’t really need like JQuery. JavaScript has come a long way and can do many of the things JQuery used to only do. I reworked my clients sites to not use JQuery anymore and it helps jump up your page speed and security. It’s time to start moving away from JQuery if you haven’t already. \n\nAnd that’ll do it. Once you do all of this it will get you closer to 100 than you’ve ever been. I’ve had a couple people reach out to me to tell me my methods helped them get to their first 100 and they didn’t think it was possible. But it is! And I wanted to share with everyone how I do it for real websites with lots of images and content, not just for sites with mostly text and not a lot of content. You can have a full fledged website and score 100 page speed scores if you follow these best practices. Hope this helps, try it out and see for yourself!",

Using a picture and srcset with 2-3 tags instead of one, is no problem, because it is efficient and correct. Rendering a full tree of elements when you could wait with rendering that, is a bad practice that is more like possibly hundreds of elements rendered for no reason.",

        "selftext": "# Howdy r/web_design.\n\n[u/shepbryan](https://www.reddit.com/user/shepbryan) here, long-time Squarespace builder and digital creator.\n\n**This year I've seen lots of posts exploring the merits/limits of Squarespace 7.1.** \n\nToday I'm sharing a website overhaul case study that might be useful to some of you as you consider whether to make the swap. *As a quick aside, I've already built 5 or 6 sites on Squarespace 7.1  during the quarantine so I'm pretty familiar with the new platform's pros and cons. I've also built around 30 sites on Squarespace 7. Feel free to AMA in the comments if you have any questions of your own.*\n\n# First: a little bit of the big picture.\n\nI'm currently the Creative Director at TomiLlama.com, a digital-first self-help project my family launched in 2017. We are a top Google result for tons of keywords related to personal growth.\n\nWhen we first launched our brand and website on Squarespace, we didn't know what we were doing. Over time, we developed a strong understanding of the search intent behind new visits to our site.\n\nOnce we started to align our blogging strategy with that intent, our site took off. The last 18 months have been a rocketship of organic growth via search, and in 2020 we've already had 45,000+ unique visitors and about \\~950 new email signups in the last 30 days...\n\nWith this deeper knowledge of the intent behind our visits, (and knowing  that we're planning our first e-course launch for July) I figured it was  time to revamp our CSS-laden [TomiLlama.com](https://tomillama.com/) from Squarespace 7 (Rally template) and make some crucial improvements.\n\nWhile building the previous website in 2018, I only had a basic understanding of UI/UX principles and SEO/CRO best practices. Over time the site got a little better with tweaks here and there, but eventually, it had become a CSS Frankensite.\n\nI had to be painfully careful with my styling changes because I might randomly break something on a page without realizing for days or weeks.\n\nStill,  by matching our site's content to customer intent we were able to overcome a mediocre site layout and deliver clear value to visitors,  reaching email signup rates of 5-8% on our top blog posts.\n\n# My hypothesis for rebooting the site was that if we tackled the following objectives, we would see a lift in our website KPIs of time on page, pages per session, and email signups:\n\n1. *Create a more consistent blog layout with value-centric CTA's for our lead magnets*\n2. *Distill the sitemap to our key pages and simplify our nav menu options*\n3. *Improve our internal link structure to connect the dots for visitors (and search engine crawlers) on our related blog topics*\n\nAs  I got started planning the new site, the decision became one of building out a new version of the old site on Rally again, but scrubbing much of our clunky custom CSS, useless meta tags, weak image captions,  etc...\n\nOR\n\nTackling the reboot on a fresh Squarespace 7.1 template and simply leaning into the new aesthetic + builder functionality, troubleshooting along the way, and trusting in the process.\n\n# I ultimately decided Squarespace 7.1 was the way to go, and here is some of my reasoning.\n\n**With our 7.0 site,**  we couldn't incorporate our design system into the website aesthetic very easily... we basically had to choose between one or two colors at all times because by default you either have your background color or  you have an alternate color that is overlaid on whatever background  image you've uploaded. The 7.0 Squarespace builder isn't very versatile  for someone who wants to build a website with a variety of  customizations without getting into the use of CSS/Javascript.\n\n**With 7.1, you can get more granular control over your site design before you need to use CSS.**  More specifically – with the Color option added to the new Design page  layout, we were able to create section layouts with very specific design  customizations.\n\nFor example, we don't use our alternate color of dark purple on our default palette very frequently... or ever actually.\n\nSo  I took that specific Color option and fully customized it with a unique newsletter block layout, image block layouts, a different color background, etc.\n\nBasically with  7.1, you can make independent customizations for different elements in  each color palette. That's up to 10 on-call page design themes you can  potentially work with while building a site, or even a single page!  Sure, Squarespace defaults these palettes to automatically match the  colors you've selected... but you can absolutely break that mold and  repurpose the palette system for your own creative benefit. I used the  specific customized section I mentioned for our lead magnets so site  visitors who hit multiple pages get a consistent experience.\n\n# An interesting twist: I opted to manually build our blogs out as pages, instead of using the actual Blog page layout provided by Squarespace and a /blog URL slug:\n\nThis may seem like a strange thing to people unfamiliar with Squarespace, but working within the limitations that are baked into the Squarespace platform often becomes a constraint you need to creatively address. For example, blogging on Squarespace generally requires you to use a page type called... \"Blog\". However, the Blog page format is not very versatile in terms of page design.\n\nSo there are two reasons for me choosing to build my own blog page layout with breadcrumb navigation.\n\n**The first is that the new index page builder in Squarespace 7.1 is extremely powerful.**  It's highly customizable (see previous explanation of using various  color palette themes on the same page) and I feel empowered to make a  beautiful layout when I look at it. Drawing inspiration from Brian  Dean's site Backlinko, I made sure our blogs each had clear section  titles with anchor links as well as alternating color backgrounds in the  body text of our content.\n\nThe  hypothesis here is that the visual separation of information makes it  easier for readers to chunk and consume. It's extremely clear as you  scroll down one of our blogs that there is a finite number of sections  that are smartly labeled, and the general impression for new visitors is  that the info is well-organized and easy-to-access. This is something  that would be a massive pain in the ass to do on Squarespace's default  blog page layout. The caveat here is that now I need to set up Disqus  for each blog page if I want to regain the use of a comments section on  our blogs. Still troubleshooting this piece.\n\n**The  second is that in terms of page weight for SEO, Squarespace weighs home  pages at 1.0, standard pages at .75, and blog posts at .5.** By manually  creating my own blog page structure with breadcrumb navigation, our  best content will now be weighted more heavily in the eyes of search  engines (at .75 instead of .5). I'm not entirely sure about the science  behind this, but I couldn't find anything telling me NOT to do this and  as far as sitemaps go I could see that high-ranking sites like [backlinko.com](https://backlinko.com/) and [jamesclear.com](https://jamesclear.com/)  don't have /blog in their URL slugs either. I'm no supreme SEO god, so  don't take this as a divine mandate. Again, it's just personal  experience and good research leading me to this decision.\n\n# Overall, the new site is blowing the old one away on all of our KPIs.\n\nFor us the swap has been absolutely worth it, bugs included.\n\n**Breakdown of my goals, the post-launch results, and my checklist for getting there.**\n\n**Goal 1:** Improve our rate of email signups with better blog layouts & clear CTAs for our lead magnets\n\n**Goal 2:** Keep people on our site longer with more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user experience\n\n**Goal 3:** Simplify our design & content management system\n\n**Goal 4:** Make it visually clear that Tomi Llama is a world-class digital brand in the self-help industry\n\n**Results after launching:**\n\n* \\+75% increase in form submissions on [TomiLlama.com](https://tomillama.com/) from 307/week before to 537/week after.\n   * This  metric is measured in Squarespace's analytics and it's very useful from  a CRO perspective. It tells us what specific forms were submitted,  which page they are on, as well as the # of unique views, submissions,  and the conversion rate for each form. Some of our forms are now  converting at >18%! 😮\n* \\+37% increase in actual Mailchimp subscribers from 210/week to 288/week.\n   * The  big disparity between form submissions / new subscribers is due to Tomi  Llama superusers who sign up for multiple lead magnets during a site  visit. Our new site is more intuitive to explore, and we define each  lead magnet's value in a prominent location on-page.\n* \\+22% average session duration\n   * Most  of our essential pages now average over 1min per session. We  restructured the information on each blog post to follow a similar  system that lets readers go as deep as they want on a topic. Simpler  content at the top, deeper stuff towards the bottom.\n* \\+18% overall page view\n   * Users  are finding it easier to explore more of our site since our internal  linking structure dramatically improved with our blog revamps\n\n**My checklist for reaching this goal:**\n\n* Review  our highest converting forms to see what insights I could gain about  alignment between the content and the perceived value of a lead magnet\n* Review  actual anonymous user visits to the site using Lucky Orange, an  analytics tool. I was able to see heatmaps of user interactions on our  pages to learn what was being clicked and what was being ignored, how  far down a page the average user was scrolling, as well as understand  how new users were exploring the site. From there, I tried to condense  all the best parts into the higher visibility parts of the blog.  Basically, if only 25% of people were actually scrolling down to  discover the lead magnet, we were functionally losing 75% of visitors  who didn't even know there was more value for them to receive. We now  have lead magnet forms in the first 10% of the scroll on all posts.\n* Study  some of the best SEO-oriented websites on the internet to understand  how they structure their content to look good and also hit their on-page  SEO keywords. I heavily dug into Brian Dean's site, Backlinko.com, for  inspiration. You'll notice our blog layout is adapted from Brian's  fantastic definitive guides, down to the alternating background  sections.\n* Map  our entire site's SEO plan using Airtable. This way I could see that we  were hitting all the appropriate keywords for H1/H2 and body text.\n* Use  Ahrefs to scour the top pieces of content for our best keywords and  effectively incorporate the best of the best into our own materials.  This tool also gives you an idea of how easy it can be to create a  definitive piece of content that's better than what else is out there.  Without Ahrefs, I would still have this looming sense that I'm missing  something or that someone else is going to outpace us with better  content. Ahrefs Content Explorer let me easily review hundreds of blog  posts across our niche, and ultimately I came away feeling really good  about the quality of our own content.\n* Use  Ahrefs again to audit our site once it was live to find any broken  links I may have missed. I ended up finding 4 broken links, 4 incorrect  redirects, and a handful of anchor links that needed a little update.  This was the final house-keeping piece of the site launch for me.\n\n**My findings from the research and review stage:**\n\nThe  old site ultimately wasn't very intuitive to navigate – our nav menu  included slugs like \"Llama Store\" and \"Meet Tomi\" that were unfamiliar  and thus not compelling to new visitors. Additionally, there were so  many different things in the overall UI of the site and our blog posts  that NO ONE was clicking. I'm talking ZERO people clicking a button,  link, image, product, etc., out of thousands of visits. So I decided we  would streamline and build out the new site around what was working the  best for us – our top six blogs / lead magnets.\n\nRather  than peppering forms throughout our blogs willy-nilly and hoping  someone might sign up, we restructured our blogs to follow a 3-step  informative process that is logical for someone who is first exploring a  topic and also useful for someone who is returning to explore again. We  added anchor links and clear section titles to all content. And we  added a lead magnet signup at the top of each blog, and again around the  30-50% mark of a blog.\n\nWith this  new structure, each section has a clear explanation of the value to the  reader that also ties back to our lead magnets.\n\nThe  results have blown me away. Before our new site was live, we saw  between 250-300 form submissions per week as measured via Squarespace's  Form Analytics. At the end of the rainbow, this was resulting in roughly  180-200 new subscribers being added to our Mailchimp list weekly. The  true tally of new subscribers has never aligned with our actual forms  submitted tally on Squarespace, due to users signing up for multiple  lead magnets during one visit. I won't say there's any sort of maxim you  can extrapolate from this for your own venture – it's just what I've  learned to expect from the Tomi Llama audience.\n\nWith  the new site live, our first week of submissions totaled 537 form subs  on Squarespace and 288 new subscribers in Mailchimp. Compared to the  week before our site launch which had 307 form subs on Squarespace and  about 210 new subs in Mailchimp. Some quick maths here to get the  increase in conversion rates:\n\n**Our increase in on-site form submissions is \\~75% (537/307=1.749)**\n\n**Our increase in new subscribers is \\~37% (288/210=1.371)**\n\nThis  wasn't a fluke by any means. We planned out our digital overhaul and  executed it with zero hiccups. Even flipping our old site over to our  new site had less than 1 hour of downtime, meaning we lost minimal  subscribers during that down hour on our site. Once the site was fully  live, I made sure to submit the new sitemap to Google Search Console and  do a site audit with Ahrefs.\n\n# Here's what I attribute these improvements to:\n\n* **Significantly better UI/UX**\n* **A deeper understanding of our customer journey.**  The goal for us at this point is to give people amazing free content,  offer them a supplementary resource that improves their experience with  the free content in some way, and add them to our email list. We're  launching a premium e-course next quarter that is built specifically for  our 5k+ subscribers.\n* **High level of clarity for site visitors as to what the value we are offering them is**… breaking it down with smart copy and clear value propositions with our lead magnets\n* **Better creative.**  I've been working with an illustrator/watercolorist in Atlanta for the  past few years to create Tomi's signature Studio Ghibli-esque aesthetic.  On this project, everything finally came together. I had lots of great  resources like hi-res watercolor paintings, vector graphics of our llama  characters, and many digital mockups of our physical goods like books,  values cards, and worksheets.\n* **And yes, building on Squarespace 7.1**!  I love the new Squarespace builder. I've already built 5-6 sites using  it and it makes it much easier to maintain a consistent brand aesthetic  across many different web pages. I used the new Color palette feature to  create a series of customized page layouts that my other team members  can easily replicate as our site continues to grow and expand with new  content. I think ultimately 7.1 represents a leap forward in terms of  using Squarespace to underpin the design systems of a business. 7.1  makes establishing that system a much easier process than before. Just  be sure you take notes while you design so other's can replicate the  work.\n\n# Bugs I observed during the project:\n\n* For some reason our billing is buggy and won't update to recognize a new credit card. I've contacted support.\n* During  the site swap, the first time I submitted the sitemap to Google I got  an error. I assume this was because there was a hiccup in our */sitemap.xml* link from Squarespace as the site got flipped over. I waited 6 hours and resubmitted successfully.\n* For  some reason about 0.5% of form submissions return a \"form submission  error\" even though we've double-checked all our form connections to  Mailchimp/Zapier.

At one of my previous workplaces developers were using some popstar's name as the test email address. We were asked by the popstar's webhost/team to knock it off. Our SMPTP/mailer configuration was misconfigured and we were sending several emails to the popstar's fan mailbox each time our CI suite ran.\n\n`example.com` is a domain specifically made and maintained by IANA to be used an example. It is stable and can not have its ownership transferred. Using `example.com` instead of `yourdomain.com` or whatever people come up with is less distracting in documentation and avoids the risk of accidentally sending traffic somewhere.",

And criteria in minds of rich guys might be unpredictable. So be open, talk more and always try to help peoples first at least with real good advices (even small). If it is good advices they will clearly understand you are expert.\n\n- Same with hired employees. Filter more and more. Find hardworking guys. Sometimes even astrology might help you to understand it. Test tasks are also good.\n\n- Pay employees by hourly rate salaries. Use tool like https://tracklify.com to track executors time using randomized 10 minute screenshots. Better improve the rate, but Pay for real proven work. Not for vacations and other things. They will much better understand their value if they will feel you pay for every hour of their work. Also same tool can be used to create hourly invoices for clients.",

                "body": "So To start I decided on a niche market to target. Then I searched theme forest to find some Wordpress themes I liked in that space and made 3 templates myself in html and css based on those themes. 1 simple one for those businesses that don’t need or want much, then one middle of the road one that has more style, is modern without being TOO fancy. It’s just a Nice looking site that can be used by anyone. Then my third is a higher end looking design that looks like it’d fit with a more expensive or luxury brand company in this niche I targeted. This way I can target all types of businesses within my niche and have options. A higher end client won’t like the simple template, and Vice versa. \n\nI used these three templates to expand my business. I’d sell all three in a market, which is like a 2 hour radius. Don’t wanna sell the same template in an area. Once I sell all three in an area I find somewhere else in the state or another state and sell three more in that area. Eventually I’d run into people who didn’t like any of my templates and I had to design new ones that fit their tastes and added that yo my arsenal of templates. \n\nSlowly I expanded the number of templates I have to 10+ And expanded into various industries like behavioral health, debt collection, restaurants, and logistics. \n\nWith these templates I was able to expand rapidly by focusing more on sales rather than development. Most I’ve done in a week was 5 new clients start to finish in 7 days. That was a wild week. But my workflow allows me to do it. It would be impossible to do that if I built 5 custom websites. I spend 3-5 hours per new site adding the new content and optimizing it’s page speed. What’s great is they are actually really really good products. Why reinvent the wheel every client? I use the same responsive navigation for all my sites so I’m not starting over from nothing. And when I make new designs I only do a home page. All my interior pages are templates and I use the same pages for everyone. Studies show no one gives a shit about them. So I made simple interior page templates that I use for all my clients. So when I do have to design and develop a new page I’m only doing a home page, which significantly reduces the amount of time I have to design and code. I can’t code an entire home page now in less than 8 hours. So even when I have to design a develop a new site it only takes me maybe 8 hours to do it. Which is 3 more than it takes to fill in and optimize a template. So the time invested is not as much as normal developers time invested. Where it might take them 40 hours to do a new custom 5 page website from scratch I can do it in less than 10. Sometimes even less. It’s all about templetizing the work that is repetitive and spending your time more wisely where it gets the most return for the investment. I’m really not trying to be cocky when I say this but I can do more working my business part time than others can do full time. It’s because of the process, templating, and not rebuilding things that I already built. \n\nAs a disclaimer, it took me a while to actually build my first templates, probably a week or two. Which is typical. But Over time I have perfected making static sites to the point I am now wrapping up one of my current newly designed homepages in 3-4 hours, mobile to desktop. Everything. I learned a new method of coding responsive websites that is saving me 30-40% of my time and I have never seen it used before online or in any tutorials. I will be making a YouTube playlist of me building a whole website with this method and I think it will surprise some people. \n\nHope this was helpful!",

I live in South Africa and I assume small businesses here will be detered by a subscription model, but I could be wrong!\n\nWhy do think the clients stay on and spend more money than they would (in the long term, if they're confident their business will be around in a few years) if they paid for a professional website of equal quality in 2 installments and then spent less per month for hosting and support service? If they can't afford it upfront I don't see the logic in spending more over-time and carrying more expenses, as opposed to taking a loan.",

If you're scaling the clients, you're scaling the amount of support calls and troubleshooting time, which is a bit daunting from my current perspective. Are you planning on outsourcing the support side of the business or are you still comfortable with taking it all on yourself? I assume it's not bothering you much and totally worth the business. How many clients do you currently have and how much of pain in the ass is the support? Are you receiving calls during leisure time forcing you to exit and jump onto a laptop? If the site goes down on Sunday, do you reply on Monday or are you on call legit 24/7? 24/7 support sounds great to the client, but scary for the service provider to deliver, and a little stressful knowing you may be called to action at any moment, with the probability increasing with business growth?",

Your timing is probably quite right as this is when new SSO trends and better security practices were rolled out by major companies.     These products need to support many services across many devices, and most of them do not require passwords to verify anything. For example, using any social login will handshake your already existing logged in account. Two-factor authentication will ask you to verify on another device. Finger print, well yeah. These cases all contribute to the need for entering passwords. As a result, the UI needs to update to reflect numerous scenarios any given user out of millions has to encounter. The trade off is a shift in how we do verifying on the web. Its a lot more secure these days and it's better for us. Quite a cool change and a nice design challenge if you ask me. I hate having to enter in my password if I can avoid it, and almost always log in using google 'one click button', knowing that my account is secure.

In the past I would turn my manager's dashboard/management site into a PWA and they loved it, because it worked just like an app on their phone.\n\nThat part still works great, the problem is Apple and Google will try to make the experience very annoying for the developers.\n\nWe all know about Apple's hatred for PWA even though ironically they came up with the idea...\n\nGoogle used to be cool and there was a pipeline to turn your PWA into a native app for the google play store. That worked well for many years but I guess Google's new era of enshittification has no bounds.\n\nI have had my Google Play store dev account since 2016 and for some reason Google has removed my apps from the play store due to lack of new apps and or updates. The apps are done, there is nothing to update and I'm not doing an update for update's sake, that is just stupid.\n\nGoogle's \"alternative\" solution is that I give my address and phone number. Last time I gave Google my phone number through Youtube I started getting a lot of phone spam, Google was the only new entity to obtain my private phone number for a while, coincidence? Maybe but I doubt it.\n\nSo now the Google play store will hold my apps hostage until they can spam my number again. Yea fuck that and fuck google.\n\nThe beauty of a PWA and Web dev is that it can be accessed from a URL and it is not beholden to some rent seeking gated garden that makes the experience worse for the user.\n\nWeb > apps\n\nTL:DR Google is holding my play store apps hostage after being their for years in exchange for my phone number so they can send me phone spam.\n\nThank you for reading my Sunday rant.",

You will be constantly evaluated (silently) on 3 things: how well do you communicate, how fast do you process new information and do you have the minimum knowledge required to do your job. No certificate in the world will overshadow those. Also for many us who are in their 30's and 40's, school has been so many years and milestones ago, we can't even related to who we were back then. Only people who talk about school are other juniors.\n\nI'd say focus really hard on 1 project. 2 polished demos is enough.  You just need proof of previous work and quality, that is it. Every company will have their own tools and workflows. The best thing you can do is to figure out their stack (job description + scrape employee info on linkedin) and do a tiny demo with their stack. That will really score points as every company hopes that the candidate will just fit with whatever they are using.\n\nDon't say that you want to become management. There are limited places at the table and the managers are really protective of their position. Asking for it will always come with resistance.

I can't see any benefit where either of those roles would overlap so I'd choose a direction you'd like to go. Even easier to wear only 1 cap if you're within an agency as you're paid to be more specialised. Its only when you're a freelancer that you may want to widen your offerings if you're struggling to fill your hours.\n\nHowever I do agree, 3 months of payroll would normally be accepted in a banks eyes for a mortgage... so I'd just get whatever you could for the highest income for 3 months, get the mortgage and then either look for a different job or side hustle a freelance career until you can quit your job.\n\nSome people aren't cut out to be freelancers though and much better suited to be employees. Theres no right or wrong but its VERY useful to be honest with yourself and decide which you are.\n\nMy finger in the air advice is still to try to firm up specifically what you want to do. I'm not sure what a junior role pays in your country but if its enough for a mortgage then just try and get a job doing that in say frontend coding or ux design or which ever sounds more interesting... off the back of that though you'd benefit from trying to solve a few real world problems (or at least 1) to put you in good stead for the interview.\n\nGood luck either way! and buy a good office chair!",

It turned out that it was a combination of minor details that got summed up together and produced the shitty result:\n\n1. I screwed the REM - I don't know where it turned sour, but it was my first time using Tailwind and before that, I think I had hard-coded 1 rem = 10px or sth like that (can't remember the tutorial) and on Tailwind it's 16px, so all my designs were a bit upscaled by the browser.\n2. I haven't properly cross-checked the design between my monitors. It turned out that the designs were very different on my secondary monitors vs. my main 4k monitor. I'm not sure where I fcked up, but now I know where to look for solutions.\n3. Firefox also added its three cents and some gradients aren't displaying properly, it seems.\n\nAt least I know I can hard-code some half-transparent gradients to smooth things out in strategic places and make the design viable now. Victory in the battle, though the war continues!\n\n// old post\n\nI'm a desinger who learned2code and I've starded coding websites for clients. I've got a stonemason as a client and I've developed some components in Photoshop that were using raster images to make the site look like a slab of sandstone with negative relief buttons. My design file is an absolute mess, so I won't share it, but let's say it looked like a painted, ancient Egyptian stone slab with carved in letters and blue and gold paint here and there.\n\nLet's pretend that the design in Photoshop looked decent - I decided it looks good and interesting. So I began to cut out the parts and use them as textures and background-images.\n\nIT ALL LOOKED LIKE SHIT\n\nLike, it was the exact same images, however in Photoshop it looked nice, but on website it was absolute trash. I think I saw something similar on some conspiracy page which looked like half-baked HTML code mixed with vomited CSS and google-imaged \"textures\" that retained the watermarks.\n\nMy theory is that it's the scaling issue, but I tried and tried to fix it and nothing good came out of it.\n\nDoes anyone know any resources on how to use raster textures in web-design? Or maybe it's a completely wrong route and I'm not gonna go far down this road?\n\nSo far I've rebuilt the website, simplified a lot of the code, managed to get some decent results with parts of the approach, but the buttons look bad. I get that simple 2D colors tend to be easy-to-use, but due to artistic fetish, I don't want to copy another bastardized material design. I'm using Tailwindcss as a back-bone, but I'm trying to style it heavily to make the site look interesting. It's about creating something artistic and unique for me.\n\nThanks in advance for help.",

If you have a 400px image, it will likely look good at 400px, 200px, 100px, etc. Always go down in size and never up, and preferably in powers of 2.\n\nAlso pay attention to DPR (Device Pixel Ratio). A lot of computers and phones these days use a high density display, which means that something that is 1px big in Photoshop might actually take up 2-4 physical pixels in real life. This means if you need an image that displays at 400px, then your Photoshop file needs to be at least 800px.\n\nLastly you can try playing around with the [CSS image-rendering property](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/i/image-rendering/).

        "author": "Ok-Stuff-8803",
        "id": "1jzer4b",
        "selftext": "How has this continued to be a thing, and how did this get approved internally?\n\nThe Shopify Admin UI is a complete mess. It's genuinely hard to believe this shipped — and worse, that it's still the current experience, worse yet they appear to have even double down on it.\n\nLet’s start with the **lack of contextual awareness**. Navigation feels arbitrary — features and settings are rarely where you’d logically expect them to be. It often feels like the structure was designed by people who never actually *use* the platform day-to-day.\n\nThe **UI design itself is objectively poor**. Even at launch, it was hard to use — small text, cramped layout, and non-distinct buttons. And then somehow, they made it even worse. Recent updates have shrunk font sizes further and tightened spacing, making things even more difficult to parse visually. There’s almost **no visual hierarchy**. Buttons, links, and interactive elements all blend together — which is baffling considering they often do *completely different things*.\n\nThe **card layout and spacing** are atrocious. Everything is packed into narrow containers a lot of the time, likely a result of trying to optimize for tablet screens or a minimum screen width — at the cost of usability on desktop, where most admins actually work but then they change their mind in other areas and fill the screen.\n\nThe **product management pages** have become a chaotic jumble of misaligned sections, inconsistent UI patterns, and hidden settings. It’s almost hostile to workflows.\n\nWhen you switch to something like the **Analytics** section, you get a bit of UI breathing room — but then you realize that the **data is wrong**. Regularly. We've had clients come to us confused or panicked over metrics that make no sense, only for us to discover that Shopify's data was just flat-out inaccurate. We’ve had to implement Google Analytics or other third-party tracking solutions *just to get reliable numbers*.\n\nThe whole interface is also **visually dead**. Everything is grey. There’s no visual differentiation, no personality, and no cues to guide the eye. It’s not just boring — it’s inefficient.\n\nAnd don’t get me started on **basic navigation failings**. You’d think “Pages” would be part of “Content,” right? Nope. Go to the Content section, and there are no Pages. Instead, to access Pages (along with Themes and Preferences), you have to:\n\n1. Click on **Sales Channels**\n2. Wait for a **popup modal**\n3. Select **Online Store**\n4. And *then* magically, those items appear in the nav\n\nHow does that make any logical UX sense? It’s a puzzle hunt just to find basic tools. It is not as if the menu is packed with items, it is so small and packed into that top corner as if they were desperate for space when it isn't.  \nAnd finally, it is yet another company tacking in A.I features which seems completely hopeless across the board a lot of the time because it has been implemented so quick and dirty.",

Right now it shows I have 6 sites down that are up...\n   * Reports - the branding looks awful and I cant customize the noise out of it\n   * Backups - daily is dope but they limit to 30 days, what happens if there was an issue saved more than 30 days ago? No option to offload backups somewhere else\n   * Performance plugin - like most plugins for performance, causes random issues with updates that require manual clearing.\n* The Domain/DNS platform UI is clunky\n* The \"Reseller\" Platform was what originally attracted me but it lacks nay real flexibility and features so we opted to use stripe instead\n* Webmail - Would have been better if they offered us the ability to resell Google Workspace rather than webmail\n* Automated updates - they usually just break the site and their tool that is supposed to check and revert automatically is finicky.\n\nSo basically, I paid more leaving my last platform, and only about half of what I wanted works.\n\nI'd like to find a fast, reliable host, that makes managing this many sites super easy, without paying $30/mo per site like WP Engine wants.\n\nI debated on a VPS but administration just becomes more difficult in my prior experience.

There might be aspects I don't know how to design or implement yet, but if I feel like I can undertake them, it's ok. However, if I get the sense that I don't even know how to approach a specific problem, even after taking some time to research it, I don't continue.\n\nThen I try to establish from the beginning a general idea of how the website would look and feel by either creating a mockup or providing similar website designs. I'm only referring to structure/layout and functions, not visual style, colours, images, shadows, etc. I also don't spend that much time on this.\n\nI know some people tend to take weeks to establish even the mockup. I mainly talk with the person and kinda figure all this out that way. Usually I present a general idea and we talk about that specifically and make notes on it.\n\nAfter that, I try to come up with some questions regarding particular aspects that I think they might need in the future but are not foreseeing, because it's not their field.\n\n* Who uses the website. This is to get an idea of the audience, to be able to determine how detailed the UI elements, responsive design should be.\n* How old is the target audience. Younger people tend to adapt faster to (slightly) unusual design, so it gives me some room to play in with the visual style.\n* How used is the audience with this type of website. This tells me that they're used to seeing and using UIs, so I don't need to simplify forms a lot and things like that.\n* If the audience is mainly mobile or mainly desktop. I know the general consensus is that we should be building UIs mobile first, meaning that we should always assume that the mobile interface is more important than desktop, but that tends to leave desktop UIs a bit lacking. I want to optimise with the main target in mind and then scale in either direction.\n* And more which I can't think of right now.\n\nYou'll usually create this bullet point list on your own once you gather some experience. Generally everything that you're going to ask for at least a second project, you'll remember and it'll come up on the next project.\n\nDon't stress too much about creating a list like this either. Just ask what makes sense to you and it'll grow more useful with every project.",

Also alongside this, if the client has a website already then review all of his pages, content and make a mental note of what content needs to be on the page.\n\nWhen ready to create the design, either first structure it like a wireframe and get approval from the client before progressing, or if you feel confident in your abilities, begin adding the content to the website design and let your mind run free with creation.\n\n--* Ignore Below if you do not do development *--\nIf your a developer, I have found that it's best to reuse things you have created before. If for example the Web design needs a quirky image with text next to it and a ghost button, see if you have developed anything similar for a previous client, and if so create the design of that section around the design you have already built. This makes it more time efficient as you can just copy and paste the code which is fully responsive and needs minimal changes added to it. I used to design everything from scratch but I've come to realise, client A doesn't care if a section on his site looks like client B (who is in a completely different work industry), and once you change the colours and images around they most likely wouldn't even notice anyway.",

That increases the overall time for the project and I wouldn't be comfortable with that.\n\nAnother example, related to development more than design, would be something involving advanced algorithms. Algorithms are not my forte, so I wouldn't jump head first into building something like Pixlr, which at some point was branded as 'Photoshop in the browser'.\n\nAnother example would be something like the tools in Google Drive or Microsoft Office (online version). I simply haven't built interfaces that complicated, so I wouldn't prioritise finding a job like that, even thought I know that it would allow me to learn a lot and that I kinda know how to do anything inside Excel for example, but I just think the project is too large for a single person to undertake.",

So my process ends up being a bit more collaborative because they often have to make assets themselves.\n\n \n\n* 1. Contract Phase\n   * Jobs usually start with a conversation, often informal, where I get an elevator pitch for what they want. \n   * I then schedule a time to have a longer exploration conversation with them\n   * I have an intake form I either send to the client directly or fill in while we chat over a voice call\n   * If I can't immediately picture what they want and they're struggling to tell me, I ask them to build a mood board or send me inspiration images\n   * I also ask them to drop any current assets (logos, photos) they have into a  dropbox I set up for us. I usually request they give it to me in a \"layered file\" (Tif, PSD). Just saying \"Give me a PSD\" sometimes resulted in them giving me a flattened, unusable file.\n* 2. Wireframes Phase\n   * I draw up very basic greyscale wireframes in Figma and explain to the client that need to start with structure: what's in the site and where\n   * I either ask them to leave comments on the Figma directly or go over them with the client in a meeting, depending on their needs\n   * Around here is when I pick a font to use on the site with them. Fonts tend to be a good trial run of how much input the client wants, how they want to work with me, and how detail oriented they are. \n   * If we settle on a font I slot that in here as a stepping stone into..\n* 3. Medium Fidelity\n   * That's my weird term for \"roughs\" or when we start adding aesthetics like color and images.\n   * First I explain what these are to the client. \n   * Then that we do this so I can isolate problems the client doesn't know how to tell me about color, aesthetics, etc. \n   * I repeat a few polishing rounds, depending on project scope\n* 4. Launch Phase\n   * I used to call this \"final\" but websites are rarely \"done\" (and it stressed out some clients).\n   * When we're closer to launch I touch base with the client on anything that's changed since our first conversation in the contract phase. \n   * I do my final touches the client doesn't need spelled out for them (optimize images, bug fixes they don't notice, etc)\n   * I pack everything up into a big folder in our shared dropbox both for my reference and their archival use later\n   * Launch the site on agreed date.\n   * Email the client when done, pointing them to the backup of the files, asking them to check the site one final time (cause there's always something). \n   * I then keep a loose eye on it for a few days after launch, just in case. In the contract I lay out how long my support lasts for the site before it's a separate contract, but I feel like things only come up in the first 1-2 weeks after launch. \n\nAnd that should do it! Sorry if it's a bit long, but I've built this all up after years.",

Do the same for things that you require from the client and add sending and receiving it from the client to your overall checklist.\n\nAlso, one tip I love giving people and telling clients about is this.  Focus your content on AIDA. AIDA - getting their ATTENTION, getting them INTERESTED, arousing their DESIRE and getting them to ACT.\n\nTo do this and get your content right, you want to focus on your business benefits.  \n\nWhen you think of the business benefits, consider the feature of the business and then the benefit it provides, e.g. for a house/pet sitter it would be:\n\nWe will feed and play with your dog (feature) which means you can have a stress free holiday knowing your pet will be well looked after (benefit)\n\nWe will collect your mail and put out your bins (features) which means we not only care for your pet but your house is more secure as it looks like it's lived in (benefit)\n\nWhen you focus your clients website copy on benefits, the conversion rate is much higher than their competitors who simply list what their services are.  When you read a website like that it's uninspiring, you know you need that service, but you have to think for yourself when it comes to the benefits they bring.  If you TELL the website reader the benefits, they'll make a decision on the spot based on this, and are far more likely to sign up/buy your service.\n\nHope that helps!!",

Do this first, so everything is shaped around what makes the site work for them.\n2. **Learning** – Gather insights from analytics, existing traffic, marketing, and the current site. Learn what’s working, what’s not, and why.\n3. **Clarify Aim** – Define clear goals based on your audience and insights. I like one primary goal, a few supporting ones, and even “anti-goals” — things to avoid.\n4. **Hierarchy** – Map out the structure and navigation of the site. This can be a simple list or a full diagram. Expect this to evolve as your thinking develops.\n5. **Essential Features** – List out everything the site needs (e-commerce, CRM integration, etc.). Rank features by priority and tie them back to your goals.\n6. **Mapping** – Plan each page (or type of page): what it’s for, what’s on it, and how it contributes to your goals. I often work backwards from key pages like product or service pages — this helps shape the pages above.\n7. **Yield** – The final plan. Not just a brief, but a blueprint for the project: structure, features, and even tech choices. This helps with selecting developers, managing the build, and staying on track.\n\nMuch of the value is in the process — getting clarity, aligning goals, challenging assumptions, and forming a solid plan. We've refined this over years of projects, and it works. \n\nWe’ve wrapped it all up in a free guide called **ALCHEMY Website Planning** – just Google it to download. No catch. Just something that might save you time, money, and headaches.\n\nHappy to answer any questions if helpful 😊\n\nMarcus",

I have been coding HTML & CSS since the MySpace days (early 2000s) and have a degree in Media Arts with a concentration in Web & Interaction Design (what they called it before UI/UX was a thing). \n\nCurrently I work in quasi-government position as a Sr Web Designer. I create new pages in a CMS with a design system that was established before I arrived. I do *zero* design on the daily outside of the occasional new page. I sometimes help out by creating social media graphics. Most of my job is handling the relationship with our development vendor and maintaining content, reporting content, light QA, etc. My beef with my current situation is that I am more of a content editor and project manager than I am a designer. I am ultimately okay with this as I am pretty burnt out on designing in general. I'm burnt out on my role and after the latest review I am sure there is no upward movement. \n\nIn the past I have worked in eCommerce for a regional grocery store, insurance company, and national sports equpiment chain. \n\nI am at constant war with myself because I am both very creative and very analytical. I am burnt out on being creative unless the environment is very collaborative and engaging. I can no longer be in a silo. I like being data and task driven. \n\nAny tips on where to go from here? ",

In terms of workforce planning and monitoring, Bridgit Bench was also better because it's more flexible and could accommodate different types of projects in terms of size and duration which is what was lacking from LaborChart since it's more geared towards smaller and short-term projects. Bridgit Bench's automation features also gave it a big advantage as it saved us time and significantly reduced the risk of errors from manual data input. Lastly, the fact that Bridgit Bench came with an open API made it a lot easier for us as it allowed seamless integration with other tools that we already have especially Procore which is also one of the most commonly used tools in the construction business.  \n\nHere's where you can [read more](https://www.bridgitsolutions.com/bridgit-bench-vs-laborchart-comparison) about Bridgit Bench as well as a comparison between it and LaborChart, their unique features as well as the pros and cons of both software programs.",

A redirect is when an HTTP client asks for a resource and the HTTP server tells it to go to a different URL. In your case an HTTP client is asking for a resource and your HTTP server is saying *“sure, here is what you asked for”* and giving them a page that contains a program that, if ran, changes the location. So as far as an HTTP client is concerned, it asked for a page and got it, no redirect.\n\nYour HTTP response needs to be a 3xx status code with a `Location` header pointing to the new URL. Any client-side scripting isn’t a redirect in the eyes of an HTTP client – it just asked for a page and got one.\n\n> The only thing I couldn't do was redirecting via the header because of boring php/server configuration issues that prevent that.\n\n> Am I the only one dealing with this?\n\nMostly, yeah, because everybody else uses proper redirects. If there are “boring configuration issues” stopping you from doing that, then solve those issues.\n\n> Should I put the www. version as canonical, which is basically the web equivalent of neon-yellow bike pants?\n\nWhat do you mean by “neon-yellow bike pants”?\n\nThe `www` option is slightly preferable for a variety of reasons relating to cookies, DNS, recognisability by non-technical people, etc. But you shouldn’t switch just because you don’t want to solve your boring configuration issues – you’ll still have duplicate content with no redirect. Just solve the real problem properly.",

        "author": "TheTwelveYearOld",
        "id": "1he9cfl",
        "selftext": "Bidrectional as in, the app can show HTML & CSS as just 1-2 files and you can see edits on the HTML & CSS in the visual real time. *I get the feeling I'm describing something that already exsists but I didn't find it with my countless google searches*.\n\nI have done lots of searching about this while deciding on vector editors for personal use. Sure there are website builder tools like Framer and Webflow, but they're clearly branded as website builders, and they have different UIs. While I haven't actually used them beyond glancing at them, They have you choose components corresponding to HTML elements, rather than shapes / objects like Figma does. Besides being more popular, Figma seems to have a much smaller learning curve and lots of collaboration features. There are many open source vector editing tools but none I found that are meant to be an alternative to Figma and with bidrectional HTML + CSS.\n\nOften the designs created in Figma are converted into websites, I don't know how useful this would be why not have designers and developers use whichever tools best suit them and work in the same file formats? A wonderful thing about HTML + CSS are declarative layouts and designs in plain text so you can use any text editor or an IDE for feature like a side by side text and visual preview. A designer could just use the visual editing tool, and if they need advanced properties or layout options which aren't supported by said editor, then they could open a CSS text window up and write the layout properties there. Figma doesn't have equivalents of every single CSS property and doesn't let you write them.\n\nAnother benefit is having the designs as files stored on your device, while many apps can do this, Figma is purely cloud-based. Storing designs as plain text allows for saving file history with VCS tools like Git, which has a whole bunch of different tools for comparing versions, tags + branching, and platforms like Github support pull requests (while Figma has these, again why not have designers and developers use the same systems?). A designer could then utilize GUI git tools plus GitHub to collaborate and make pull requests.\n\nI find it bonkers that some SWEs out there have spent countless man hours into writing web UIs for tools like Figma that don't have bidirectional HTML + CSS previews. The designs are in proprietary file formats (or whatever is stored in the cloud), and developing the web UIs involves implementing the objects of those designs with a bunch of, you guessed it: HTML & CSS.\n\nFor personal vector editing I get the feeling that I should just write HTML & CSS in Vim (Neovim), which lets me navigate to and edit far away words in a document with only a few keywords (much much faster than moving a mouse around like in Word or Google Docs), which would be more productive for me than using any of these vector editing tools.",

They are rendered differently, operated differently abd there is no 1-to-1 mapping between them.\n\n\nSmall example. If I copy styles for our button from figma, it will always be 2 pixels larger. Why? Because in HTML+CSS borders actually occupy space, while most designers use inset border in SVG which doesn't do that. Simple example, but already your idea falling apart. \n\n\nAnd further we go - worse it will become. HTML is rendered responsive by default using User Agent styles (with some limitations and exceptions). Usually, when developers struggle to make something responsive, it's either design is crap, or developer broke that inherent property. SVG is not responsive in any way. It is scalable, meaning you take your image and can resize it however you like, but it is still same image confined in same viewbox. \n\n\nThen we have such a wonderful capabilities in CSS that allow us not to bother with precise sizing of blocks. They will occupy as much space as needed, wrap on new line and so on (again, unless you break something with crappy CSS). Then there are variables, transforms, etc.\n\n\nAnd most importantly, HTML have structure. In vector editor, you can move whatever you have wherever without bothering with a structure. If you do that in HTML, you will get unusable crap.\n\n\n\nIt is way simpler to either write HTML and CSS by hand from scratch, or use some WYSIWYG/sitebuilder to get proper result, rather than trying to turn SVG into usable valid HTML that looks the same _and_ behave like all different images (for narrow vewport, slightly wider viewport, wide viewport, etc).\n\n\nEdit: fixed incorrect statement about relationship between xml and html",

There is limited visual space; rendering an h1 tag on the screen is going to basically take one of the tweets off screen. Twitter wants people to log in, so the login UI needs to be there. So solution is hide the h1 tag: if a screenreader is running, it will tell a visually impaired user the context, but as it's only useful for those users, no need to render it for anyone else",

        "author": "zacholas321",
        "id": "wgqewc",
        "selftext": ">*“I’m charging twice as much per hour as I did at my pre-freelancing job and I’m working all the time. How TF am I bringing home* ***so little*** *per month?”*\n\nIf you’ve ever had a thought like this, you may benefit from optimizing for your effective hourly rate.\n\nMy goal with this post is to give you a framework for…\n\n1. Understanding what effective hourly rate *is* and why it matters\n2. Determining your **current** effective hourly rate\n3. Setting good goals & making better business decisions moving forward based on this lens for looking at how you get paid\n\n## What is effective hourly rate?\n\nIn case you haven’t heard the term before, “effective hourly rate” essentially means…\n\n>How much you *actually* make per hour ***after*** factoring in all the crap you have to do as a freelancer but don’t get directly paid for.  \n**= EFFECTIVE HOURLY RATE**\n\nCrap like…\n\n* Replying to a million Upwork posts to get one client\n* Sending invoices\n* Chasing clients to get paid\n* Doing prospecting calls\n* Prepping your stuff for taxes\n* Replying to emails\n* Leveling up your skills to stay relevant in the marketplace\n* Working on internal processes & systems for your business\n* Working on your website / portfolio\n* Managing staff\n* Copying files to that new computer you just bought\n\n## BIG-ASS DISCLAIMER\n\nThe “optimization steps” I recommend at the end of this post are what I’d consider more of a “late-stage, cushy life freelancer technique.”\n\nThat is to say, most of us start our freelancing careers perpetually broke and stuck in the cycle of always needing the next client, just to get the bills paid.\n\nIf this is you, I get it. I’ve been there.\n\nIt takes a long time to break out of that.\n\nAnd it f\\*cking sucks when you feel like you’re stuck there.\n\nBut if you stick with this freelancing thing long enough, always aiming to produce your best possible work, and trying to improve your skills with each new project…\n\nYou **will** break out of the cycle eventually.\n\nBut for today, that doesn’t change the fact that you’re stuck in it *right now*.\n\nSo when I talk in a bit about “optimization steps,” turning away certain types of work, etc. please remember to contextualize it for your situation and make the best decision for your current stage of business.\n\nMaybe you really *can’t afford* to turn away ***any*** business right now, regardless of how shitty the effective hourly rate is for it.\n\nIf that’s the case, no worries.\n\nKnowing where your time’s going and what work is most/least valuable will still helpful data for you to have.\n\nAccept that this is where you’re at *for now*, and perhaps put it on your mental list to kill that shitty low-effective-hourly-rate work as soon as you can afford to do so.\n\n## When effective hourly rate matters\n\nFor newbie freelancers / currently-employed peeps who see what the contractors at their company get paid, it can be easy to go like this when they see the hourly rates: 📷\n\n*(That’s meant to be a “envious eyes” emoji)*\n\nBut they don’t consider that it’s often the case that freelancers **only bill for about 1/3rd of the time their business takes them to run.**\n\nThis is why an often-recommended multiple when setting a freelance hourly rate is to **3x your job’s per-hour rate**.\n\nNone of this is ground-breaking, and I’ve seen it in about a million posts on Reddit and Quora.\n\nWhat I *really* want to talk about is…\n\n## *WHY* it matters\n\nEvery freelancer that’s ever existed wants to raise their rates.\n\nIt’s straightforward enough… More $ per hour = more $ in pocket. Sorted.\n\nBut I’d argue that it’s ***more important*** (or at least ***as*** important) to target improving your **effective** hourly rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause your life is finite, and chances are you’re doing a lot of stuff in your freelance business that you’d rather not.\n\nIf you can find optimizations that free up significant amounts of your time at little or no financial cost, you essentially get more life for free.\n\nBut optimizing for effective hourly rate can sometimes be somewhat sneaky and require more digging.\n\nLet’s look at an example.\n\nWhich of the following scenarios sounds better to you?\n\n### Scenario 1:\n\n* 12 separate projects this year, one per month\n* Each one will take \\~ 60 hours\n* Each one pays $6,000 (aka $100/hr)\n\n### Scenario 2:\n\n* 1 ongoing project contract for the whole year\n* Requires 60 hours time commitment per month\n* Pays $5,000 per month (aka $83.33/hr)\n\n### Which one’s better?\n\nWe’ll take a look SOLELY from an “effective hourly rate perspective.”\n\n*(Note that this example scenario is overly-simplistic and doesn’t factor in lifestyle preferences, working styles, etc.)*\n\nLet’s say you track all your time (exercise coming up) and any project you take on involves these “fixed time costs” for client acquisition:\n\n* 20 hours — Submitting Upwork proposals\n* 7 hours — Calls with prospective clients\n* 3 hours — Onboarding the new client, determining project scope, invoicing them, etc.\n\nThat 30 hours *has to happen* for every project, no matter the size.\n\nWhat this means is that in our “12 projects per year” example, we have a “fixed time cost” of 360 hrs/year (30 per project \\* 12 projects).\n\nWhereas the ongoing project has just the initial 30 hours.\n\nSpeaking *solely in terms of fixed time costs for client acquisition,* here’s how the total time commitment looks:\n\n### Scenario 1:\n\n* 12 separate projects this year, one per month\n* Each one will take \\~ 60 hours\n* Total gross paid for the year: $72,000 ($6k \\* 12)\n* Total time spent on the actual work over the year: 720 hrs (60 \\* 12)\n* Fixed client acquisition time costs for the year: 360 hrs (30 \\* 12)\n* **Total hours**: 1,080\n* **Effective hourly rate**: $66.67/hr\n\n### Scenario 2:\n\n* 1 ongoing project contract for the whole year\n* Requires 60 hours time commitment per month\n* Pays $60,000 per year ($5k \\* 12)\n* Total time spent on the actual work over the year: 720 hrs (60 \\* 12)\n* Fixed client acquisition time costs for the year: 30 hrs (30 \\* **1**)\n* **Total hours**: 750 hrs\n* **Effective hourly rate:** $80/hr\n\nSo even though from the outset, the first scenario appeared to pay better, when factoring in the effective hourly rate, the second scenario pays better.\n\n### Considerations & disclaimers\n\n>*“ZaCh, YoU’rE sO sTuPiD! What about if the client’s a pain and time consuming for the second project, or the multiple projects don’t take so much time to acquire, or \\[…\\]”*  \n**— UPSET READER**\n\nBefore you behead me, remember I disclaimed this was an overly-simplistic example.\n\nMy goal here isn’t to give you a guide on whether “more or less projects is better.”\n\nThat’s a whole can of worms and depends largely on what goals you’re most trying to target.\n\n(More money, more time, more freedom, less stress, etc.)\n\n## My goal here for you: A new lens for decision-making\n\nWith an eye on your effective hourly rate, you can make better decisions about what the ***true cost*** is to you to take on a project.\n\nSome examples…\n\n👉 If **every new client you work with** takes 3 unpaid hours to onboard, work with, etc., what would you need to charge for a *2-hours-worked project* to be worth it?\n\n👉 If a **certain type of work** requires 3x more un-billed communication time and only pays slightly better than a different type of work, *is it still worth pursuing?*\n\n👉 If you **really hate prospecting** and you can either burn 6 hrs per client or spend a couple hundred dollars per client acquired via paid ads linking to blog posts you wrote, which is better?\n\n👉 Finally feeling comfortable firing or charging more to that **super high-maintenance client** that takes unfair advantage of your time, after calculating how much per hour you’re actually making from their work.\n\n## Action steps:\n\nIf you want to calculate your effective hourly rate and optimize your business, here are the steps that have worked well for me…\n\n### ⏳ 1. Track ALL of your time & calculate your EHR\n\n**HOW:** You can track however you want; on paper, with a time tracking app, whatever.\n\n**HOW LONG:** Depending on your project pacing and schedule, it’s up to you how long it makes sense do this “track all your time” experiment for.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, **tracking all of your time for one month** is probably a good place to start.\n\nThe **most important thing** is that you categorize it appropriately into useful “buckets.”\n\n*(It’s going to be a bit of a pain to track all this if you’re not used to it, and it would suck if you had too few clearly-defined categories and missed out on some useful data.)*\n\nHere are some ideas; feel free to pick and choose what makes sense for your biz and add your own:\n\n* **Billable work** — Time you spend directly working on a project. I also like to sometimes break this down into subtypes to see where my hours go. (As a designer+dev, I might do “initial design,” “design revisions,” “coding,” “bug squashing,” “testing,” etc.)\n* **Prospecting – Outreach** — This would include cold email, Upwork proposals, etc.\n* **Prospecting – Sales calls** — I like to track this independently from the outreach time.\n* **Marketing** — If you do content marketing, I recommend breaking down into subtypes like writing, editing, etc.\n* **Existing client management / project management** — Talking/chatting with clients to keep projects moving along.\n* **Employee / contractor management** — All the time you spend managing your staff.\n* **Financial / Legal** — Doing your bookkeeping, etc.\n* **Administrative** — Answering random emails and whatnot. Sort of a generic catch-all.\n* **Misc** — The O.G. generic catch-all.\n\nNote that if you’re a toggl user like me, I **DO NOT** recommend using tags for these buckets, because you can’t generate pretty pie chart reports broken down by tag. (I learned this the hard way)\n\nInstead, for toggl users, I recommend that you create a new **client** for *yourself*, and then new **projects** for each of these “buckets” that belong to that client.\n\nI like to preface each of the project names with “ZS – ” (my initials) to group them and make them easier to pull up amidst all the client projects in there.\n\nExample setups of mine you can look at for reference:\n\n* [Here’s](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Toggl_EHR_Export.png) how I set up the buckets for my blog (client and project style)\n* [Here’s](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Toggl_EHR_Tags.png) how I set up the buckets for my web design freelancing (tag style; do not replicate)\n   * This was before I learned the hard way about tags — Your setup should structurally look more like [the one I did for my blog](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Toggl_EHR_Export.png) if you’re using toggl.\n\n### 📄 2. Make a list of your core values, along with work goals, likes, & dislikes\n\nDraw lines on a piece of paper to divide it into 4 quadrants. (Or print and [fill out this worksheet](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Optimizing-Your-Business-Based-on-Where-your-Time-Goes.pdf) I made)\n\n#### QUADRANT 1: CORE VALUES\n\nWhat are the **fundamental** things you value that your goals are oriented around?\n\nThese would be zoomed-out things like freedom, comfort, security, etc.\n\n#### QUADRANT 2: GOALS\n\nSpecific long-term goals with your business.\n\nThings like scaling it to be huge, or getting paid a lot and working part time to leave more time for underwater basket weaving, etc.\n\nDetermine if it’s more important for you to make as much money as possible, or re-claim as much time & freedom as possible.\n\nIf you value time & freedom more than money, I’d challenge you to do some budgeting and reflecting on your cost of living to determine your **target annual income**.\n\n(For me personally, as an expat living in a low-cost-of-living country with no kids, I target around $60-80k for my cost of living, savings, and investment goals. My #1 priority is time freedom, so having that $60k number in mind helps me decide what client work to take on vs. skip.)\n\n#### QUADRANT 3: WORK LIKES\n\nWhat are the specific tasks you most enjoy in your day-to-day work?\n\nFor me it’s the *actual deep work* like coding new features, designing, etc.\n\n#### QUADRANT 4: WORK DISLIKES\n\nWhat are the things you’d love to never do again if it were magically possible?\n\nFor me, it’d be prospecting, sales calls, bug squashing, billing, and convincing clients that my designs don’t actually *need* to go through another round of revision. 📷\n\n### 🔧 3. Optimize\n\nOnce you’ve tracked all your time for long enough and have lots of juicy data, it’s time to review that data alongside your lists from step 2.\n\nHow much of your time is un-billable and goes toward aspects of the job you don’t like?\n\nIs there a way that you can apply some creativity to your situation to minimize how much time you spend there?\n\nAre there certain types of projects you should or shouldn’t keep taking on?\n\nCertain structures in your business setup that should be changed?\n\nGoing through this exercise repeatedly over the years has been really valuable for me and has resulted in some dramatic changes in my business structure.\n\nA few changes I’ve made / wins I’ve personally had over the years as a result of this style of optimization (maybe they’ll give you some ideas)…\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n#### NO LONGER DOING SALES CALLS\n\nYoung Zach used to spend *hooooouuuuurrrsss* on sales calls trying to convince people that…\n\n1. Websites are good things to have, in general\n2. You should have me make yours\n3. You should pay me more than a pittance to do it\n\nThese days, I only jump on the phone once someone’s already seen a price estimate via email AND expressed interest in paying the amount quoted.\n\nThis means that by the time I jump on the phone with someone, they’re already pretty dang sure they want to work with me.\n\nMy conversion rate for “sales calls” (if you can call them that) at this point is upwards of 90%.\n\nDo I lose some business by quoting my price via email?\n\nYes, I’m sure of it.\n\nBut do I loathe spending 90 minutes on a Thursday night talking to someone who doesn’t convert simply because my services are out of budget?\n\nYou betcha; I loathe the shit out of it.\n\n**Quadrant Motivations:** 4\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n#### DOWN-SCALING MY AGENCY\n\nAfter evaluating how much time I was spending on project management and staff management – two of my least favorite types of work, btw – I made the decision to scale down my agency.\n\nI chose to go from a 3-person agency grossing in the $100-200k area to a solo-freelancer earning around $60-80k.\n\nCould I have maybe made it work it eventually and grown it to a multi-million-a-year agency?\n\nSure, maybe.\n\nBut yaknow what, I really just don’t like managing people.\n\nMost of the time, it seems like if you want a $1m digital agency, you need to employ like 30 or 40 people.\n\nWhereas there are plenty of entrepreneurs who run $1m product businesses with just themselves and a couple VAs. (I’ve worked with a few of them as their designer+dev)\n\n*I’ll take that one, please!*\n\nI decided I’d rather optimize for time freedom so that I can try to grow a product business, rather than try to grow a business reliant on managing a bunch of humans, which I really don’t enjoy.\n\n**Quadrant motivations:** 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n#### TURNING AWAY MOST CLIENTS\n\nEarlier this year, I went from working with a client every few months to doing ongoing work with one client.\n\nIt was a similar move to the agency down-scaling — another tweak to minimize un-billed prospecting time and onboarding time.\n\nBy working with this one client and doing little updates for past clients every so often, I can earn my same targeted \\~$60k a year working an average of 10 or so hours a week.\n\nThe client’s happy because it’s cheaper than hiring me at my regular rates for all that time spent, and I’m happy because I don’t have to do much outside of the work itself.\n\n**Quadrant motivations:** 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n## HBU?\n\nGo forth! Track! Tweak! Come back and tell me if you spot any cool optimizations or have any successes (or challenges) raising your effective hourly rate.\n\nDo you already have experience optimizing based on your effective hourly rate? How'd it go? What did you do to improve it? Anything I missed? Think I'm full of shit? Let me know!",

I did the website for a large company that’s almost like the “BBB for financial advisors.”  \nSimilar story to the first one: whenever a new advisor wants to strike out on their own, they learn pretty quick that they need a website. Who to hire?  \n“Oh, maybe the guy who made the website for that org that I just paid thousands of dollars to to tell me how to start my advisor business.”  \n👉 The takeaway here: both of my big “lucky referral breaks” came from getting an in with figureheads that others looked to when trying to get started.  \n😭 Where it’s challenging: It’s not always effective to reach out directly.  \nIn probably, idk, like 2012, I cold-emailed a big internet marketer dude who also lived in Colorado trying to hire him as a mentor and do some website work for him pro bono to get my foot in the door.  \n… Which I managed to secure.  \nI think he actually booked me for paid work eventually too. (But it was low-paying)  \nThe problem though, is that I was always working from that starting point of “working for free” and I don’t know of a really good way to start pro-bono for someone but have them want to pay top-dollar later.  \nIn hindsight, he also wasn’t a great fit because he was really active in the social media space. Social media marketing + telling people to use leadpages = no tie-in to need a site.  \nThe commonality with my two lucky breaks was that a core part of the recommendations they gave to their followers was “get a website,” and that they came as a result of a random related connection.  \n(For the big advisor org, I was referred to them by a client who helped advisors set up sites and often subcontracted dev work to me, and she was friends with the founder)  \nMy recommendation here for idea #4 stems from this one working so well, while attempting to address the challenge of the “cold outreach pro bono” thing.  \nIf you can create thought leadership content for a big thought leader that your niche clients look to for advice, it gives you all that borrowed credibility AND a foot in the door to later approach that thought leader with a partnership deal, i.e.  \n“Hey Blogowner, seems like people are really digging that article I wrote for you. I was thinking it’d be cool for us to launch a service together where we help people set up their first sites; happy to send you a kickback of $200 for each client you refer or white label it under your brand blahblahblah”",

        "title": "7 Apps I use to be more productive as a Web Developer",
        "author": "Bananas8ThePyjamas",
        "id": "n693wi",
        "selftext": "### Hey👋\n\nI’ve been using apps to boost my productivity for a while. For the past 3 years to be exact. This is the reason I’ve decided to share the ones that have broken into my daily routine and that will probably help you too. I know there are millions of apps that are supposed to increase your productivity and to be honest, I’ve tried a lot of them. After filtering if this app is useful enough, I have come to the 7 apps I cannot live without. I hope this saves you some time from researching everything!\n\n### 7. [Slack](http://slack.com/)\n\nIt’s not what you think! It’s actually not. I don’t use Slack to communicate with anyone. I am in some groups but that’s not the point. The point is that I use Slack to take quick notes. How? I make up new channels for each one of my projects and whenever I want to remember something related to a project I send it as a message. You’re probably wondering, why don’t you use some kind of fancy note-taking app, like Roam or Drafts. That’s because I find most note-taking apps cluttered, and not to the point, and others very simple for my liking.\n\n### 6. [Forest](http://forestapp.cc/)\n\nThis one is pretty obvious. I think. Pomodoro is one of the few scientifically proven methods to be more productive. For those not familiar with Forest, it is basically a fancy timer. You can set a work timer and a break timer. I usually do 40 minutes of work with 5 minutes of break. This can help you feel like you have something to anticipate. You can say to yourself “It’s just 24 more minutes of work. That’s not that much” and continue to be productive.\n\n### 5. [Newsify](http://newsify.co/)\n\nNext on the list is Newsify. You may not know what Newsify is, so let me explain. Newsify is an RSS reader, it basically gathers all the articles and blog posts from people you follow and displays them to you. This helps me keep up with the blogs that I want to follow, without having to look up every single one. I used to use Feedly, but I prefer the interface of Newsify 100x times more.\n\n### 4. [Mist](http://usemist.com/)\n\nIn short, Mist is a Chrome Extension that helps you practice mindfulness without fully detaching from your work. Every few hours, I will do a simple Body Scan Meditation, because I have found that I am more productive that way. I prefer Mist rather than all the other mindfulness apps because it is built into Google Chrome. I got access to it a couple of weeks ago because they currently have a waitlist, but it's a tool that I use every day.\n\n### 3. [Asana](http://asana.com/)\n\nAsana is my one-stop project manager. I use it to do everything from tracking progress on projects to writing down deadlines. I discovered this software about 3 months ago and it has really changed y workflow. You can organize your projects in a calendar or tasks view, but I personally use the calendar for almost everything. It is very easy to plan out what you have to do on a day-to-day basis for every project.\n\n### 2. [Superhuman](http://superhuman.com/)\n\nSuperhuman is one of those apps where you don’t think it’s that useful at first, but you can’t live without it. Simply, it is a fancy email app. They claim to help you get through your emails in 2x the time, and I find that to be true. They also helped me declutter and organize my inbox which is a big thing if you take into account my 21.000 unread emails. Yes. 21.000. After all that, I am proud to announce that I’ve hit the fabled Inbox Zero.\n\n### 1. [Notion](http://notion.so/)\n\nHave you ever googled anything related to productivity? Then you have probably come across Notion. Notion is an amazing note-taking app in which you can organize… your whole life. I use Notion to keep track of my Reading List. I write down every book I get recommended and when I have time, I listen to them on Audible. I also have my goals and weird trips I want to do in there. If I listed everything, this article would be a book, so let’s move on. You can use the app in every way you like, as it’s super customizable.\n\nThanks for your time!",

I use them to plan and do my work. I also go for lots of walks and go jogging and cycling. Work will get done when it gets done. If I had some timer going off every 45 minutes I would throw whatever device it was running on out the window, immediately boosting my productivity. \n\nSide note - Productivity culture is marketing pseudo- science that makes people feel \"productive\" because it gets them thinking about \"productivity\". We are human beings, not robots, and we should not judge ourselves our others by our \"productive output\". Furthermore, no app or technique is \"scientifically proven\" to make anyone more productive. Because there is no agreed upon definition of productivity nor is there an agreed upon metric with which to measure it. If someone were to say standing on your head for ten minutes a day boosts productivity by 20%, how would you go about disproving that? It's an unfalsifiable claim. Productivity \"science\" was invented to sell books. If it works for you great, but don't fall for marketing.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys-\n\nWhen designing a Hero for a new webpage- a Homepage for example. How is the image for the Hero feature supposed to scale with the various screen sizes?\n\nIs it supposed to shrink/expand with the window, or auto-resize with the window. Ie; for example I'm designing for a PC screen (various sizes), Tablet, and Mobile.\n\nAre these three separate image designs for the Hero, which all load differently depending on the device?\n\nI understand scaling the image from a browser, which shrinks with the window movement (mostly). But am I just adding the device to the Div when implementing?\n\nI apologize if this is a stupid question. I just want my hero image to scale properly, and it either gets cut-off when the window shrinks, or looks messed up on smaller devices. Any insight would be appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: After review, the easiest way to optimize images, and content in general, is to use a CDN (content delivery network). I'm sure something similar can be accomplished directly within the codebase, as many external libraries are, however- I'm seeing many advantages to researching and finding the right external library for your needs. Here's the latest snippet from my project notes.   \n\n\n**I think we're on the right track optimizing images and hosting content using the Cloudinary library. I like that they handle the respsonsiveness of the images, and they have AI for things like generating image tags, optimizing size/ scale/ etc. They also have compatibility for video, and various other content strategies. Using a CDN (content delivery network) alleviates the responsibility of having to manage this content from within the codebase itself. While it is another library to learn, we can soft-launch using Cloudinary and gradually expand on how we're using this platform to optimimze performance. Additionally, we can continue our research and evaluation of CDN's in general, ie; bunnyCDN which seems to be growing in popularity, and whereas pricing will become an important factor as content on our website continues to grow.** ",

I have a concept I need someone to code (a sort of a quiz site where you rack up points), does anyone know any other good site or places to look for these people?\n\nThanks!",

I think you should collect portfolios and sample of work from Developers and short list a couple of them and connect with them. What I feel is equally important is to actually make sure that the person is a good human being who you are about to work with. You can figure that out by asking them questions like -\n\n- Why did you choose this profession over anything else?\n- Is it just for the money or you have passion for the business?\n- Where are you seeing yourself in the next 5 years?\n- How can you help in removing poverty from the world ?\n- Are you associated with any Charity for helping the needy?\n\nI mean anything that tells you about how this person is from the inside out and trust me, if you can find a reliable, honest and trustworthy Developer to work with you, you will not be looking back ever. He will value your time, efforts and money altogether and give you more than what you expect from him. Being a Developer myself, I have learnt this from my previous clients that I have worked with. Some of them are award winning business owners as well, who ran BIG Steel Companies in the past.\n\nP.S If you are still looking for a Website Developer, please let me know as I am available to take up some new projects.

I have always believed that unless someone is a great human from the inside out, they are not going to value the time you are investing with them, which is really not a good thing to happen with anybody. You can make a post here and ask for portfolio and then try and talk with them to know more about them and hopefully you will end up finding the best suitable guy or girl for your job.\n\nP.S Incase if you are looking for a Website Developer or Graphic Designer for any of your projects, please let me know, I would love to work with you on your projects.",

Maybe there's additional padding. Maybe there's a margin issue. Just move up the hierarchy of elements and you'll figure it out.\n\nTwo: bootstrap is basically container > row > columns. The container will center the content on the page, the row will set your basic view, and the columns hold your content. I typically build my pages with multiple containers so that I can apply full page backgrounds. You probably don't need that here but experiment.\n\nAnd finally: get familiar with all the different bootstrap components. It also helps to inspect the code on their examples to see how they built it.\n\nGood luck!",

        "id": "tise68",
        "selftext": "Sometimes you have a large css file for your home page depending on the size of the project, and it turns out it ends up render blocking the page.  So to combat this, I found a code snippet to defer loading of your css files here:\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/path/to/my.css\" media=\"print\" onload=\"this.media='all'; this.onload=null;\">\n\nWhat you do, is take the code that you need for your landing page section above the fold, copy and paste it into a separate css file and call it critical.css (you can use whatever you want, that's what I chose). Then remove that css from the main style.css or whatever it's named.  Add that critical.css to your head, and add the file path of your main css sheet in place of the href in the code I have above, and delete the link tag that contains the original style.css\n\nSo instead of your link tags looking like this\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/style.css\">\n\nIt will look like this\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/critical.css\">  \n <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/style.css\" media=\"print\" onload=\"this.media='all'; this.onload=null;\">\n\nBy removing only the parts you need to load the styles above the fold (meaning everything that is on the screen when the site loads), and placing them in their own css file to load, and defer loading the css for the rest of the page until the page loads, you are fixing your css sheet from render blocking the page load. You're only loading what you NEED to load, and deferring the rest.  \n\nYou can do this for external libraries too.  Like I use the Animate on Scroll library to make on scroll animations, but its css cdn is also a render blocking resource, so I place that in the defer link and it still works normally without render blocking the page. Like so:\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.css\" media=\"print\" onload=\"this.media='all'; this.onload=null;\">\n\nThis a a great trick to help push the limits of your load times. Doing this got me from a 98-99 to a nice 100 more consistently on larger sites.  I've tried this out of a few of my sites already and it boosted all their page speed scores to 99-100's. Hope this helps!  Thought I'd share what I found.",

We're looking for a designer who can look at the issue from both an artistic and technical perspective, **not a coder**.  I assume there is some professional out there who specialized in this type of design. We'll build whatever the final design is on our own systems, which might be a rebuild of the current system or something completely new to us - so the frontend/backend system is irrelevant at this point. \n\nI'm an admin and am familiar with the B2B/B2C concepts, but it is difficult to describe the role of our website. The explanation I usually use is  : \n>We are a theoretical automobile manufacturer named \"Ford\" and we want to sell our cars and trucks. We don't really sell directly to the end customer, we sell through local car dealerships and other intermediaries. But, we still need to market to the end customer as well as the dealers and intermediaries.  \n>\n>We have a few different 'profiles' we use for our product pages. One for passenger cars, one for sports cars, one for passenger trucks, one commercial trucks. They are all similar but have a few differences. Our product pages pull info from our API and display it according to the profile design. \n*(We do not manufacture or sell cars and definitely are not Ford. This was just used as an example. Please don't sue us)*\n\nWhat we are looking for is a new profile design. We want the design to be backed up by rationale other than SEO although that needs to be a part of it, of course. The ultimate goal is sales, but the focus is not on closing the sale or eCommerce. Get the customer's attention, help the salespeople quickly find information they need to close a sale, provide detailed specification without drowning the casual visitor in technical information.\n\nThe designs we have previously used have all been created by graphic designers who focused on print material, marketers focused on SEO, or an internal team who essentially cloned a common design used by competitors. We might end up doing the same thing again, but we've reached a point where it makes sense to at least try to do something unique and different. Before we go crazy and throw all the crazy designs we can find on Dribble or Codepen on the page, we thought it would be a good idea to hire someone who knows what they are doing to help us come up with a good design.\n\nThanks for your input by the way.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR - We want to help people learn ML/UI/UX/WebDev by building an impactful side-project together. We intend to personally call each team on a weekly basis to discuss progress and next steps. It’s all free and you keep everything you make. Fill out the form below if you’re interested! For those who prefer video: [https://youtu.be/pZQcJufsTkA](https://youtu.be/pZQcJufsTkA) \n\n## Introduction\n\nFirst, a short update to [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/geuukb/want\\_to\\_learn\\_ml\\_by\\_applying\\_it\\_to\\_games\\_ill/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/geuukb/want_to_learn_ml_by_applying_it_to_games_ill/) . In essence, we’ve done this before with 5 individuals who were the first Chronic Coder Academy (CCA) Fellows. We called them for 30 minutes each week to go over the details and action items for their side-projects. We started in June 2020 and just wrapped up their awesome applied ML projects a month or two ago. They’re amazing in their own right so I won’t take any credit for their success but since June, 3 of them have new jobs, 1 just started college and is working with an ML professor and the last is working on finding a job outside his home country (so his goals are more long term but we’re actually working on a different project together now).\n\nOur focus then was strictly on Machine Learning projects applied to games. The projects were done solo and the fellows mainly focused on building their ML skills. However, we’ve learnt that there is a ton of value in working as a team and also a lot of opportunity in the program for people with different skill sets to learn from too. Hence, we’re reaching out to this subreddit along with other related web development and machine learning subs to gather a better team composition this time around. I’ll expand on all this soon.\n\n## Who\n\nI’m Christopher Kok, a research software engineer at a large aerospace company focused on applying Machine Learning to various problems within aerospace. At work, I also run the ML/AI community of practice (leading some of the most attended events company-wide that focus primarily on fostering a better understanding of ML). In my free time, run a Youtube Channel (called Chronic Coder) that focuses on applied ML advice. I also cover a lot of my own fun side-projects to do with applying ML to online games.\n\nJoining me is my friend, Ignacio (Nacho) Raposo. He has nearly half a decade’s worth of applied ML experience and is the former COO of an AI consulting firm (Lugus-Intelligence) that focuses on projects solving problems in mainly industrial domains (from industrial mining to internet of things). His main role there is client/project management and strategy, but I’d say he’s one of the best people I know when it comes to understanding state of the art ML research and applying that to whatever problem it is that needs solving. \\[[https://lugus-intelligence.com/english\\_team.html](https://lugus-intelligence.com/english_team.html)\\]\n\nWe both specialize more in the ML sphere, as you can tell, but we both have worked with other professionals in web development and user experience while having done some ourselves too. We hope to bring that to the table. Honestly, beyond that, we hope the program will help build the skills you seek while working together regardless of our guidance.\n\n## What\n\nIn short, we want to pull people together and create 2-5 teams that will develop their own ML based side-projects while we supervise and call each week to discuss action items. Although the app itself will be ML based, there’s a lot to do and gain from the web dev and UX side of things too. Also, the theme will no longer just be game based, we’d love to hear what problems you’d love to solve in general! The more real-world the problem is, the better.\n\nThis time round, I want to try implementing some stricter guidelines. The primary focus is still on learning through developing whatever we can. However, we’ve learnt that we could do better with some set deadlines and goals to hit. I’ve recently written out some guidelines here for a proposed process based on our past experience and a few books on ML apps and project management that I’ve read: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-M6nxeLnIaFufS-u2Ymp45AYB9eEmVHZno7G2F545U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-M6nxeLnIaFufS-u2Ymp45AYB9eEmVHZno7G2F545U/edit?usp=sharing). If you prefer a video format: [https://youtu.be/Vsef5E4hzYw](https://youtu.be/Vsef5E4hzYw). \n\nLike I mentioned, we’re mainly focused on ML and PM there too. Hopefully by working with more and more people with diverse skill sets we can build up a guideline that outlines useful steps for Web Developers and UI/UX folks too. It’s rough and still open to change, so let me know if you have specific comments or concerns. To be honest, I’m sure it will change anyway throughout the course of this next phase.\n\nSome high-level details:\n\n* Teams of 1 Designer and 2 programmers (one ML and one Web Dev)\n* Overarching goal is to ship in 6 weeks (more information on tasks each week defined in the doc/video above) \n* Quick team meeting each week to go over progress, discuss issues, and plan next steps\n\n## How \n\nYou can sign up here: [https://forms.gle/jLtqCbLCJnsChKJe6](https://forms.gle/jLtqCbLCJnsChKJe6) \n\nWe will begin the selection process shortly (last time it took us about a week). What I said in my previous post stands true (with some minor modifications to include UX/webdev folk):\n\n“This is targeted at people who care about making something impactful and also want to learn more through application. Your age, race, gender, ethnicity, etc mean nothing to me but you have to be passionate about what you do and hopefully converse well enough in English. Everything you make is completely your own, no matter how much advice or guidance we end up giving. Oh and also, it’s completely free (before anyone asks). I’m really in this to better expose myself to different applications and ideas plus I truly enjoy watching people learn; especially from interesting use cases.”\n\n## When \n\nMy goal is to start in the first week of November and end just before the Christmas season consumes our joyful souls.\n\n## Why\n\nTeaching through application has been one of my most fulfilling life goals and I hope I get to continue that here.

        "selftext": "# So the title seem slightly misleading.\n\nTo be clear, the job I am applying for is a Web Developer Intern. This position detailed that it expects the candidate to be enrolled in a Bootcamp or perusing a degree in Computer Science. I am currently learning through Codecademys career path ( full-stack engineer). They do not expect the candidate to feel comfortable with basics like html, CSS,  JavaScript, and PHP as they will be learning throughout the internship. This sounded like a perfect opportunity for me, mainly because I  have been practicing all of the above and would like some actual working experience.\n\nDuring my interview I explained that I have used all of the following and am growing comfortable, however I was pursuing the internship to build my skills and get some real working experience. They explained that the internship is 10 weeks and they usually look to move the candidate from internship into a position after they have completed the bootcamp or degree. (This all sounded great, if I could land this internship I could focus on what this company utilizes and grow my career with them over time)\n\nI got a call back and was offered a second interview. They asked when I would be done with this bootcamp ( I let them know a few weeks). They then offered me a second interview , but as a software engineer not an Intern. Based on our first interview they decided a better fit would be this route rather than the internship.\n\nI accepted the interview, and have dedicated these next few weeks to finishing my bootcamp + some interview prep. This is exciting however I feel vastly underprepared as I am still not as comfortable with other things like Databases or how to use react effectively.\n\n# My questions:\n\n* What do you think the purpose of skipping the internship altogether and considering me for a software engineer role?\n* Do I have a real chance to land this job?\n* Should I end the interview stating that the internship was what I initially wanted and would still like to be considered if not offered this role?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# A few extra details:\n\n* I sought out the Talent Acquisition Manager, and reached out directly. (They introduce their team on the website.)\n* During the zoom interview I had a great conversation, and expressed a lot of interest.\n* I did not embellish my skills, however I am afraid that saying I am growing comfortable was mistaken for I have great comfortability in the basics.\n* I have built a website for a family friend, this was initially created vanilla but updated to get practice on a few recourses. I did update page with Bootstrap (But only for framework practice, connected an API through Google Places for live reviews, and PHP for form submissions to an email.\n* Any additional portfolio pieces I have came with a great help from google.\n* At this time, I am not sure I will be able to quickly, or confidently answer any questions thrown at me without this help.\n* I am extremely passionate and self motivated.",

        "author": "kyletsenior",
        "id": "jy8mg2",
        "selftext": "Maybe it's just me, but I keep running across websites that have international and localised versions that seem to be trying their hardest to get me to *not* use their site.\n\nFor example, a manufacturer of a specialised piece of industrial equipment. I found the product through a google search and see it's probably what I've been looking for. But then I get an annoying popup in the middle of the screen suggesting I go to the localised version of this site instead of the international version. If I click yes to get what you would (presume) is better more localised information, you would think it would take me to the localised version of that product page. But no, most of the time it will take me to the homepage of the localised version instead of that thing I want's page. \n\nWho the fuck actually designs such a thing and goes \"ah yes, this is better!\". I cannot grasp why anyone would think this is a good idea. And to top it off, websites sometimes take your \"yes\" as a licence to redirect you to the localised version in future making it hard to go back to where you were. Now I have to delete cookies.\n\nSimilarly is the tendency now to redirect people to the home page if anything goes wrong on an online shop. Big local Australian hardware chain comes to mind. I try to go to the product page of something I needed and found a few days ago, but now it redirects me to the homepage. No explanation, it just does it. What I suspect is the product has been discontinued, but can't be sure.\n\nMaybe it's a manager thing instead of a web designer thing.",

Apologies in advance as I'm not a web designer, but I'm currently working as part of a web redesign project and we're struggling to communicate with our dev about how the banner image in the header should behave when the page is scaled.\n\nThe website our graphic designer made is designed to have a banner image where the full **height** of the image is always visible, and any cropping happens on the left and right side equally.\n\nMeanwhile our dev keeps coding a page where the full **width** of the image is always visible. This means that cropping when scaling is happening at the top and bottom equally, which is what we don't want.\n\nNot sure I'm doing a great job of explaining this, so we can't seem to get it resolved. I'm struggling to find anything on Google because I'm pretty sure I'm not even close to using the right terms, so I'm not finding the right answers.\n\nI was wondering if there was a correct or an industry-standard term for this type of behaviour/property?\n\nEDIT:\n\nWe've managed to find an example in the header image here:\n\n[https://www.kingswood-honda.com/](https://www.kingswood-honda.com/)\n\nLooking at this example, it looks like it does crop in both directions, but only one way or the other (not both at the same time).

The way the banner is set up, probably with a maximum height, it actually _does_ get \"wider\" than the images on really large/wide screens. To get around this you would have to base the height of the banner on the page width, to make sure the _aspect ratio_ of the banner is never wider than that of the image.\n\nYour images look to have a height equaling about 26 % of their width, so you could set the minimum height of the banner to be `26vw`, meaning 26 % of the page width. This would make the banner grow in height on very wide screens, to make sure that the images don't have to be cropped.",

Also, it seems like the sort of thing one couldn't do without some programming, although I suppose it's not impossible for a WordPress plugin to exist which handles this. However, here's what I think the approach would look like.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there are two parts to the problem: responding to updates to the spreadsheet, and working with the sheet data. The Google Sheets API supports downloading the content of a spreadsheet page. I've done this on static sites by getting an API key, sharing the page, and putting together a URL where the sheet data could be downloaded. Every time the static site rebuilds, it fetches the spreadsheet data and generates new content based off it. If hosted on Netlify and paired with Zapier, it could be used to trigger a site rebuild when the spreadsheet is updated. \n\nI don't have very much experience with WordPress, and even less with its internals, but I suspect there would be a similar flow of data and events when doing this: \n\n>Zapier detects spreadsheet update --> Zapier sends a request to the website to signal a change in content --> website fetches the spreadsheet data and updates things accordingly\n\n  \nOne possibility off the top of my head, though, is setting up a tiny static site which does this, hosting it off Netlify, and including it on the WordPress site inside an iframe.",

No one begins a new project with it these days\n* *If* you want to use something like Bootstrap, use Tailwind instead. You may not need either though\n* When choosing a frontend framework: for maximum hirability choose React and for maximum 'riding the future trend' choose Svelte. If you have reasons for Vue and Angular though, go for it— this choice isn't like getting a tattoo and swearing allegiance like many will have you believe\n* Every time you do a tutorial or two, make sure you practice it by building something little with what you learned.

Also you have height 100% on your body, which I recommend removing at first.\n2. screwing images or divs is sometimes a bit tricky, because you have to position the elements properly. The main reason why the text is not visible is, because your images have position: absolute; what you want here is that the text is absolute and the image relative. Make sure you wrap the image and the text into a container which is relative. After that you can use something like: position: absolute; top: 50%; left:50%; transform: translate(-50%,-50%); to position the text in the center of the wrapping div.\n3. Do you mean, that the text does not slide? So it always stays fixed in the middle? If that's the case you need a container that is wrapping your swiper and have your text absolute above it, same as with the images in point 2\n\nQuick tip: if you use .ui.grid as your wrapping container always make sure to use . column inside otherwise you screw up your positioning. The column padding is kind of reverting the minus margins in .grid. (Don't want to go to deep on that, it has reasons) They only work together. If you do not want any column elements, just use another wrapper class.\n\nI hope that I was able to help you. Happy coding.  \n\n\nedit: typo",

The point of a font is that all the characters consistently look the same all the time, everywhere, so the font is not \"rendering differently\" on different OSes. That's just what it looks like. What's actually happening is the OS has substituted a different font because the original was not available to it.\n\nProbably what happened is you tried to view a document with a font on a machine that didn't have that font installed. This happens when you try to transfer MS Word or raw design files to different people. Even if the machines have the same OS, if their installed fonts are different, the OS will substitute a 'similar' font. Instead, you need to use export formats like .pdf, .png, .jpg, etc. rather than raw files like .docx, .ai, .psd etc.\n\nOn the web, it works the same. The web page determines the fonts via CSS. If a machine doesn't have the font, it substitutes another one according to the list the developer creates. That list is called a font stack, and it holds all the fonts in the order they should be tried. The last item on the list is a generic one and each OS has its own generic font for the different kinds (i.e. serif, sans, mono, etc.).\n\nGoogle fonts and custom fonts include the font files in the web package, so if users don't have it on their machines, it's still available to use and the fonts don't fallback to others in the stack. In this case, you either link to a place the fonts live on the web, or link to a place they live on your server. This will ensure that all users see the same font.\n\nBasically your boss has sent you on a wild goose chase because they don't understand how fonts work.\n\nIf the document is distributed in an export format, or the webpage is properly built, all users will see the same font regardless of what OS they use.",

        "author": "ybouane",
        "id": "nn8rj1",
        "selftext": "Hey redditors,\n\nWhat is you stack? I think it would be nice to see what tools web designers are using in their workflow nowadays.\n\nI develop no-code websites and these are my go-to tools that I use almost everyday (non-exhaustive of course):\n\n# [Photopea](http://photopea.com/)\n\nPhotoshop for free and on the web. I'm actually subscribed to Photoshop CC but its super slow and laggy on my computer so I often end up opening a tab and just use photopea instead. A super handy tool especially if you ever want to quickly edit a picture and don't want to open Photoshop (and wait 1min for it to open).\n\n# [Sktch.io](http://sktch.io/)\n\nYou may have heard of Webflow and [Bubble.io](http://bubble.io/), I've been using them in the past, but recently started using [Sktch.io](http://sktch.io/) as my main website builder. The great thing about it is that in addition to the frontend features I was used to with Webflow/Bubble, it provides much more in terms of backend and frontend interactions. I can't count how many times, I would start a project with Webflow and end-up hiring a developer to add a simple feature. With sktch, I can develop those features with a modular/visual system directly in the editor.\n\n# [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)\n\nThese fonts are free for commercial use and they are web-ready. Many platforms support them natively, but whenever I am trying to find a font for a specific title or website I'm creating, I head to [fonts.google.com](http://fonts.google.com/), increase the font size and start filtering the fonts to find the perfect one for my use-case.You can also download the fonts in TTF formats (by going to the project's Github) if you want to use them locally in Photoshop/Illustrator for example.\n\n# [Flat ui colors](https://flatuicolors.com/)\n\nYou probably use a different palette tool, but this one is my personal favorite. A few colors available in a few \"styles\". Simple and effective. I hate going through color palette tools that overwhelm me with options.\n\n# [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)\n\nPage load speed is super important for SEO and for user-experience. Google PageSpeed Insights is a great tool for finding bottlenecks in your website, maybe an image you are using is too large and you could save a few KB by choosing a more appropriate size, or maybe your text doesn't have enough contrast which lowers it accessibility.PageSpeed is a great tool for detecting these common mistakes and thus improving UX.\n\n# [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com)\n\nMy mailing list service of choice. It's very easy to link Mailchimp with [Sktch.io](http://sktch.io/) and use tags when people subscribe to your website.Mailchimp also has great automation tools allowing you to create a cool onboarding experience for your users/subscribers.\n\n# [Zapier](https://zapier.com)\n\nTo be honest, I haven't use Zapier extensively so far, but it is an automation tool that you can use to run tasks. You can use Zapier to detect events happening in an app to trigger actions on a different app for example. Zapier is a great tool for linking different services together and build a \"backend\" for your website/service.\n\n# [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) / [Behance](https://behance.net)\n\nWhen doing creative work, it's of course important to find inspiration and these tools are great for that. In addition you can showcase your work there and build a portfolio which is great for getting clients!\n\n# [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)\n\nWhile Dribbble and Behance are great for getting inspiration in terms of design/ui/ux, ProductHunt is great for finding project ideas. It's also a great tool to see what ideas end up working (getting traction) and those that don't.\n\n# [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)\n\nA popular icon pack distributed as a font. Very handy as you don't have to juggle with hundreds of svg files (it helps with page loading as well to pack everything in a single file). Of course these icons are not the fanciest, they are single-tone (dual-tone is available for PRO users) so it's mostly useful for small icons used for ui stuff.\n\n# [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/)\n\nA huge collection of icons (free & premium) of various styles that will meet your needs. Attribution is required unless you subscribe to the premium version. Make sure to read their FAQ for knowing how you can use the icons.\n\nLet me know how that compares to your own stack!",

Nullam sollicitudin ornare sem, ac **mollis** sem tristique non. Pellentesque ut diam in **magna** efficitur pharetra viverra id justo. Duis eget **pretium** lorem. Maecenas congue nec elit ut blandit.\n\nLet's assume that the bold words are underlined words (I can't figure out how to underline in stackoverflow). The text is written by somebody else and it's not fixed, which means I can't actually tell them to add whenever they need something underlined (I can ask them to add the though).\n\nI ended up using this\n\n    u {     \n        text-decoration: none;     \n        background-image: linear-gradient(to right, white 100%, transparent 50%);     \n        background-position: 0 1.04em;     \n        background-repeat: repeat-x;     \n        background-size: 1px 1px; \n    }\n\nWhat could be another approach for this? This approach is not responsive, I have a text that is underlined and it has pretty big letters, so when I resize, the phrase 'wraps' itself, but the underline does not (it's a background image).\n\nI appreciate any help/suggestion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit.

Google Ad words advert (nice to have, not earning much anyway)\n3. plugin to track feedback (important to inform funders etc) - auto generated at the bottom of posts.\n4. theme elements - tags and suggested posts.\n5. blank space before footer\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0spapviade61.jpg?width=1620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=797b9225649b1fb73d70013991c06985b533a288\n\nwhat I would like to do is put my ad (2) into the blank space (5) - I know this doesn't optimise positioning etc, but that's not my aim with the website so i'm not bothered.\n\nI think the solution is to create a widget space under the theme elements and then add in my HTML code as I normally would for a widget area. For reference the theme is hueman.\n\nHowever, I don't know how to do this and have no CSS knowledge. Can anyone suggest a work around?",

        "selftext": "I'm looking for a conference website solution with a working backend. A WP theme is preferred. The website needs to:\n\n1. Collect call for speaker submissions (abstracts) along with bio info from possible speakers. Then that data can be graded and selected to present or not. Preferably, emails to the submitters can be auto generated based on if they are selected or not. \n2. Allow admins to easily generate and manage a conference agenda based off of who has been selected and what time and room they are assigned. \n3. Allow users (selected speakers) to create and account with a code or link, so they can log in and submit their headshot, update their session abstract (which is live on the agenda page), submit a PowerPoint file, etc. \n4. Take registrations (using Strip or Square) and send auto confirmation to attendees. \n\nWe had a site built using Angular several years ago and have enough HTML and CSS experience to manage it ourselves, but there is no backend and having to manually format the speaker agenda (dozens of abstracts and headshots) by hand in HTML is a pain. \n\nWe hired someone to rebuild the website (same look, we love the design) into a WP template in the hopes that we can just copy/paste the abstracts from our collection form into WP. We can do this, but the site is clunky with many many boxes to edit. \n\nAt this point, we are looking for another solution. I looked on EnvatoMarket for themes with working backends. They have them for other things (online classes, job boards), but nothing for managing conference/events. I tried Google also and could not find something that was suitable. \n\nIt has to have a backend to make the day-to-day website management easier. Does anyone know of a solution to something like this?  We are looking for a prebuilt solution that we can customize.",

Being able to mentally filter out divs to the background to easily skim for the text I'm looking for only has value to me if I somehow forget CTRL+F exists for searching text. For actually working in the file, once you scroll down and all you see is \n\n              </div>\n              Some Text\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\nI don't know any web developer who would objectively consider that a better experience. I don't know what the hell any of those closing divs represents unless I scroll back up. Or I'm just wasting time collapsing and expanding divs constantly to try and keep the flow in my mind without scrolling back and forth.\n\nUsing the right semantics also helps me search, i.e. if I see <section> or <article> being used, and I'm looking to modify something in the start of every <section>, I know I can jump from <section> to <section> quickly",

By far. \n\nThe identical div tags line everything up nicely and the flow from the section titles down is both easy to parse and easy to imagine. \n\nThe first one doesn’t line up anywhere near as nicely and it has a lot of additional tags that provide any particular impact in visualizing the page and how it flows. \n\nI’d also suggest the second example contains a number of extraneous tags that provide no function in the visualization of the page, but because they’re perfectly aligned & identical tags, it’s easier to gloss over them, which actually helps draw the eye to the actual page contents within the tags and how they flow and fit together visually on the page. \n\nThe second example is clean and reminds me of the old HTML sitemaps of the 90s. \n\nThe first example is a lot busier. There’s a lot more vying for my attention than just the elements that’ll be visually rendered on the page & meant to draw my attention. \n\nIf I had to navigate that site by the code alone (since both are visually identical when rendered), I would definitely prefer the second one. \n\nThe div tags fade into the background, leaving just the meat & potatoes, structured in an intuitive and obvious manner, making it really easy to see what everything is and its role on the page.",

Think about what you’re asking and who you’re asking it of. \n\nBots, like screen readers & web crawlers, appreciate the context provided by the tags in the first example. \n\nBut you’re not asking bots—you’re asking people. \n\nAnd, for people looking at the code, the uniformity of the tags in the second example allows the tags to fade into the background, while, in the first example, they become distracting visual clutter that draws my attention away from the actual site content. \n\nWith the second example, it’s far easier to look beyond the tags, where I see:\n\nFirst the name of a company at the top of the page. That’s obviously going to be a header. \n\nIt’s followed by an anchor tag for the word home, which is obviously going to be the start of a nav bar. \n\nThat continues through the anchor tag for the word “Contact”, which is often the last section of a nav bar. \n\nThat’s followed by the text “Recent Articles”, which will obviously be followed by recent articles. \n\nSure enough, it’s followed by a bulleted list of 3 links, which are probably the recent articles. \n\nThat’s followed by the word “Blog”, which I assume is about to follow the same format I just saw. \n\nSure enough, there’s one word, which presumably a title, followed by a snippet. \n\nThen another. \n\nThat’s followed by the copyright notice, which means I’ve reached the footer. \n\nWhile, in the first example, the sheer volume of different tags (which, again, provide helpful context to bots, which I’m not) makes it hard to drill in and focus on the actual elements, which makes it harder for me to parse them and visualize them. \n\nThere’s just so many more words, making it harder to tell at a glance what’s a tag & what’s content. \n\nWhile, as I’ve said multiple times, the uniformity of “div, div, div” makes it considerably easier for my human eyes and brain to just gloss over them and parse/visualize the actual content section by section.",

I can't reply to everyone but appreciate the sense I get that I'm not alone. For now I'm choosing to appreciate that we were part of a fun time, and that it's still laid a path for today, both for me and others.

And when I turned early 30s, just after Covid, I wanted to start my own studio. Which I did, on the side with a full time job.\n\nLast year, I decided to go into trying to do this full time instead of with the job. First day being self employed, I had same thoughts. I wish I had taken advantage of low competition back then, with seo, and so on.\n\nBut then I reminded myself, skill and knowledge, if mixed with some creative thinking, is far more meaningful . It’s not stock market that I have to rely on time in the market. I reminded myself, I have a solid background and knowledge from working in many agencies, many clients and so on. Everything I did for agencies, bosses, clients, I should once try to implement this on my own business.\n\nJanuary this year, I rebuilt my site which by that time had little to no traffic for the last 1.5 year that domain had been registered. Zero enquiries in 1.5 years. \nThe new rebuilt was my goal saying: I’ll implement my 15sh years of design knowledge of high conversion pages, seo knowledge, content writing and structure knowledge, and rebuilt the site on modern framework so than one day when I start getting traffic i am ready. \n\nI browsed 50-100 popular agency sites which are all pre established for at least 5-10 years each. I was a new 36 year old kid in their block with a domain with zero back links. \n\nBut I had a strategy in mind. A small one. \n\nNow in July, (7months) I am on first page in 3 major  for a a popular web design agency keyword . 15 years ago I worked at an agency that was on first page for years, and today in 6 months my site is just two links under them. \n\nI also optimized my business site to be appearing in LLMs. \n\nIt took 6 months overall and 3 weeks of site built . And I am getting enquiries . (Previously all projects were from word of mouth) I ask these guys, how did you find me, they say Google, chatgpt, Google, Google, Claude, etc.\n\nAnd in my head, I smile. Because something I did right using some learning and got my business up there in 6 months.\n\nPoint is. You have 20 years of knowledge behind you. That knowledge is gold. Mix that gold with some creativity, some hacks, ingenuity , wisdom, experience. And you’ll still beat many players in the game. They have manpower, money, but you have experience, which is worth way more. \n\nI also cracked 3 clients from another agency who’s number one for a keyword on Google in 3 cities. 3 unhappy clients from them, found me on Google and signed up with me. \n\nSo again, you’re not old, you have not missed your chance, you might be a slow burn, long term, experienced player. Endurance horse race is a sport, where it’s not about how fast a horse runs but about how long it can go, and usually it’s not the fastest but horse with endurance wins. You don’t have to have shiny office, or proven case studies, but if you have knowledge of 2 decades, used wisely you can beat 80% of the so called competitors. \n\nThanks for reading my short essay",

It's not as gripping as \"Gone with the Wind\", but each trip down the rabbit hole brings up something you may never have considered: New ways to handle specific object types; Clearly bad examples for how to do things; exposure to functions and operators you might not normally use; etc. \n\nMost companies keep their code private so you only see it if you work for them. An open source project library like Github is an incredible learning opportunity, because you can see how various projects are organized, and how specific functions are implemented. As you go, you may find you have a solution for a problem, or a better way to implement a function: try it out, and if it works you can propose your patch.

I still work in it today, so I try to reframe my nostalgia—not as some old guy shaking his fist at clouds, but more as someone who lived through a rare, creative golden age.\n\nWhen I entered the field, the web felt like uncharted territory. It was exciting, full of discovery and freedom. You could crack open Notepad, write a few lines of HTML, and suddenly have something on the internet. Learning tables, slicing up images, adding animated GIFs. Back buttons, next buttons—all jumping around the screen like excited kids.\n\nAnd then came Flash. Sound, motion, interaction. Sure, it got abused, but it also gave us unforgettable digital environments—studios like 2Advanced or eye4u made things that felt like stepping into another world. It was more than a job. It was play.\n\nThe web was an incredible place 20-30 years ago. Now? Accessibility (while crucial) has limited creative expression. Phones shrunk the canvas. Engagement metrics replaced curiosity. Scroll culture replaced exploration. We’re buried in frameworks, version control, environments, package managers, and libraries on top of libraries. There’s less wonder, more boilerplate. More stack overflow, less spark.\n\nThe web grew up—and so did we.\n\nStill, I’m grateful I came up during that era—when both the web and I were still figuring things out.\n\nAs for “could’ve done more”—yeah, I feel that too. I’ve got friends who’ve been on TED stages and others earning insane salaries. Me? I struck a work/life balance. Made good money. Saved even more. But now, with kids who are 18 and 16, I sometimes feel a little hollow. Like I poured more into my family than into my own ambition.\n\nI don’t ache for the past out of longing—I ache because I lived it. I experienced what the web was—raw, creative, full of wonder. I got to build in that space when it was still a frontier. That’s why it stings a little. Because I know exactly what we’ve lost.\n\nNo regrets (maybe a little?)—just reflection.

The LLM tells them anything they would have found on a site, so the site isn't necessary anymore. You can still set up a personal web site or a business site, and I'm sure they'll still be a lot of those, but they'll be quaint afterthoughts.\n\nAs for social, I'm hoping the fediverse sorts itself out and becomes a thing since it would be decentralized, but I don't know if that will happen or catch on.\n\nOtherwise, I think the Internet is going to be a lot of apps and LLMs for the most part.

But you can also use `div`s; there's nothing wrong with using them.\n\nFor example, my website's navigation `ul` is wrapped in a `div`. This gives me a clickable mask layer on mobile when the menu is expanded. This lets you close the menu by clicking the mask layer (i.e., clicking off to the side). This is a common strategy with modal windows, too, where you can click the mask layer to close the modal window.\n\nI hope that helps!",

Our ADA consultant (who is overseas) said this banner isn't compliant. But I cannot find anything that says that alt tagging isn't an acceptable alternative when live text isn't available for whatever reason. \n\nWhat am I missing? Or are these folks just being ultra-conservative? I just want to understand. \n\nThank you.",

I’ve been working in digital design for 20 years and have never had a banner kicked back for ADA compliance that was properly alt-tagged. But then this industry is always changing, so I want to understand why this is. \n\nThe workaround they gave was to serve a black and white version of the image and use live text in the background of the div. (?) How is this an improvement over alt text? Seems odd. That’s why I feel like I’m missing something.",
