User can't change id lookup, and can't see \"real\" data behind the ID.\n\nUsing a cookie for authorization might work, but the value has to be signed and verified later. That's basically what a JWT is, a signed JSON string. Still, trusting the client to do anything but the most trivial checks is not secure.\n\nLike, hiding a menu option on the front end that links to a secured route if your JWT user claim doesn't include a specific role, probably fine... But you should still have the server verify creds if user accesses the route.\n\nYou can do all of this with cookies & JWT... Just be aware you need to verify everything the client gives you.

You don't get the loyalty program, but you still get the core service.\n\nA/B testing is admittedly trickier. You will be processing data which one *can* argue is personal, and for a purpose not essential to the core service you're providing. I was too quick to jump to it not being personal data, when the truth is it's ambiguous enough that you cannot be certain it's safe from regulatory action. There's no precedent to tell us whether it is or not, yet.\n\nIt all depends on the scope of your A/B testing.\n\nIf your A/B testing is as simple as \"how many sales do we have on version 1, 2, and 3 respectively?\" then it is not processing personal data at all. There is literally no identifiable information of any kind being stored or processed.\n\nThe second it turns identifiable, then you're in opt-in territory.   \nFact of the matter is though a lot of A/B testing can be done entirely anonymously. A/B systems just aren't typically designed for being anonymous because the business doesn't give a shit.\n\nRegistering mouse coordinate data for instance, isn't inherently under the purview of the GDPR, it's only when you tie it to an identifier like a cookie or user ID that it is. Pretty much all A/B testing systems do that though, so it becomes a GDPR matter. \n\nSo the real question is, what kind of A/B testing is being done, what kind of data is being stored, and can it all be entirely anonymous... If it can be, then you're golden.\n\nPs. I feel like enticing opt-in is a fantastic way to get regulatory bodies on your ass. I wouldn't touch that with a ten-foot pole. \n\nPPs. We all need to ask ourselves as the ones creating these services if we're actually fighting tooth and nail for something that's actually beneficial, or if we're just used to a certain way of doing things and have an idea what we're doing is \"good for business\".",

The A/B testing we conduct is entirely centered on page layout, and no personal data is collected - we can't even drill down into individual session data.\n\nHowever, [the ICO only gives three examples of cookies exempt from opt-in](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/#exemptions):\n\n>...you are unlikely to need consent for:  \n>  \n>‚Ä¢ cookies used to remember the goods a user wishes to buy when they add goods to their online basket or proceed to the checkout on an internet shopping website;  \n>  \n>‚Ä¢ session cookies providing security that is essential to comply with data protection security requirements for an online service the user has requested ‚Äì eg online banking services; or  \n>  \n>‚Ä¢ load-balancing cookies that ensure the content of your page loads quickly and effectively by distributing the workload across several computers.\n\nThe new Head of IT is incredibly risk-averse, and so interprets this as meaning that all A/B testing requires consent. \n\nThe only writing I can find about whether or not A/B testing is allowed without consent or as opt-out post-2018 comes from either cookie solution software providers (which have a strong incentive to say that we need to pay for their software in order to A/B test) and [this page,](https://www.convert.com/blog/privacy/analytics-and-a-b-testing-cookies-only-after-consent-in-europe/) which can only provide a solid statement on the issue from the French authorities. I need something to present to him as a credible source that makes the case that our A/B testing can continue without opt-in consent.",

I don't even read them anymore I just instantly close them, I don't care if it tells me I have won $10,000 I don't give a f\\*ck just f\\*ck off. Most of the time it is something one off I have google and opened several tabs for an answer, I will probably never visit your site again. Infact I now isntantly close all that have a stupid f'n popup. AGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!",

The site will host encouraging scriptures and advice, but will ask nothing of  visitors in any way. In fact, it will offer viewers no possible way to enter data or even contact anyone. It will be stand-alone for information only.  Other than a bare-bones visitor count, I will not design the site to intentionally harvest any other information from visitors.\n\nWhat I want to know is, is the site is not harvesting data, and ask for no data or provides anyone for the users to even input any data, does the privacy laws still require have things like a Cookie Consent and a Privacy Disclaimer?\n\nI obviously want to obey the law, I just think that having disclaimer popups about Cookies and Tracking will be give the wrong impression about the site's purpose. I mean, the purpose is to offer no-strings, hands-off, anonymous, encouragement and hope to people. Having a popup saying \"**We might be tracking you!\"** seems to counter the message the site is intended to send and is misleading, since that is not what I will design the site to do.  I understand that there may be some tracking done by the hosting company and by google, but that is not something the site will be doing or have any control over. \n\nCan it be done?",

You could also consider offering a discreet cookie notice, maybe without a pop-up, as an alternative, ensuring the user experience aligns with your site's message of privacy and simplicity.\n\nWhile it's understandable to not want pop-ups, the key is transparency.

But the data you collect cannot identify a specific person without extreme dedication.\n\nSo town/state/country are a definite no. You could pretty easily identify a user from their town, depending on the content of the site (i.e. if it's niche, there's less people in town who'd be your \"target\").

Finding 1 person in a group of 33,000 isn't \"impossible\".\n\nUser IDs/email address/etc. are obvious nos. But a session ID *could* be ok if the ID is completely random and there is no storage of it anywhere; i.e. you were using it to be able to track user journeys...

So again, probably safer to leave it out.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think there's a hard and fast rule on what is \"personally identifiable\", outside of the obvious things (user ID, email address, phone number, name, etc.) so I would generally just say that if could I look at the analytics and say which data is **likely** mine (it may not be, but based on the data it could be), then it is personally identifiable.

The actual European legal text is:\n\n> the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information\n\nSo it is the *storing and accessing* of information that triggers consent requirements, not the use of cookies in particular. Other rules around the globe, such as those in California, employ similarly broad language.\n\n(A minor side note, but cookie law is called EPD, not GDPR as many seem to believe. Gdpr is a separate somewhat related regulation that came later).\n\nThe more nuanced answer is that it depends what the pixel actually does. If it merely counts page views numerically, my understanding is that does not trigger any consent requirements. It is technically possible to create analytics that sufficiently avoid collecting user information as to not require consent, but almost no one does this, so in practice effectively all tracking pixels trigger consent requirements.\n\nFurther reading: https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2023/11/20/edpb-publishes-guidelines-to-clarify-scope-of-eu-cookie-notice-and-consent-requirements/",

I literally just made a text field and put on a label that says \"Do not put anything in this field. It is for bot detection. If this field contains a value, the form data is discarded\". I then hide the input field with CSS (display:none). \nIf this is set, I will also just show success and not store the data.\n\nWhile this likely cuts down on some of the spam, it is not nearly enough.\nNow that I think of it, I do not count how many requests I discard based on this honeyput - I probably should gather stats on that..\n\n\nYour cookie idea is interesting!\n\nWould you mind elaborating a bit on how you actually do this?\n\n1: Do you set the cookie on the page that contains the form?\n\n2: Cookie set server-side or with javascript?\n (my sites are completely static, so I cannot set server side cookies easily, however, I might be able to put something in apache that sets a cookie on a specific path)\n\n3: So do you just measure the timestamp on the server with what is in the cookie. And if it is, say, less than a second, you discard the request?\n\n4: What is a reasonable time difference needed for you not to discard?\n\n\n\nI have actually played a bit with a similar idea. What I do is I put a form element \n\n    <input type=\"hidden\" id=\"timestamp\" name=\"timestamp\">\n\nI then have some javascript set the timestamp value to current time.\n\nI then check on the server side on the server that processes the requests what the time difference is between the timestamps. My idea was that if the time difference was less than 1-2 seconds, then a human could not have filled the form. And if the time difference was too great (more than 24h) then it would probably be some bot that just uses  are stored set of values. Also, if the value was not set I would discard it.\n\nI have not ended up using this, however, because I lost actual real requests from at least one customer who uses NoScript extension.\nAnd also, I use a different server to process requests than the one serving the static sites. So even though I use NTP to sync time, there would sometimes be drift that caused those servers not to have sufficiently sync'ed up clocks to be reliable...",

First, good on you for having the sense to ask before doing.\n\nYou do not want to track any user behavior without tracking / cookie consent, otherwise you will be liable in countries protected by gdpr law. The only way to get around this is to not provide service in EU countries.\n\nJust add a standard TOS contract & a tracking consent banner. They're everywhere nowadays.\n\nAlso, be wary of forwarding personally identifiable info to any analytics vendors you use (such as amplitude). Everything needs to be anonymized. If you use email as a unique users identifier, then you'll want to encrypt before sending. Many dev sdks for sending data do not do this for you, and may also auto-collect other info such as IP. Even browser settings can fall under this category (ex, browser / device fingerprinting).\n\nBy venturing into behavioral tracking territory, you are now considered a \"data controller\" under gdpr. If you do not anonymize data sent to 3rd parties, then you need to provide mechanisms allowing your users to perma-delete their data from said 3rd parties.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: By the way, my recommendation if you think you will lean into behavioral tracking, is to send data through segment.io.

The localStorage is a boolean stored on the USER side. No user data is stored or acquired on the server to achieve the unique count that wouldn't already be present with any other HTTP request. If you visit a site from Google search results, the HTTP request for your first page view before agreeing to any policy is exactly the same as the ajax HTTP request that would be ran under the hood for incrementing the unique tally. It's perfectly legal to count page views and unique visits without user consent if you're utilizing either of the two methods (localStorage or 304 Not Modified) described in my previous post. As mentioned earlier, any argument otherwise is the equivalent to saying a restaurant owner can't count the number of people who walk into their restaurant every day without the express consent of each customer.\n\nOnce you start using persistent session IDs and/or logging IP addresses to count unique page views, then there's an argument to be had. But the two methods I've described are not in a gray area and do not require user consent since neither method gives you ANY means to actually track or identify the user in subsequent HTTP requests - there's no ID or hash to identify them in any way (even anonymously). There's no data link of any kind. No names, no IP addresses, no hashes, no codes - zip zero nada.\n\nFrankly the fact this is even an issue shows how absurd the laws are and how absurd people's interpretations of said laws are.  Look at your web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS - whatever) - even if you're not counting anything on your website or using any cookies of any kind, chances are your server is logging all kinds of crap (IP addresses, user agents, referrers, etc.) behind the scenes and chances are your firewall is logging all kinds of crap behind the scenes. I bet 2/3 of the people here saying you need user consent to count unique views have all of the aforementioned logs running behind the scenes on the server or firewall level without nary a thought about disabling them. Furthermore, people running smaller web applications via shared hosting providers wouldn't even have the means to disable such logs.

It's about requiring user consent regarding the collection of user data (including anonymous data) that is not \"strictly necessary.\" So you're absolutely right about the scope of it.

I've read through numerous FAQs and EU documents on the topic and have found absolutely nothing that distinguishes the method I've just described from any other regular page view that would exist and be recorded prior to someone accepting or rejecting a cookie or privacy policy. The method I've described equates to a page view - nothing more. It involves nothing more than an HTTP request. It requires no identifying HTTP headers, nor does it anonymize data (meaning it does NOT take identifiable data and convert it to anonymous data). It's literally just a page view. All that is different is it is only viewed once. You aren't storing ANY user data whatsoever. You're incrementing a single number. It's perfectly legal to count page views and measure server load. How is this any different? That's like saying a restaurant owner isn't allowed to count the number of people walking through their door every day without the express consent of each patron.\n\nAnother way to count unique views without a notice is via asset caching. For example, if you send a cache header for a regular asset (like a CSS stylesheet that is present on every page) that expires in X days, there's nothing stopping you from incrementing your unique views everytime you send an HTTP response for that asset that doesn't include a \"304 Not Modified\" header.",

This does not need to be front and center on your site, but if you‚Äôre going to track your users you are legally required (in some jurisdictions like California and Europe) to tell them and give them an opt out mechanism. Rather than have different messages for different regions, it‚Äôs better to just have it somewhere on the site, which is why so many implement it as a modal.\n\nThats why you see so many sites with that the ‚Äúthis site uses cookies‚Äù modal, and which has a ‚Äúmore info‚Äù link that shows the privacy policy (which no one will ever read).\n\nI like mixpanel because its sdk makes it easy to update the users preference and tie it to a button/click.

This  year we're expecting around 250 cars and maybe 2000 people. Every car is given a number, and historically we've hand counted paper ballots, but the last couple years have seen the numbers of cars and voters skyrocket. Hand counting last year was brutal. \n\nOn my site I have a page with all the categories listed, the user clicks on whatever category they want, and places their vote on whatever software is embedded in the page. I'd really like to avoid making people sign in to anything.   \n  \nI was planning on using CrowdSignal, but in testing I found one of my friends is able to vote as many times as they'd like, even though the check box is ticked for once per computer. It locks out everyone else but her. For whatever reason her Iphone with safari sneaks past their cookie based system.\n\nI'm worried about hitting the limit for a free account on Survey Monkey, and I don't want to pay for a full year for a single event.\n\nSogolytics  looks great but they don't allow surveys to be one response only.  With a poll you can only do multiple choice, and it only allows 150 choice inputs. \n\nGoogle Forms requires a google log in to limit to one response. But I do really like that you can go back in and change your response. \n\nAnyone got any other suggestions to look at? \n\nThanks in advance. ",

If the image is not a perfect square in your case then the longer side of the rectangle will have to expand beyond 100% to compensate. \n\nAssuming you want this effect of the image filling up the entire 200x200px area it would be best to crop your images square before uploading. Otherwise if it's a rectangle then one side will always need to expand beyond 100% width of the container and the image will be cut off like you're seeing. \n\nI can't tell you why it looks fine in the editor without seeing the code, but my guess is something outside of the editor is constraining the images to 200px (other plugin, external css, js, etc) and the editor doesn't have that same constraint, eyeballing it the images in your editor look wider than the live site.",

Then ai would probably be referenced other ai sites until weird things start to happen or the code slowly becomes outdated and useless. There always needs to be someone to make something look and feel better and someone to fix and optimise that.",

It's a very simple site, and I'm wicked smart, so I'm going to figure it out. A little bit of advice from some more experienced programmers will help a lot.\n\nThe modern standard is to use drag and drop templates to build simple websites. These templates do a lot of the responsiveness work for you. But the downside is that there is no attention to detail. So everything looks OK, but nothing looks really good. I'm building a sleek, tight website with all of the layout details thought through on every commonly used device at every commonly used setting. It's going to blow my competitors out of the water.\n\nIt is a very simple site. It's almost completely static. The only nearly dynamic parts are drop down product descriptions and a contact form that sends me an email. No cookies, no logins, no cart, no checkout. It's an old school landing page with a navigation bar in the header and several pages for products, services, and information.\n\nI started off in WordPress, but I've been making much faster progress since I abandoned it and started using html, CSS and JavaScript with no template.\n\nI've got the site layout built and all of the content loaded. I've got it formatted so it looks good on my desktop. The next step is to make it look good on all commonly used devices at all commonly used settings. For that I'm going to use emulators to show me how the website renders on various devices at various settings.\n\nWhat I want to know is, which emulator(s) should I use? Which specific categories of devices and settings do I need to worry about? What are the clever little tricks that are going to save me hours of tedium and squinting?\n\nI am using Windows 10 on a PC.",

The Variables get changed by a Media Query with prefers-color-scheme. If the user selects a certain Theme / toggles it, then you save that in the Cookie and read it on side load. When the Cookie is e.g. \"Dark\" then you add the class  \"dark\" to your body and use that to style your site. Because multiple classes are more dominant than a media queries you probably don't even need to do an extra parameter for your media query that toggles it off.\n\nStoring the Data of the prefered Theme in a Cookie is a good idea. You   \nDONT need seperate CSS files depending on the Theme (unless you want to   \nchange more than the main colors). Hope that helps!",

I found the product through a google search and see it's probably what I've been looking for. But then I get an annoying popup in the middle of the screen suggesting I go to the localised version of this site instead of the international version. If I click yes to get what you would (presume) is better more localised information, you would think it would take me to the localised version of that product page. But no, most of the time it will take me to the homepage of the localised version instead of that thing I want's page. \n\nWho the fuck actually designs such a thing and goes \"ah yes, this is better!\". I cannot grasp why anyone would think this is a good idea. And to top it off, websites sometimes take your \"yes\" as a licence to redirect you to the localised version in future making it hard to go back to where you were. Now I have to delete cookies.\n\nSimilarly is the tendency now to redirect people to the home page if anything goes wrong on an online shop. Big local Australian hardware chain comes to mind. I try to go to the product page of something I needed and found a few days ago, but now it redirects me to the homepage. No explanation, it just does it.

        "selftext": " Hi Everyone,\n\nI would like to create a small side business offering financial planning and consulting services. I am looking to gather some information and possibly quotes for someone to develop a website and a logo for me. I do not have a coding/website development background and don't describe myself as creative/artistic so hence why I want to dip my toes in the water to get a rough idea on what this might cost me. Here is what I am looking for:\n\n1. Someone to give advice on domain acquisition and hosting. I have a domain name in mind and it is available.\n2. Someone to create a unique website from scratch. This website will not sell products, it will merely provide an overview of myself, the company, the services we offer, a contact page, etc. I would also like the ability to get to a log in page with some password protected pages for myself or clients. I would also like to use a private part of the site for non-business matters like storing personal pictures or other files. I am envisioning maybe 5 main public pages on the website. I do not have the text written up yet for the pages and I would like the ability to change the text years down the road on my own.\n3. Someone to create a logo that I own the explicate rights to that can be used on the website, business cards, etc.\n4. Someone who can educate me, quantify improvements, and implement actions for Search Engine Optimization.\n\nWith that in mind what questions should I be asking to ensure I am getting apples to apples quotes from people who can provide these services? I know that there are some basic website development tool palates and I am inclined to think that might result in a cookie cutter looking website which I want to avoid. Is this gut feeling valid or not?\n\nThanks!",

But it doesn't really matter. If you intend to bring in help, at the end of the day you're making a web app and you just need to bring your expectations. If you intend to do it or learn about the process, you'll find that any app involving accessing lists of entries shares a lot of underlying logic. So making a to do list like most tutorials show, while different, gives you all the same tools. \n\nMore specific advice might be helped by knowing what you're research is meant to accomplish.",

Databases - you can run one on your computer, add data to it with SQL, define the schema of the data. Query it with command line commands, get lists of data back from it. Think of it like a command line program on your computer. There's no user interface other than the command line, it's just on your computer. \n\nA web app, it's a running application that can take people's web requests and serve them responses that they can see in their browser or other web-requesting thing, over a private network or the internet, if they're connected.\n\nNow, most web apps need data, so there are ways of making your web app go and look up data in a database when it needs it, but the problem you have is you've merged the two concepts and now want a \"database web application\" that you can install. That's not how it works.\n\nIf we were to build it we would take a web framework for the web part and connect it to a database. They would be two different, separate things. Just because others have done it and it seems like it's an all-in-one deal, it's not. It takes coders and code to make them seem like that.",

It doesn't sound like a particularly big project by any means, the majority of the work would be the database interaction. \n\nThere's nothing I can really recommend to research unless you're going to delve into developing this yourself.

However, with more knowledge I could also be better able to direct another if I commission this as a paid for project. I have absolutely no requirement for the site to look good. It simple has to fill the following functions.\n\n* Have a page listings all parts in the database as text (with images provided on hovering the part names) with a text box next to each.\n* Users would put in the number of pieces they have from 0 to 9,999.  \n\n* At the top and bottom of the page would be a save button, that would output to a downloadable text file. Allowing people to save their entrys as text. If its possible to save to cookies that would work too. \n\n[The data output would not include entries for items in which the user stated quantity of 0. There will be an advanced code option to enter and * which will be taken to mean the user does not have the part but wants to system to perform all searches as though the user has 9,999 and any sets listed as a result of the * entry will be highlighted: if all entries are * then the output should be every set highlighted].\n\n* On the 'next' page would be a space to upload the contents of the text file by cut and paste. And a series of questions via tickboxes.\n\n[It should be possible to return to the parts list page after entering the txt file data should one need to make changes].\n* Once the questions are answered the database would output a series of lists.\n\n* The key feature is that the database would be able to output:\n\n1. Sets you can make with your collection.\n2. Sets you can make if you use parts from your collection which do not match the colours in the instructions.\n3. Sets you could make from commercially available parts which were/are not common in retail sets. - The parts in this list will be subjective and set by the admin - by tagging in the database so as to make it easier to update the list.\n\n4. Output would be saved if the user leaves the page and then returns with back or other means.\n\n5. The ability to **invert** the output so it shows only the sets it would usually hide - in each category.\n\n* The database for sets will be searchable by the set codes but the pages for each set would only contain the parts lists for the set and cover art. A PDF of instructions will only be provided for instructions not digitised by the manufacture.\n\n\nAh, a final requirement. There are over 2,000 sets and over 200 parts and over 100 colours. The final output would need to be able to distinguish parts [by shape] from [parts by] colours if asked to. I imagine the best way to do this would be a unique database-only name (or representative hex number) for each part which includes the colour and shape. But I imagine it could be also done by the equivalent of tagging multiple tags to each entry (such as part 1, shape 1, colour 1,).",

        "selftext": "A year ago I went to the Chinese version of the minecraft.net homepage (minecraft.net/zh-hans) in Chrome and now, if I clear site cookies & data via the inspector and type in minecraft.net or go there via Google, I get the Chinese version! I live in the U.S. and, well, everything else either has a \"pick your country\" landing page or just serves me the `en-us` version.\n\nEarlier this year I was seriously out of the loop on what \"onlyfans\" was, so I googled it, and got the impression that it was a china-only thing because it defaulted to Chinese. I now know that's not the case, and lo-and-behold if I delete cookies for that site, it also defaults to Chinese.\n\nI repeated this test in Firefox. Initially, minecraft.net loads the `en-us ` version. If I change the language to `zh-hans` it will persist, even if I clear cookies.\n\nHow is this information being stored? Is there a third-party involved that both of these sites query, or a unique browser ID or something? Is it possible to convince both these sites that I'm not Chinese?\n\n**Solved! When I first visited the minecraft site in Chinese, I used Chrome's built-in translation feature, and somehow Chinese got added to Chrome's language settings, resulting in Chinese being added to my `HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` http header field.**",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôve decided to design a few sites these next coming months and I‚Äôm looking for advice on which platforms would be best to use in 2020. \n\nI graduated college in 2016 with experience in coding using Adobe Dreamweaver. I managed to code my own website from top to bottom including some bootstrap modifications, used a CSS (which I‚Äôm now learning about scss/sass), used codepen for things like my responsive navigation menu, and illustrator to create images for my portfolio. HOWEVER I am learning that with today‚Äôs technology I really should start learning how to use platforms such as WordPress seeing that businesses require you to know how to use it AND it makes coding so much quicker. \n\nSo over this last week, I started building a site in WP and found that you actually need to use their templates for the wireframe (which is 100% editable). However, I learned you need add-on‚Äôs to actually edit the content effectively. I have the free version of Elementor but in order to do anything substantial (including editing the appearance of my nav-bar) I need to buy the pro version. FYI I am already paying for the entire Adobe Creative Suite. Before I put money into Elementor, I want to know what are you all using in 2020 t build your sites? \n\nIdeally, this is what I‚Äôm looking for. \n‚Ä¢ I want to freelance beautiful sites with varying degrees of pages/elements. \n‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt want to stress too much about updating my content with today‚Äôs constantly updated browsers. \n‚Ä¢ I want to build sites at a decent manageable speed. \n‚Ä¢ I want my sites to provide my clients with an edge and not just look like every other cookie cutter site. \n‚Ä¢ I want my knowledge to transfer over to other jobs in the market (my husband is in the military which means we move a ton) and I‚Äôve considered landing a job with an agency. \n\nI am open to any knowledge and advice you may have.

You scroll vertically to see more content, links either open new pages / popups or scroll somewhere else, etc. Anything out of the ordinary needs to be extra thought out to feel natural and not confusing. One way to achieve that is by building on top of existing experiences the user might have.\n\nA fantastic example [is this site](https://bruno-simon.com/), where you drive an RC car around the pages \"landscape\". It works because almost everyone has played a game where you steer a car, so you already know the controls, and also it's just plain fun.\n\nVR, on the other hand, is tricky. You need to port the experience to a 2D screen in the end, which comes with all the problems VR is trying to solve - navigating, manipulating content etc.\n\nSo if I were you, I would pick from these options -\n\n* The \"toy car game\" approach, where it's a fun, familiar experience\n* Keep using \"normal\" interfaces, but use 3D for backgrounds and flourishes that responds to scroll / mouse movements, like [here for example](https://go.pioneer.com/cornrevolution) or [here](https://www.orano.group/experience/innovation/en/protect).\n\nOf course, it depends on what the website is actually about. If it's for yourself personally to experiment with, it would probably be fun to try to do something unorthodox with [threejs](https://threejs.org/) or push 3D CSS to its limits.",
