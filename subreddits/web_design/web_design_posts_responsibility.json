        "selftext": "Just wanna share a new website starter kit I made for everyone to use for their own projects. I built this with u/fugi_tive who helped me with all the SSG and CMS work. This is for all you designers who can code. \n\nHere‚Äôs the repo:\n\nhttps://github.com/Oak-Harbor-Kits/Starter-Kit-V4-Eleventy\n\nHere‚Äôs a live demo of what the site looks like out the box\n\nhttps://starterkit-v4-eleventy.netlify.app/\n\nIt comes with 5 hand coded mobile first pages in only html and css, responsive navigation that‚Äôs easy to customize, working dark mode, and working blog and contact form. \n\nIt‚Äôs built with Eleventy static site generator and has a functional blog that has all the configurations setup to connect to the Netlify cms with like 4 clicks and you can invite your client to the site to login on their domain and create their own blog posts. No Wordpress. No databases. All done with a static site generator that we configured ourselves so it all just works. You don‚Äôt have to configure anything. We already did it. Just follow the steps and it should all just work!\n\nIn the readme file there‚Äôs a video on how to convert an already built site into the new kit to utilize components for the header and footer to repeat in all pages from One file source. Just a bunch of copy and pasting and filling in some variables really. Also shows you how to move over an existing blog into the new system and connect to netlfiy and everything. \n\nWe lay every thing out for you and did all the heavy lifting. I‚Äôll be using this for all my clients moving forward now and I wanted to share it and make it free open license to use for any of your projects that need blogs or want to use a static site generator but they were too hard to learn and configure. \n\nIf you are making a new website, just delete the pages in the kit and replace them with new ones and new css files (except the blog page, keep that!). Everything else is handled for you. Just follow the steps on how to use the kit and create your files. \n\nIf you don‚Äôt need the blog, just remove the blog folder and page. Put them back in if you ever need to add it in the future and it will still work. \n\nHope everyone likes this and it‚Äôs helpful. I spent a lot of time writing the readme file to make it easy to understand what to do even for people Who have never used a static site generator before. Which prior to a week ago was me too. So I wrote everything i wish I had explained to me if I didn‚Äôt have someone holding my hand the whole way. \n\nSo clone it and use however you want! Let me know what you think.",

Glad to see you're expanding your skill set and utilizing 11ty!\n\nHave you considered using [11ty navigation plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/) for handling navigation? As of right now, you're hard coding all the routes in header.html and repeating yourself in stuff like checking if the page is active or not. For smaller sites it might be fine, but we should avoid repeating ourselves if we can. \n\nThis plugin will allow you to add some metadata to your pages, like this:\n\n    ---\n    eleventyNavigation:\n      key: Home\n    ---\n\nwhere key is the name of your page. Optionally, you can add 'order' parameter to your eleventyNavigation to order your links however you want.\n\nThen, at the top of your header.html you set a variable like this:\n\n     {% set navPages = collections.all | eleventyNavigation %}\n\nthis will give you an array of navigation objects that you can loop through and render links. If you want to check how each navigation object looks like, you can dump them like this:\n\n    {{ navPages | dump | safe }}",

But not every variable will be a straight swap. Some borders and some backgrounds will have different colors or certain sections might need a different dark mode color than the basic variable swap. What if one border in a section has a different style and color than another and their dark modes need to have different colors? Should I make a dozen variables for every color used no matter how little it‚Äôs used? I feel like I have more control and room for customization when I have section specific dark mode styles. Maybe simpler sites can benefit from your method. But more intricate designs tend to need more custom tweaks to make dark mode feel even more immersive and aesthetically pleasing. My dark.css sheet covers the toggle and base styles for dark mode and the sections have their own specific dark mode styles based on their design. I prefer to spend a little extra time and have a much more unique and fleshed out dark mode. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",

Since my current workflow was pretty quick and easy, I never needed to learn SSG‚Äôs and I just left them alone since I didn‚Äôt have the time to figure it out on my own.

The site is built before the user clicks on the link, so web crawlers are free to explore and rank the website accordingly.\n\neCommerce - Never made an eCommerce site before, but I can't see why this kit wouldn't be good for it. If you can built an eCommerce site with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, you'll have no issues here. It may even be easier, seeing as you can create templates for any page/component you'd need.\n\n3rd Party Apps - Supported\n\nScalability - SSG and scalability is like bread to butter. The apple to the pie. The beans to the toast. If you look through Citrous' other starter kits, you'll notice that the header and footer are separate on each page, meaning to update them all, you'll have to go through, one by one, to make the change in all places. With this kit we've built now, there's one single source of truth for the header, footer, and other reusable assets. It can't get much more scalable than that.\n\nI'm not sure how much you know about SSGs and templating languages, but I encourage - nay, urge - you to have a look into them. Maybe even start using the kit yourself. I describe it as having the best parts of a framework-driven application and a vanilla, static site. Some good words to read up on are \"static site generators\", \"JAMstack\" and \"headless content management system\" - this kit involves all three of those things",

If styles differ too, pair this with SASS mixins for extremely flexible components\n* Centralise key bits of data in a \\_data folder (phone numbers, addresses, emails etc. Could do an entire restuarant menu in a data file)\n* Automatically optimise, resize and convert images with the [eleventy image](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) plugin. All greens on Lighthouse on-demand, if you're smart with the rest of your code\n* Connect to a CMS to allow them pesky clients to do some of the website updates for you\n\nIt's because of these reasons I call 11ty+SASS a pseudo-framework for websites.

If you have basic understanding of HTML, CSS and know what JavaScript is I imagine you have an idea of how these peaces fit together. Is there something more specific you are questioning?  \n\n\nIf not try taking a step back from code and learn how a website is served. When you go to a website things happen. There is a server on that you might have a server scripting language and a database. When the website loads its in the client (browser). In this you have HTML, CSS and JS. Each one of these things do different things. The only one you really need is HTML. As you see working with CSS each one of these skills you add greatly increases what you can do. Learn what the different parts do. I am not saying go learn all of these right now but understand what they do to have a better understanding of how it comes together.  \n\n\nHappy coding!",

As new techniques and browser support developed, we used more JS to improve the user experience.  Early JS support was flaky across different browsers, and back when jQuery was the only 'framework' available, you didnt want to have mission critical functions breaking because of some quirky browser or proxy server behavior.  It's only fairly recently that most proxy servers have support PUT/DELETE/PATCH requests.  This is not a light weight system.  It's used by some fairly large corporate clients for serious line of business stuff.  \n\nDon't quote me on the exact timing - this thing was originally built some 25 years ago, but has been maintained and updated and is still essentially the same core system, just with a few JS bells and whistles thrown in.  The core functionality of the system is still mainly form POST based.  We use some JS to do some fancy visual menus etc and a little bit of FORM pre processing, but those functions degrade nicely without JS.  There are a few parts of the system that use AJAX, local storage, indexed db etc, but they are for specific parts of the application where we know client support for these techs will be available.  All of this works perfectly well on tablets and a wide range of desktop browsers.\n\nYou can achieve a hell of a lot with just HTML and CSS.  I'm the main JS guy on the project and love finding places to use cool new techs, but I totally get that it is really just the icing on the cake.",

I understand the principles of designing for smaller screens - make it readable, use breakpoints.\n\nBut what about when designing for bigger screens?  Should I make my elements and font size a fixed size, or should they all scale with the viewport width?  I made a quick example of both - one that is responsive ([Example A](https://codepen.io/seanmcnally/full/RNbZEER)) and one that is fixed ([Example B](https://codepen.io/seanmcnally/full/QwLMzYm)).\n\nWhile the font size of Example B looks suuuuuper tiny on large screens, should I assume that those with larger screen resolutions will also have monitors that are physically larger than my 25\" 1440p display, and therefore will be able to read that tiny font?  And should I assume they'll have some sort of DPI setting cranked up, making it bigger anyway?\n\nOr should I assume that tiny fonts will look tiny on bigger displays, and scale all of my elements proportionally with the width, as in Example A?  I understand responsive design is paramount when it comes to modern web design, so I'd love to learn what the best practice is here.  Thanks!\n\nedit: changed links to codepen",

The zoom level just sets the ratio of real pixels to CSS units.\n\nWhat most sites have is a max width that the main content will take up (around 1000-1200 in my experience).  So if the screen is wider than that, there will be empty space on the sides and the main content will be centered.  If there's left or right nav bars, they'll stay glued to the very far left.\n\nYou'll notice most screens are wider than the maximum too.  On a 1080p screen most sites will have gaps on the left and right of the main content.\n\nLast thing, this is mainly for information centric websites.

Maybe somebody can help?\n\nRedoing my wife's interior design site. It's really just functioning as a  'lookbook' for potential clients, like \"oh, yeah, go to mywifessite dot com\" and look at a bunch of pretty pictures. No case studies or sub pages. Just one big vertical scroller.\n\n[Here's a hasty preview.](https://ibb.co/jvb8W8yR) Laid out with InDesign because that's how I do her leave-behind books.\n\nSo on desktop it'd be three equal columns wide but needs to be responsive and fold down to one on say... portrait mobile.\n\nEvery image would just have a lightbox action on click / tap. A reliable 30px padding between each virtual \"cell\".\n\nThis is the sort of thing you could just use tables to do thirty years ago. Except for one thing.\n\nThe images have fixed width but not height. So whatever's happening in the left column in terms of line breaks can't affect the middle or right. (again, words fail me but an image comp doesn't)\n\nI've come at this a couple of different ways but I am admittedly a WYSIWYG type who doesn't understand the WordPress interface like... at all.... HTML/CSS I can wrap my head around (and will constantly be adding / moving content).\n\nBad as it was with generating bloated code, I used to LOVE Adobe Muse for things like this.

However, now I‚Äôm at the stage where I need to turn these low-fidelity wireframes into a fully responsive design, and I‚Äôm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nDo you usually build directly on top of wireframes, or do you completely rework them once you start adding visuals and interactions?

Maybe be explicit about when things should break to the next line.¬†\n\nOne time, our design partner offered to send over an html/css sample for the layout. I don‚Äôt think they ever did, but I loved the idea. CSS is the perfect language for devs and designers to communicate effectively in terms of how exactly a design should be rendered.¬†\n\nAnother thing that worked great was when they sent over what I call a style palette. Things like colors and typography settings.\n\nI love when designers can see the system patterns and simplify things before I get started. When I look at designs, I have to break them down into system components.¬†\n\nThe amount of variation can multiply the amount of effort to construct the system.¬†\n\nThe complexity of the system design can increase project costs by a linear, multiple, or exponential amount. Your decisions impact the total cost and potential value delivered by a project.\n\nIf you choose to increase complexity, you better have a solid explanation of the value gained, otherwise it‚Äôs an excess cost.¬†\n\nThe kicker is that some complex things are easy if there‚Äôs a known solution. If you design around what‚Äôs feasible, you can go all out. The only way to know for sure is to include the engineers and validate your designs along the way.¬†\n\nSo between figma vs prototyping, yes to both.

The best move is usually to treat those wireframes as a strong foundation and gradually layer on visuals and interactivity rather than scrapping them. Tools like Figma are great here ‚Äî you can take your wireframes and build responsive layouts directly by creating frames for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints. That helps you keep the structure while adapting for screen sizes. Once the design feels solid visually, you can move to code using a mobile-first approach with something like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness.

Is it actually efficient?\n\nOr if there are another good pattern for responsive design, i'm open to any recommendation, thanks!",

Font sizes as well. Paddings  etc. minimizes the number of media queries you have to write. \n\nUse flexbox for layouts. No need for the 12 column grid anymore. Just do flexbox. Set a flex direction column on mobile and change flex direction to row on tablet or desktop, whichever it needs to be. Use the gap property to set the gap between the elements. \n\nEvery section is wrapped in a section tag with 16px padding left and right and 60px-100px clamps top and bottom. This creates the optimal spacing between the top and bottoms and sides of the section. Then each section tag has a container class inside of it that‚Äôs set to width 100% and max width 1280px. This makes it responsive. Everything else set inside of it will have a width 100% and a max width to stop at. This is the core concept of mobile first responsive designs. No fixed width values. You use percentages and max widths so elements grow with the screen size and stop at their maximum width that‚Äôs in the design. By using this methodology and clamps, that‚Äôs like most of it. At most you need 1 Media query to reset the flexbox orientations and that‚Äôs it. All of the core styles and measurement values happen in the mobile first code, and as you go up in media queries you‚Äôre just changing arrangements of flexboxes. When you have to make edits, it‚Äôs all in the mobile code in one spot. Nice and easy. I like to put my mobile code in a 0rem media query so I can collapse it and add the other media queries for that section below it and collapse that too so my css is clean and organized and all the sections css is in one chunk. So much easier to edit code and work. \n\nThink of everything in terms of a flexbox and sometimes you have to use flexbox to set a base arrangement and then use margins on elements to push them away from the flexbox edges to match the design arrangements. Like if you have a container and the two elements inside it as spaced apart so they are in opposite ends of the container ( justify-content: space-between) but you notice the left element is actually 50px away from the left edge of the container in the figma design. Well you just use the space-between property to push them to the left and right sides of the container and add margin left of 50px to the left element to push it away from the container edge just like in the design. That‚Äôs how you use flexbox efficiently. Create your arrangement, and use margins and paddings to do fine tuning inside of them.",

You should make that as quick and easy as possible instead of making them explore.\n\nThe root issue with hamburger menus is that they hide links and functionality that tends to be most important and the icon does not at all imply to users what's hidden behind a click/tap of the button. I've seen sign in/out and account settings behind them, as well as site navigation.\n\nOnce you hide something behind a menu button you've made it far less obvious that something exists (users won't be looking for something they don't even know about) and you've also added an extra step in navigating.\n\nI prefer to keep such things limited as much as is practical so that I can have maybe four or five things visible at all times in a sticky nav bar.

All of the elements in the outline are things I've seen before, so I know they should be no problem, except one thing: An image that has clickable areas, and the clickable areas can be changed out. Specifically: a table on which there are various objects, such as a pair of glasses, a watch, a notebook, etc. Each of these objects is clickable and links to a product description page. \n\n\nSo the question is: can this be designed in a way that the clickable areas can be changed. The glasses can be removed, and a pair of shoes put there, or the notebook can be removed and a fountain pen put in that space. \n\n\nMy (very limited) understanding is that:\n- It's possible if an entirely new image is created with the same table image as the background, but replacing the changed objects using a photo editing tool. Then a new image map can be created by specifying the new objects' areas as clickable.\n\n\nIs that doable? or am I delusional?\n\nThanks much for any insights!",

It's actually quite simple. You can apply the display property to table cells too, even with a simple\n\ntd { display:block; float:left; width:50%; box-sizing:border-box }\n\nAnd there you have 2 columns. Of course you can also use flexbox and more refined methods to get the same results, and you should style the headers for better readability, but  that's it.\n\nA table is an element that semantically serves a purpose, and its code shouldn't be broken down just to appease presentation",

Other things you can do is use hidden and aria-hidden text inside the cells along with the data, so in mobile you can hide the headers and show that text styled as a label. Or use css content, although unadvisable for accessibility reasons. Just spitballing here mind you, not saying that it's ideal, as I said it's just fun trying to solve it (and unfortunately I've been in situations where I *had* to deal with tables that I could control only via css to make them readable on small screen).",

For example, restaurants that I know is run by chefs who's owner him/herself, and they're already busy doing their job. So the places I know doesn't have anyone and everybody doesn't have much time to learn and prepare for those tech things. Do they have time to do that?\n\nAnd are you ready to talk into them to spend more time just to match with your personal belief and preference of what-web-should-be? Try gathering numbers and statistics that doesn't involve your opinion is always the cool step to take. Try compressing PDF to eliminate rasterized fonts, font data and it might get slimmed down to the point it can be distributed without too much hassle on user end. But before going technical about it, maybe you want to listen to them first.\n\nI'm not sure how they make menus for print, but in case of PDF=menu for example: Say if they're making PDF first, they can print it and distribute the same file on web. Labor wise, that's super efficient! However if they had to update website, well they may have to make PDF anyways for print. Having two different menus might be usability and technologically more sophisticated, but if users (restaurant) aren't able to utilize it consistently, it doesn't mean much.\n\nSo you might have to come up with more elegant plan, such as edit only once on CMS and reflect both on website and menu. But design requirement for screen vs print media is often different, and I'm afraid that try solving it with media-query for printing won't cut it. (But you may want to give it a demo, however the last time I checked, the behavior was different from Browsers and printer drivers so I'm not involved with it for a long while.)",

So let's break it down (with the information you provided):\n\n`background-image: url(\"background1.jpg\");`\n\nfine.\n\n`background-size: fill;`\n\nmeans the image will fill the containing box either in height or width whatever boundary is reached first. But most likely you will have empty space right or bottom. What you want afaik is background-size: cover. So the containing box will always be filled entirely with the background image. This can - depending on the ratio and size of box and image - lead to zooming in.\n\n`background-repeat: no-repeat;`\n\nno need if cover.\n\n`background-position: fixed;`\n\ndoesn't exist. What you mean is background-attachment. But this will not work either since it will not use the size of the containing box but the size of the whole screen since it gets attached to it not to the box.\n\n`max-width: 100%;`\n\nno need, a div or any block element is not wider than that if not declared otherwise\n\n`min-width: 100%;`\n\nno need, a div or any block element is 100% if not declared otherwise\n\n`height: auto;`\n\nno need, a div or any block element will have height auto if not declared otherwise.\n\n`width: auto;`\n\nno need, a div or any block element is 100% no matter its content. If you want auto you have to declare display: inline-block.\n\nSo all what you need (with the provided infos):\n\n`.image1 {`\n\n`background-image: url(\"background1.jpg\");`\n\n`background-size: cover;`\n\n`background-position: center center;`\n\n`}`\n\nThis will let the block element always be 100% wide (default), auto height (default), center its background-image, fill the background-image to at least the container's boundaries and scale it down/up to show most of the image as possible.",

Then if you want them to overlap is you make the bottom row parent position:relative and put a top row parent with position:absolute and top:0.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have got a small issue with my responsive design. I have a couple of columns (see image 1) which are aligned in two different orders. I use the column class from SemanticUI. When I resize the window to a mobile-like size, the paragraphs are directly on top of each other (see image 2). Is there some way to change the box order?\n\nAdditionally, I have another picture (image 3) that is so small that the paragraph fits directly next to it, when I resize the page (image 4)\n\nI would love some tips/help from the more experienced web designers!\n\nYou can find my code and everything else, if you click the link.\n\nThank you very much!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u2IsbFTs-bafeptXXiCG2ryV0zp6ZWO9?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u2IsbFTs-bafeptXXiCG2ryV0zp6ZWO9?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image 1](https://preview.redd.it/uwocssxmez591.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=5da99367ec6cfcda4ae7f0d094814fea7303795c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image 2](https://preview.redd.it/qrfu8hroez591.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=005cb3395643b3a19a4e5d018ce703c9c8276d03)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image 3](https://preview.redd.it/nb12jxypez591.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e2733ce9d327357b5a44e3fd226d0b8dea691dd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image 4](https://preview.redd.it/evm1gegrez591.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc9dbedb6879dda207a675d5b9848ced55f2efc)\n\n&#x200B;",

It wouldn‚Äôt matter in this scenario if say the images are decoration only, but expectation of navigation is a core fundamental of WCAG.  \n\nAlso a lot of users with visual impairments(blurred or low vision) will increase the browser zoom upwards to 200-350% on desktop.  This will trigger mobile breakpoints - and could move items to new areas with your UX.  This not only is frustrating, but If someone with say a cognitive and visual impairment, they could be completely lost on what is happening.  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs best to secure DOM order over changing visual order.\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C27",

The only reason I enter size into the mix is because it is quantifiable; it shows my dedication in a clear number, and it can be used to compare it to websites of a similar type. Because \"funny\" is subjective, I only use quantifiable numbers to compare my website to others. Is it funny to me? Yes. To me, it is the worst in the world, but that is subjective. \n\nI do not know how bad your clients are at websites, but I would argue that mine is so bad that nobody could accidentally make something so atrocious, only if they were intending to create a bad website could they. That is what I argue. And you mentioned the speed, well that is a result of the massive size, further making the website worse. I cannot control the speed, and I do not want to reduce the size to increase speed. \n\nI would also argue that the content of the website is unique to me. The visual style may look very 90s, but I have not seen any website with similar content. This is largely because 95% of the content came from me. If you have examples of websites with similar content, I would love to see them. \n\nKeep in mind that the site is not just visually bad; in fact the aesthetic is just how to the content is presented. The visuals are merely the icing on the cake, while the content is really what matters.

If you press it and wait you can actually browse my website from my website, so thats pretty cool.

You said you spent a decent amount of time on my website, but somehow did not read any of the content? Also why would you want to torture yourself by looking even at the small portion you have seen already. That doesn't make sense to me. \nI am not saying my website is the most unique or the worst, because those are subjective. I argue that my website is one of the worst, and that it is unique. \n\nI do not ask others to read the website to prove that it is unique. I tell the users: here is my website. If you want, take a look and maybe it will make you laugh. \nThey don't have to look at it, nothing changes for me based on the number of viewers I get, and I do not get paid. They willingly choose to look at my website, so you had better ask them. \n\nI implored you to look deeper because you have not seen very much of the website, which is obvious by you saying you have not read the content. The content is 95% of the website. You cannot judge a website by 5% of what it has after 2 minutes of looking at just the aesthetics. And you cannot judge my dedication because you have not seen hardly any of the website. \nThis is literally judging a book by its cover. It's like looking at the cover of a book and saying \"this is not unique. The author's dedication has done nothing to make this book unique\". How strong of an argument is that, with zero evidence, without even looking. There is a reason why lawyers actually look at the evidence with which they are going to argue. \n\nAnd you responded to my argument by saying it is not true, but are not willing to provide any evidence to support your argument. Keep in mind that my main goal is not to prove anything. I have nothing to prove. I think my website is unique, evidently a bunch of other Redditors do, but you may not think so; I don't really care either way. I did not make this to live up to your expectations or to argue that it is unique.\n\nAnd lastly, I have an issue with you telling me to put the content in a readable way - no. First of all, if you're trying to argue that my project of 3 years is not unique, how inclined do you think I am to listen to your suggestions? I would hope you know you that I have zero incentive to listen to your suggestion in any way shape or form. The way the content is presented is unique to me, and I will not change it because you found it to be unattractive. You know, I said it was a bad website for a reason. Did you seriously expect the content to be presented in an appealing manner?\nAt the end of the day, you chose to comment on my post. I did not make this website for you, and so I don't even know why you would waste your time telling me how to present my website. That's just bullshit.",

Because \"funny\" is subjective, I only use quantifiable numbers to compare my website to others. Is it funny to me? Yes. To me, it is the worst in the world, but that is subjective. \n\nYOUR dedication, unfortunately, doesn't do anything special for the site to make it unique - there is just more of it as I said before.

Why the hell would I put myself through that just to learn what I have already determined:  this site is bad on purpose but not in a unique way.  If you want me to read the content (assuming it isn't equally bad) then make an attempt to display in a useful way.

This is the email they sent:\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\n‚ÄúGood afternoon,\n\nMy name is Anton and I am a licensing specialist at the TypeType font design studio.\n\nWe noticed that you are using the commercial font on the ‚Äúredactedwebsite.com‚Äù website. Thank you for choosing a font from our studio!\n\nUnfortunately, we were unable to find your web license purchase. As the developers and exclusive rights holders of TypeType fonts, we regularly check our font licensee base.\n\nWe understand that there may have been an error that caused the font license not to appear in the database. Please give us a few minutes of your time so that we can verify your font license. We would appreciate if you send a proof of purchase (e.g., a copy of an electronic receipt) from a platform where the license was acquired (Myfonts, Fonts.com, etc.).\n\nIf you can verify your purchase in any other way, please also mention this in your reply letter.\n\nWe understand that in some rare cases there is no font license. Write back to me and I will help you solve the problem as quickly as possible, including offering a suitable TypeType font license. You will be able to pay for the license any way you like. As a bonus, I will give you a discount if you order the font directly from the studio.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nSoooo what do I do now? I didn‚Äôt realize a foundry would really go after people using the font for personal projects. Obviously they have a right to, but I don‚Äôt really want to buy this font I‚Äôd rather just change to a free one. I‚Äôve heard changing it isn‚Äôt enough though and they will sue you regardless unless you buy it. \n\nIs buying my only option to avoid lawsuit?\n\nUpdate: there‚Äôs some cool people in this thread but some of you need to relax and understand that not everyone knows everything. Maybe I‚Äôm dumb for not knowing this but I bet there‚Äôs a lot of people that also didn‚Äôt know.\n\nUpdate2: I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs important to read the license of any font you‚Äôre using even if it‚Äôs just your portfolio. Font foundries can and will find out who didn‚Äôt pay and will potentially take legal action if you don‚Äôt comply OR they will contact your hosting provider and shut down your site.\n\nUpdate3: the guy (or bot) in the email hasn‚Äôt responded but I‚Äôm going to change the font to Inter (as much as I‚Äôll miss my little Circular lookalike) and hopefully be done with all of this until I can afford to buy the font properly. \n\nFinal update: Comment from u/dracoumbra that sums up how to approach a situation like mine if anyone ever gets a similar email and finds this post later on:\n\n> Dear Pirate (affectionately),\n\n> You are infringing on TypeType's intellectual property. But that's ok! I mean, what's ok about it is that it was a mistake, and there are very easy paths to resolution.\n\n> To lend credulity to what I have to say, I have been a creative director for a global brand, and currently run anti-piracy campaigns for fortune 500 companies. I have been in your shoes, and the shoes of TypeType. Organizations like TypeType absolutely have a case against you that they can bring to court - but unless they're trying to make an example of you, which is rare, they won't. A single Cease and Desist letter from a reputable law firm will cost them more than a perpetual sale of the font license, so most organizations choose a commercial option for license regulation, ie: they'll scare you a tiny bit and ask you to purchase.\n\n> To mimic many responses in this thread, you have a few options: Buy the license (I recommend doing this), or stop using the font. If you buy the license, usually there is a clause that says they can't take you to court for any past infringement. You get peace of mind. If you simply stop using it, you remain susceptible to legal escalation. But again, that's extremely rare. The only thing you CAN'T do is continue using their IP without paying for it.\n\n> Most organization aren't running gotcha IP infringement honeypot campaigns to try to lure in unsuspecting graphic designers to extract punitive damages from them. Most organizations simply want the people who use their IP to pay for it. That's all.\n\n> This is not legal advice.",

I have been in your shoes, and the shoes of TypeType. Organizations like TypeType absolutely have a case against you that they can bring to court - but unless they're trying to make an example of you, which is rare, they won't. A single Cease and Desist letter from a reputable law firm will cost them more than a perpetual sale of the font license, so most organizations choose a commercial option for license regulation, ie: they'll scare you a tiny bit and ask you to purchase. \n\nTo mimic many responses in this thread, you have a few options: Buy the license (I recommend doing this), or stop using the font. If you buy the license, usually there is a clause that says they can't take you to court for any past infringement. You get peace of mind. If you simply stop using it, you remain susceptible to legal escalation. But again, that's extremely rare. The only thing you CAN'T do is continue using their IP without paying for it. \n\nMost organization aren't running gotcha IP infringement honeypot campaigns to try to lure in unsuspecting graphic designers to extract punitive damages from them.

Column shrink was never an issue - you had trouble with column wrap and the image was breaking out of it's flex container.\n\nFor the wrapping issue, you missed a nowrap on the column block. Also, your @media queries are forcing the flex to become 1 column so I commented them out)\n\nSecondly, image container. Flex respects element sizes. Its a feature, not a bug. If your content is bigger than its container, it just allows it to push out. So you have to tell the image to scale according to the width of the parent container (Fix: width:100% )\n\nThe figure element and inline css style from the image were removed to allow the new css properties to take effect\n\ncodepen:\nhttps://codepen.io/mikesheaio/pen/XWXvWqd\n\nedit: I also find it strange that youre trying to avoid the best features of flexbox.

I was not asking for a .psd where I can change the width like I do in a website .

        "selftext": "When designing responsive, mobile CSS using media queries, should I only consider breakpoints for devices that are currently in use? My approach, so far, has been to design media queries around relevant devices that may contain larger min and max screen sizes (e.g. iPhone 6, 6+, X) and to not consider smaller devices that tend to typically be older (e.g. iPhone 4, Galaxy S5).",

        "selftext": "Personally I am sad to be getting into design in an era where mobile is most traffic for websites, because my beautiful ideas for intuitive website layouts end up as compromised button menus etc that don't really guide the user through the website. For a lot of my projects, it's *important* that the user know that there are other sections of the website. At a glance they should have an idea of the full scope of what the website offers. Easy to do with a prominent menu on desktop, even an always visible menu, but you can't (shouldn't?) be having 4-5 menu options taking up the top of the screen and following the scroll on mobile. And hiding the menu behind a \"menu\" button makes it unlikely that a user coming in from search engines will see that the website has other sections and purposes to dive into. \n\nHas anyone a potential solution for accomplishing this? Or examples of mobile sites that do this well?\n\nAnd I would have to assume mobile websites that do this well have mobile-only pages, which is less tricky than making a responsive website that can serve both purposes?",

Uniqlo's mobile site comes to mind immediately but there are tons of others out there. Check out [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/08/bottom-navigation-pattern-mobile-web-pages/) on why bottom navigation is what we _should_ be doing nowadays that phones are getting huge.\n\nRegarding building responsive/adaptive websites, I think you should just take a refresher on modern css. Building websites that are usable on mobile doesn't rely on media queries that much anymore. The first thing that comes to mind is the [\"Look Ma, No Media Queries!\"](https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/) piece from css-tricks. Media queries should really be used in edge cases and for other things, rather than screen width breakpoints. Read the following:\n\nhttps://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/media-queries-responsive-design-2018/\n\nGrid and flex box are where it's at nowadays because they're responsive by default.
