What I basically need is for the parent to have `overflow: hidden` and the child `position: fixed` if the `fixed` wouldn't escape the parent.\n\nThe structure I'm working with:\n\n    <div class=\"top_section\"></div>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <div class=\"left_column\">\n        ...\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"sticky_block\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"bottom_section\"></div>\n\nThe `left_column` is a flex column containing multiple children, the size and amount of these determines the height of `container`. The `sticky_block` is the one I need to be vertically centered on the screen, and to the right of the `left_column`. \n\nAny advice on how I can achieve this, preferably in pure CSS?",

However, on the largest screen size if you shrink the viewport to the smallest size horizontally, the items look squished (because they are percentage based).  As the designer I'm okay with this design but I haven't seen very many modern looking sites have elements that squish when you resize it horizontally. \n\nMost either rearrange the material or simply remove it as the screen resizes and obviously there are min-values which hardcodes a minimum size for elements on the screen and prevents them from appearing squished. But I'm curious, is it generally bad practice these days to make the elements behave in this way when the screen is resized. ",

That seems contradictory, so maybe `:focus-within` isn't the solution here. Is there another element/use case that I'm not seeing?",

Unless adding woocommerce or super specific plugins such as payment gateways, wordfence etc I keep it minimal as possible.\n\nThis gives complete control over the design and no making compromises due to theme choice or being booted with spaghetti code.\n\nACF makes it so the layout and design control of pages is in the theme code, not the WP editor. You can then make the content editing as minimal or advanced as you need. Of course you can blend ACF fields to styles and layouts but that’s up to you eg: a select field for “card style” where each card contains the same title, content and image fields.\n\nI personally prefer this route as if building a client website they can’t mangle the layout or appearance and can still have flexibility through repeatable layout blocks and components through ACF if required.",

The first episode of the CSS Podcast from the Chrome Dev team is a great overview of this topic.\n\nIn WP builds, I generally give each section an anchor. Then I can specify the element within that section very easily.\n\nFor example, on a front page if I have a section \"about\" and want to style a certain image with the class \"history\", the low effort css with the highest specificity would be:\n\nsection#about img.history { ...... }\n\nThese are general principals, but learning them helps to have more control in WP styling. I cannot stand Elementor, as it is so limiting. Honestly, my hand hurts after a couple hours of clicking around to find the right styling in the menus. Once you have a solid grasp of css, there is no limit to doing any layout with a simple starter theme (https://them.es) and hacking out a stylesheet to make it look sexy.",

The idea of an editable 'page' that has a title, content and meta-bits is great. The way the plugin and theme pool has monetized is not always that great.

When I build it, I have total control and don't need to pay for extras.\n\nI'll give in that it is nice to have some of the WordPress analytics already spun up for you in a UI, but to say WordPress is a high level web site builder that any company uses for anything other than a static About Us/Contact Us Launch page is a bit of an oversell.\n\nWith all that said, I'm thinking the downvotes are due to this being r/web_design and not r/webdevelopment.

This is the product archive that I have been working on. When I filter for all products, or just miter saws, my custom css works fine, but it breaks when it is just the table saw and tries to default to the widget's default styling. The widget I used is called Woo Product Grid.\n\nI've added images of the relevant sections of the css and the inspected html and I don't see any tags that are different that would be interrupting the styling, and the javascript is pulling the data from the same product archive, so I don't think it would be anything there either.\n\nEdit: All of the products are supposed to be in a div that looks like the ones for the miter saws, but it doesn't apply to the Table Saw when it's been filtered out by itself.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

Each column alternates bottom-to-top transition in, top-to-bottom transition in. Once the columns settle, the center image is scaled up into main view, while all other images are scaled down. When the center image reaches its maximum scaled up state, a video auto starts from the same point in the image.\n\nI have tried to replicate this transition with CSS, but cannot capture the same vibe (see below).

I usually wing it, as you say, because I can visualize most of the structure in my head already and I've done these kind of pages multiple times (*users lists, settings page, forms, tables, whatever*). I already know that most of the \"real\" content will come out as soon as I start coding it. You can \"imagine\" the basic elements (lists, drop down menus, avatars, ....) but every client has its own requirements. So I really love coding the entire structure via HTML/CSS and then style it in a different way, each time. My last \"control panel\" for a medical app [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/8U0eGvP.png) and it was in part inspired by something I've seen online (I save screenshots/template when I like something).\n\nFor **websites/ecommerces** it depends on what the client needs. If I get enough details (example: I want a big photo, 4 main clickable areas, a list of products, etc) I can draw it in my mind and CSS/HTML it already. Again, peeking at some screenshots helps me with palettes and fonts, sometimes. [This specific page/website](https://i.imgur.com/qGYOIZV.png) was designed on the go using the company's official leaflets/catalogues as an inspiration. I had something to \"visualize\" it in my head and I coded it already, no need to draw/mockup anything else.\n\nPWA projects are a middle ground between \"improvise\" and \"follow these bullet points\". So there is not a golden rule, for me at least. Each client is different. Generally speaking though, simple/technical PWA's are extremely easy to design in my opinion. I always use a FAB menu (floating button) as you can [see here](https://i.imgur.com/2CX9x4A.png) which [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/AiaPUW3.png) when you open it. Everything else is done via grid and some good stacking, it's not hard at all.\n\n[This one](https://micio.app/) (which will be my own freelance page) was coded in a boring afternoon while I was perfecting the best way to get [100/100/100/100](https://i.imgur.com/uSDZ0jU.png) on Chrome's Lighthouse (which really depends on your physical location too, I'm from Italy and the server is in UK).\n\nI am used to work with CSS/HTML already because it lets me play with mobile/desktop/responsive stuff while designing everything and I can test it on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, whatever (I use LambdaTest for multiple platform testing).

Or maybe let me try yellow and italic?*).\n\nBut that's just the barebone code to have the non-styled elements on the page. Some buttons, a table, an avatar, a drop-down list, etc. stuff that I know the app/page needs and I just want to organize and \"prettify\" with my css.\n\nBy doing so, I can style everything on the go (margins, colors, paddings, borders, ... ) as well as optimize and change the code for the mobile view. Very often I need to adapt something because the available data makes it look worse than a nice demo with perfect avatars and short, comfortable names. I can see how it behaves with weird content and adjust it in a second. A table with 10 columns is a good example, you really need to \"see it in action\" both on mobile and desktop to check if it works. What fields do I need on mobile? What structure do I apply to the table to make it easy to understand on a cellphone?\n\nCoding it makes it extremely easy to \"visualize\" it, in my opinion.",

They allow non-techs to build functioning web experiences for their business. But they have limitations and expectations for how a business runs, and will not be customizable outside of a certain set of boundaries. Sounds like that is  the point you are at right now. \n\nSo you have two options:\n\n - Bend the template as close as you can to the business needs and make due with whatever the discrepancy is\n - Hire someone to help you customize the experience.\n\nAs the kind of guy who gets hired to do something like this, I can't emphasize how much better the first option is going to be for you. If you can, in any way, get something that approximates meeting your needs up without hiring a dev, it's going to be worlds cheaper and will get finished. If you hire a dev, it could cost a lot of money, take a lot of time, and will still end up in some state of compromise. \n\nThis is 25 years of experience talking; if you can't make enough money back to justify hiring a dev (thousands of dollars) then you should settle for a site that does ~80% of what you want and go home happy.\n\nIt's not worth breaking down the technicals here too far, but what you're going to need at minimum is a custom WP plugin that does math the way you have envisioned. I am not sure what the going rate is on that, but I know it's not a one-shot deal; Wordpress continues to evolve and any custom work is going to need to stay upgraded. That means you need a dev who will be around, along with being capable of the work. That's basically not a thing, despite any assurances someone provides you. The website may have a shelf life of like 10 years. Do you want to assume the dev's life will stay static, and that their rate of pay will stay stable, etc.? \n\nHopefully that makes the point well enough. \n\nThe one thing I would offer as a piece of technical advice, is that it sounds like you could, if you really wanted to, solve the quote wizard piece with a Google form with custom scripting. That would at least give a solution that isn't coupled to a CMS, but it would possibly be weird, still cost money or cause you to have to pass a steep learning curve, and would end up being a compromise. \n\nMuch luck to you. I hope it works out!",

From your description it seems like the biggest problems are\\\\\n\n* organizing and confirming with people (so gathering information about what they want)\n* calculating the quote based on gathered data\n* making the process fully self-service (no communications with a real person)\n\nTackling all of them at the same time would be too big of a bite IMO, but each part on its own is manageable.\n\nFor the order information gathering part, I'd start with this:\n\n* Review existing email / communication threads with past clients and see what the most common topics that need clarification are\n* Create a comprehensive list of what you absolutely need to know for each type of order based on your findings\n* If required, draw a branching logic flow for each service type (e.g. if customer needs three-color screen print, also ask *which* three colors are needed and so on)\n* Try out [typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) to create this flow. Typeform lets you create logic-based flows, upload files, require number-based answers etc; I think it should be possible to most types of questions you'd need.\n* Boom, you now have the information gathering part done. Typeform will send you all the information once the customer has answered all questions in the flow.\n\nNext part is the quote calculation. \n\n* Typeform allows performing calculations on the provided answers - say, multiply item amount with the cost corresponding to the chosen print area size. It may be finicky to implement, but you don't need any web development skills to do it.\n* If Typeform doesn't fit the bill for quote calculations, you can try [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) integration and put all the [Typeforms data into a Google form](https://zapier.com/apps/google-forms/integrations/typeform), which might be a more familiar environment. Zapier can also do multiple things - once Typeform is filled out and quote is calculated, you can send the gathered information + the quote to the clients provided email, for example. It lets you integrate with a bunch of software with no-code automations.\n* This part might be the most hard, but I think it's still doable on your own. Boom, you now have both data gathering + quote calculation done.\n\nNext part is making it all fully self-service, like include payments and have a button to click that confirms the order, etc. Maybe it turns out that you don't really need it and the process works fine already; maybe you decide you want to make it all more permanent and create a custom solution. The great thing is that at this point, you would have a working prototype, which serves as documentation for whoever you would hire. You could say \"I need a solution that abides by the same logic, but also does payments\", which is much easier to quote and estimate for the contractor instead of a vague description. Also that saves you money - someone would still need to figure out all that aforementioned stuff out on paper, and it takes billable hours.\n\nHope you find some of this valuable, and good luck!",

This means the `search-bar` will inherit styles from the form. There’s no necessary connection for an element with the class `search-bar` if it’s not within a form, especially since you've used a `div`.\n\nIt seems like you’re asking if creating a search bar outside of a form would still inherit styles from the form. The answer is no; it won’t inherit those styles unless it’s inside the form.\n\n**Please stop opening the same topic in multiple groups.

        "selftext": "Sorry for the vague title. I'm not sure where else to go for this so I figured I would start here. I'm trying to set up a communications/correspondence system for my stepdad. He makes money by buying tractors, fixing them up, and selling them. He's great with that stuff, but he's very tech illiterate. He seems to operate fine by word of mouth but there's only so many people in our area who need tractors, y'know? He wants to be able to reach more people, so he floated the idea to me that I list his tractors on Facebook marketplace, but I don't want to do that because it would be through my account and I don't want to be the middleman, mainly because I *will* forget. So I was thinking about setting up a website for him since that would offer a way for him to receive messages directly without having to go through me, and I would just manage listings and maintenance, maybe not even maintenance if I just use a website platform. He doesn't have an email address (we are talking very old school, very tech un-savvy here), and I know that the way most websites receive correspondence from visitors is through email. My question is: is there a way to set it up so that any messages the website receives, they would go directly to my stepdad's text messages? I'm pretty sure he knows how to text, but at the very least I could specify that potential customers just need to include their phone number, and I can show him how to make calls from numbers sent in the body of a text message since that's basically child's play for someone like me who knows their way around basic smartphone functions. Thank you in advance! Or if you know of a more appropriate alley for me to post this, thank you for sending me that way! ",

I found out that they just don't work.\n\nWhat I want to fond is a CMS that would work like subscription-based services (\\*folio, tilda, \\*respace, etc) but on my own server without subscription, maybe with 1-time purchase if the product is working. I need to have it all in one place, my place.\n\nI'm using Wordpress right now for years already but it is not a portfolio engine. It has too much of unnecessary features that I'm not utilizing and they make it clunky and very limited. And it has very cluttered theme engine that makes it complicated to make templates quickly. Its own themes don't allow a lot of things that modern portfolio websites use. So Wordpress is half-measure which gives half-result.\n\nMaybe you know some decent portfolio CMS?",

                "body": "**Position**\n\nDon't think of `position` as a property with which you can define the *position* of an element, but as a property with which you can define the *positioning method* of an element, and how it interacts with the elements close to it, e.g. parents, children, siblings.\n\n* `static`: The default. The element will \"go with the flow\" of the document. If you have three elements they will generally be displayed next to each other or below each other (depending on `display`), not on top of each other. Other than that `static` is very non-confrontational regarding elements around it.\n* `relative`: Acts a lot like `static` but can be positioned with directional properties (`top`, `left`, etc.). Any absolutely positioned children (or children of children etc.) will be positioned relative to this element.\n* `fixed`: Doesn't give a shit about its surroundings. Acts like a postit on your screen. If you scroll down its still there. If you set `top` to `0` the element will be put at the top of your screen and stay there. Note that all the properties of `relative` also apply here (with children being positioned relative to this one).\n* `absolute`: If you have three elements below each other and you give the middle one `position: absolute`, the third element will be put where the second one used to be, whereas the middle one is on top of it. If you don't give the absolutely positioned element any position (with `top`, `left`, etc.) it'll still be where it was when it was static, but if you do give it a position, those properties will be relative to its closest `relative` parent or, if there is no relative parent, the document. If you scroll the page, the element will scroll like this text you are reading if you scroll. Note that all the properties of `relative` also apply here (with children being positioned relative to this one).\n* `sticky`: Quite a new addition. The basic idea is to make an element act like `fixed` as long as its parent is visible and the element itself is visible in its entirety, but like `absolute` if those conditions are not met. It \"sticks\" to its parent, so to speak, a bit like a scrollbar of an element on a page that also scrolls.\n\nWith all \"positions\" other than `static` you can use `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` to define the actual position and `z-index` to define the \"stacking order\"\n\n**z-index**\n\nDoesn't work for `position: static` at all. In all other cases a higher `z-index` generally means it's more to the \"front\". If you have a blue element with a `z-index` of `1` and a red element with a `z-index` of `2` and you place them on top of each other, the red one will be \"on top\", no matter which one comes first in the HTML.\n\nTake the following structure.\n\n    <div class=\"a\">\n      <div class=\"b\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"c\"></div>\n\nLet's say that `a` has a `static` position and `b` and `c` are relatively positioned. In this case, if `b` has a higher `z-index` than `c`, `b` will be on top of `c`.\n\nHowever, let's now say that all three elements are relatively positioned. `a` has a `z-index` of 1, `b` has a `z-index` of **20** and `c` has a `z-index` of `3`. Now `c` will be on top of both `a` and `b`. The `z-index` of `b` is \"ignored\" because it's contained within `a`, which is *not* `static`. But if there were an element `d`, also within `a`, which had a `z-index` of `5`, it would be below `b`. `b` and `d` are in a different \"stacking context\" than `a` and `c`.\n\nKeep in mind that all of those rules regarding `z-index` would apply even if `b` were `absolute` for example.\n\nI think that's about everything.",

If the parent element is static on the other hand, the absolutely positioned child will \"ignore\" that specific parent and instead be positioned relative to its closest relative container (e.g. parent of parent, or further up) or ultimately the document if there's no relative parent element.",

                "body": "I think you have a good base there. Here are some thoughts from a UI standpoint:\n\n* At first glance, of even just the preview image, the layout looks a bit floaty with the white  panel centered and then two sand coloured panels either side. You might anchor it better by using a darker colour on the left panel, or even on the nav, and then short of getting lighter as you make your way to the right. Does that make sense? It would also add some hierarchy. The last panel should be the most important but there's noting visually to indicate that, for example you could float it above the rest of the page with a soft shadow along it's left edge, so it's visually closer to the user.\n* Look at heading sizes, much of the text is the same size and it means your eye gets lost as you start looking around with no clear vertical direction. You might need one at the top of each 3 sections too.\n* You say it's for movies, books and shows, but there's not much to indicate it, especially with IP's that are across different media. Is that what category is, to choose media type? Does 'Director' and the other dropdown only display according to the category? Also add tags within item descriptions, eg 'The Owl House' = 'TV Series, Series 3'.\n* At the bottom of the right panel you also have 'Watched' which wouldn't be appropriate for a book, so you could rename it to 'Time spent on' or something similar.\n* The buttons and filters could use the same font size. Maybe 'Remove' could be outlined with clear fill for differentiation. How about adding icons next to the button text too.\n* Where you have the rating slider, I'd also add a manual input here for accessibility.\n* The rating itself could look a bit more exciting as well, right? Could make it bigger, pull it out next to a bigger title, increase the colour saturation the higher the score is, add thumb up icon if it's good - things like that.\n* Edit - I just noticed the third panel is actually a popup and might not there be constantly. If so, what fills that space otherwise? Could you expand the center list to 2 or 3 columns of content instead?\n\nHope that helps!",

I tried revisiting some of them throughout the day and quickly realized that it is a pain to navigate through these sites - most of their useful information is not hard-linked through the menu bar, but requires of me to scroll through various animations starting with an almost blank header full-width section which does nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It seems to me that most of these \"modern\" webs are trying to look like a book with a cover. Some of these covers end up being very bland, offering almost no information and require potential visitors to really \"scroll through the book\" in order to get some ideas behind what the website and company are all about. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs this specifically done on purpose to make the customer spend more time on the website?\n\n**What are your thoughts on this?**",

Keep it very simple and plain, and then let users discover their way to what they need. \n\nAlso, there's some old idea still going around that you need to cram as much information in above the fold as possible. Not true. I'm so tired of working with people obsessed with keeping content above the fold and sacrificing \"breathability\" in the design for it. [Above the fold is a myth](http://abovethefold.fyi/). People scroll and explore by habit.\n\n**Why are modern sites using hamburger menus?**\n\nI would say it's most likely due to lazy design practice. It's a way bigger effort to make different menu styles for desktop vs tablet/mobile so developers just make the hamburger menu because it *works* on desktop too. It's the least common denominator in a way. Also, a lot of websites have a majority of their users coming from the mobile platforms and not PCs, so this is clearly prioritized.\n\n**Do they assume a user only visits once?**\n\nMore often than not, yes. Also, the way most websites are structured is to be able to measure conversion rates. You want a funnel that you can lead users through and be able to measure and improve. \n\nBtw, the book \"Hello, Startup\" talks about all these points in a very easy to understand way. Can't recommend it enough.",

Here's an article on NNG about folds in web design: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/page-fold-manifesto/\n\nBy having a full-bleed header image on your site, you risk creating those \"artificial floors\" referenced in the article. You also waste above-the-fold space, where users spend *most* of their time.\n\nIt can be done effectively--it works best when the page is telling a story. So it wouldn't be suitable for the homepage for something like Amazon, but it could work for a page selling an individual product--where it's telling you the product's story.\n\nTake a look at the Adobe website. The homepage is just the header navigation, a \"start trial\" button, and three boxes directing visitors to the sections most relevant to them. They can't have a long page telling a \"story\" for their homepage because they have so many products and different target customers. \n\nHowever, when you go to the detail view for a specific product (e.g. https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?promoid=RL89NFBP&mv=other ) it does have a (nearly) full-screen header with a small amount of text. They also left a white border at the bottom to avoid creating the aforementioned \"artificial floors\". The header section has the most important content--the \"start trial\" and the \"buy now\" buttons--so people who are already familiar with/don't want to bother reading all the details can skip straight to those steps. And when you scroll, it tells you more details, shows you examples, and tells you a \"story\".\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that although above the fold content remains the most important part of many pages, it is becoming less so https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolling-and-attention/ \n\nAnother point to consider is that doing this might cause some degree of \"banner blindness\" like what happens with carousels, where users immediately scroll without looking at the content at all, just to get it out of the viewport.\n\n#Hamburger Navigation\n\nI guess it could be used to direct the visitor's attention, but generally considered bad UX design: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/\n\n#Are these modern web sites assuming that their potential customer will visit their site only once\n\nThat's an interesting point. It's also not unreasonable, for many products, although good UX design allows for multiple ways to get to the same point, so they should always have navigation to skip to a specific section.",

But NOW, it's become a standard UI component.  If thought goes into information architecture, hamburgers aren't an issue, because everyone knows that \"about\", \"Contact\", \"Settings\" etc are behind the hamburger.  That being said, often times it's still a matter of \"Everyone else has a hamburger, I want one too\" lazy design.\n\nJust my 2 cents.",

I would love to learn this way, and be able to edit people's WP sites this way so I can show them my vision for improvements to their pre-existing sites.\n\nThanks for the help wp gang!",

Option A: Make the box appear full-width and be scrollable*\n\nTry wrapping the table in a <div> tag like this:\n\n`<div style=\"display: block; max-width: 100%; overflow: auto; white-space: nowrap;\">`\n\n`...table code...`\n\n`</div>`\n\nThe max-width and overflow values should force the table to be scrollable horizontally in cases where it's too wide to fit naturally. The white-space property tells text objects they can't wrap around and should only be 1 line unless there's an actual line break. The white-space bit may be better applied to your table cells (td elments) in CSS to be sure your text will be affected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*2. Option 2: Doing a vertical list instead of a table*\n\nYour information in this case actually doesn't make sense as a table. The left->right orientation of properties is great for when multiple items are being presented, but you only have 2 total rows in your table, heading and 1 set of values. Presenting *one* set of key/value pairs at a time is easier for humans to parse as a list like this:\n\n>Points: 10000000  \n>  \n>Coupon Code: QBYZR  \n>  \n>Amount Left: $10000000  \n>  \n>...*etc*\n\nSo, for that you can use a basic list:\n\n`<ul><li><b>Points</b>: 10000000</li><li><b>Coupon Code</b>: QBYZR</li><li><b>Amount Left</b>: $10000000</li></ul>`\n\nIf you don't want the basic list styling with • symbols, do `padding-left: 0;` on the <ul> and `list-style: none;` on the <li> tags",

Most of the YouTubes I watched before I started used Elementor, which seems to make a kind of sense, so I am using Elementor as well. \n\nI spent like 12 hours of my Saturday carefully crafting 31 pages of content for my new .com. I'm now working on my homepage, and the WHOLE CONCEPT - the only way my idea works - is that there's a button at the bottom, and clicking it takes you to a different, random one of the 31 (and growing) child pages. Then a button at the bottom of each of those pages that does the same thing.  \n\nGoogle produces results for how to generate a random link, but only if you're raw-coding or how to create a link in Elementor just in general with no mention of random. Of course there are plug-ins for WordPress but none work with Elementor. I don't feel like paying $89 to unlock functionality in some app that will let me do it because I don't expect I'll ever make a dime from this site - it's for the lulz but I'll freely admit it's the kind of thing you go once, you go \"Haaaaa!\" and you'll never go back.  \n\nCan someone explain to me a method for executing this functionality in a way that will work with my Elementor pages?",

        "author": "RabbitsFoot8",
        "id": "jenw5y",
        "selftext": "A few weeks ago [**tiiny.host**](https://tiiny.host) (a simple way to share your web project) launched a deal but presented it in a creative way:\n\n[Original order-based price tiered component](https://preview.redd.it/o48wkiv4m8u51.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b84a96f499f1ac9fafdfd021096b8294e43068)\n\nA few asked how it was made so I wanted to break it down for others.\n\nThe original was created with react & bootstrap so I re-created it in pure HTML & CSS to breakdown it's components. Feel free to use the component yourself if you like it :)\n\n\\---------------\n\nThe container is a simple, rounded rectangle with a white background featuring two child divs:\n\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <div class=\"price-tiers-container\">\n    \n        <!-- Prices tiers go here -->\n    \n      </div>\n      <div class=\"features-container\">\n    \n        <!-- Prices tiers go here -->\n    \n      </div>\n    </div>\n\nLet’s look at the price tiers first. These contained three further divs wrapped by the price-tiers-container class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price-tiers container](https://preview.redd.it/j1rade27m8u51.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2d3f848c97cc461d7cb9c472064bce2ad0cd94)\n\nIn order to make the divs extend out of it’s parent container class we needed to apply the `position: absolute` for price-tiers-container. We also ensured it had a fixed width and used a flex layout to divide the space amongst the three price tiers.\n\nThe final class looked like this:\n\n    .price-tiers-container {\n        display: flex;\n        position: absolute;\n        width: 530px;\n    }\n\nWithin this we have three price-tier divs with these styles:\n\n    .price-tier {\n        flex: 3;\n    \n        display: flex;\n        flex-direction: column;\n        justify-content: space-between;\n    \n        background: white;\n        border: solid 2px #c1c1c1;\n        border-radius: 8px;\n        margin-top: 10px;\n        margin-left: 10px;\n        padding: 12px;\n    }\n\nEach price-tier is given a default equal width by setting flex of 3 (but the active one is flex: 4). We also use flex to align items within the price-tier div and space the items evenly using `justify-content: space-between`. Finally we apply some individual border, padding etc styles.\n\nWithin each price tier we just have three divs:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Non-active price tier](https://preview.redd.it/8invrrs8m8u51.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&s=017fe020054d8fec8ef1fe4c4b267b1a9c1381ec)\n\n    .title {\n        color: grey;\n    }\n    \n    .price {\n        font-size: 1.5rem;\n    }\n    \n    .price-period {\n        font-size: 0.7rem;\n    }\n    \n    .label {\n        font-size: 0.8rem;\n    }\n    \n    <div class=\"price-tier\">\n      <div class=\"title\">\n        Stage 2\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"price\">\n        <b>$99</b><span class=\"price-period\"> / onetime</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"label\">Coming soon</div>\n    </div>\n\nWith the active price tier, the set up is slightly different:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Active price tier](https://preview.redd.it/so79jrt9m8u51.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1138ba16d1ee9c13e96d58e13363853b5d3393c)\n\n    .active {\n        border-color: blue;\n        flex: 4 **!important**;\n        height: 150px;\n    }\n    \n    <div class=\"price-tier active\">\n      <div class=\"p-title\">\n        Stage 1\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"price\">\n        <b>$59</b><span class=\"price-period\"> / onetime</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"progress-bar\">\n        3/50 sold\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\nThe active price-tier swaps out the label for a progress-bar and applies the active class as well. To make it more prominent we assign it a fixed height, override the default `border-color` and increase the flex to 4.\n\nAdditionally, we grey out the content in the non-active price-tiers like so:\n\n    .price-tier > div {\n        opacity: 0.4;\n    }\n    \n    .active > div {\n        opacity: 1;\n    }\n\nFinally in order to make the progress bar in the active price tier we use a css-gradient trick:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Progress bar](https://preview.redd.it/et7ay62bm8u51.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3f9e7157f8ee9004836a0c8dc09933ffe06906)\n\n    .p-progress-bar {\n        background: linear-gradient(90deg, #2BC147 0%, #2BC147 15%, #575757 15%, #575757 100%);\n        color: white;\n        border-radius: 8px;\n        width: 100%;\n        font-size: 0.7rem;\n    }\n\nWe set the background to 90 degree but set the green `(#2BC147)` at 0% and 15% and the the grey `(#575757)` at 15% and 100%. This gives the illusion of a progress bar. If we need to increase the progress then we just modify 15% to the new progress level.\n\nFinally, we complete the features-container:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Features container](https://preview.redd.it/7m1tgumgm8u51.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=4727576cc44b01adc208ad7e1b6739e89a6692ec)\n\n    .features-container {\n        display: flex;\n        flex-wrap: wrap;\n        justify-content: center;\n        padding: 168px 12px 12px 12px;\n        align-content: space-evenly;\n    }\n    \n    .feature::before {\n        content: '✅ ';\n    }\n    \n    .feature {\n        margin: 3px;\n        font-size: 0.8rem;\n    }\n    \n    <div class=\"features-container\">\n      <div class=\"feature\">This feature</div>\n      <div class=\"feature\">And this</div>\n      <div class=\"feature\">Great at this</div>\n      <div class=\"feature\">Plus this feature</div>\n    </div>\n\nHere, we use a flex layout again and set `align-content: space-evenly` to evenly space the list of features within the container.\n\nWe apply large top padding of `168px` to leave space for the `pricing-tier-container`. This is because it has `position: absolute` meaning it takes no space in parent div. In order for it to not overlap we reserve artificial space for it.\n\nWe apply a `::before` selector to each feature and set the content to a tick emoji (you can use anything) to add ticks to each item.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Putting it altogether in pure CSS & HTML](https://preview.redd.it/nbxvtxjcm8u51.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9911add169906382d8b628bee2a3a78210f9990)\n\nAnd that’s it!

Of course, this would be true if all the child elements of the newly established BFC were all block-level child elements, but inline-level child elements of the newly established BFC would be, of course, laid out next to one another.\n\nSo, is MDN's statement incorrect, or do I have a misunderstanding of it?",

In either event stick to editing the child theme after looking to see if the original theme's author specifies a specific means to update the CSS.\n\nAlso, look to see to make sure that the logo file is not being coded with WordPress's own functions to place an image file into the website. In your browser, right click on the logo, then select \"INSPECT\". In the \"Elements\" tab in the inspection dialog, i.e., the code that comes up in the inspection tool, look to see if you can see a URL pointing to the logo file. If so, it is likely WordPress has been coded to load the image file into the code directly, rather than the CSS having been setup to use  \"background-image\". If you look within the \"Style\" tab and scroll around, you may see a background-image being defined for the logo.",

I have been studying web development for around 3 years, picking up freelance projects along the way.\n\nI have an extreme love for code and programming(using React or Gatsby.js). But I am in a bit of a pickle, because building websites from scratch with these technologies is time-consuming, which makes it hard to make a comfortable living when dealing with the majority of the small businesses I do work for.\n\nThankfully WordPress has been a great lifesaver, as it comes with a lot of functionality out of the box, and most people are familiar with it, or at the very least have heard of it. However, I feel like I lack the design freedom that I have through hand-coding websites. Even child themes can be time-consuming and challenging, especially when trying to execute specific designs that clients want.\n\nI have recently started to work on a project with Divi, but I just feel like it is going against my nature as a developer, should I get over this? Has anyone been in a similar situation? What are your thoughts?\n\nI appreciate all answers.\n\nAnd apologies in advance if this is not the right place for this question.",

Even simpler, you can stack your absolute positioned slides (divs with background images, that’s what I mean, so you can have an image with text on it as well) on top of each other and animate their opacity. Again, if you want to keep things suuuper  basic.\n\nYour keyframes read: bounce from 0% to 100% height twice every 10 seconds, but apply the animation with 3 seconds delays to the slides. Which means that when the first slide is going to be on its 50% or 5 seconds (100 % height) the second slide will be on its, what, 2 nd out of 10 seconds, so 20% of the animation? It does not add up, imho. Plus, because you set the image width to be auto, the browser calculates its width for you, the image will resize on its height without losing the proportion (if I’m correct), so they will scale on both dimensions without losing proportion.\n\nI don’t know man, there are plenty of css slideshow examples you can learn from (try w3school), this one is a good exercise to learn, but it won’t work the way it currently is. \nI found the resource you used to reach this result, but the code is very different, the timing is too and, by itself, it’s really not a good execution.

        "title": "How to create a drop-down nav menu with CSS",
        "author": "gf99b",
        "id": "en0v1r",
        "selftext": "First - I'm new here. I did web design in high school but stopped doing it for a while. I'm currently a junior in college who recently got burned out on what I'm actually doing (journalism) so I decided to press restart on my web design career and learn more. (Unfortunately, I'm so far along in my present major and my school doesn't offer a web design program so I'm having to teach myself a lot.) Thanks to some renewed interest, confidence, W3Schools and help from a mentor on campus, I was able to learn the basics of responsive design and I'm eventually going to turn my standalone site into a WordPress-based site.\n\nBut I'm going to have some questions along the way. I've posted some questions on StackOverflow but the response wasn't that good, so I thought I'd try this subreddit. I apologize if any of my questions are dumb questions.\n\nMy first problem is about a drop-down menu I'm trying to implement into my design. I used a flexbox as a \"container\" for my navigation bar, and each menu item is essentially an item in an unordered list. It appears to be a pretty standard setup. Something like this, where the \"ul.nav\" class is for the flexbox, and \"li.nitem\" is the styling for the individual list items. It functions perfectly.\n\n    <ul class=\"nav\">\n        <li class=\"nitem\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 1\">Item 1</a></li>\n        <li class=\"nitem\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 2\">Item 2</a></li>\n        <li class=\"nitem\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 3\">Item 3</a></li>\n    </ul>\n\nThe hitch comes to when I try to add a drop-down menu. The menu is a horizontal menu that is in the same row as my logo, so space is limited. I followed [this tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/solved-with-css-dropdown-menus/) and it makes sense until I try to implement it myself. I keep getting hung up on the classes.\n\nI gather that `ul li ul` will affect the second-tier list and `ul li ul li` will affect the individual items in that second tier list. But how can I translate that into using my styles? Obviously, I may have other lists on a page and I'm worried that using standard ul and li may affect those lists.\n\nI was thinking of doing something like this, where \"ul.nav\" is still the flexbox for the entire menu, \"li.ni1\" is styling for first-tier items, \"ul.ndd2\" is the second-tier list, and \"li.ni2\" is the second-tier items. Obviously I know how to implement this in the HTML, but not sure how to get the CSS to work for it. I tried replacing the longer ul/li chains with the classes (for example, `ul li ul li` would become `li.ni2`.)\n\n    <ul class=\"nav\">\n        <li class=\"ni1\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 1\">Item 1</a></li>\n        <li class=\"ni1\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 2\" aria-haspopup=\"true\">Item 2</a>\n            <ul class=\"ndd2\" aria-label=\"Dropdown\">\n                <li class=\"ni2\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item A\">Item A</a></li>\n                <li class=\"ni2\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item B\">Item B</a></li>\n            </ul></li>\n        <li class=\"ni1\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Item 3\">Item 3</a></li>\n    </ul>\n\nAlso, in the CSS on the tutorial site (and others) I've noticed something like this.\n\n    ul li:hover > ul,\n    ul li:focus-within > ul,\n    ul li ul:hover,\n    ul li ul:focus {\n       visibility: visible;\n       opacity: 1;\n       display: block;\n    }\n\nThis may be another dumb question, but what is the function of the `>` greater-than sign?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Once again, I'm sorry if this is a dumb question or not the right place to post a question.",

Frankly it is all about making $$$$$$ for the agency.   The Agency can easily can use the excessive web site in part of their sales press and distract the customer to spend the big bucks.   In the end the site does nothign for the actual user and may even turn off the customer, however the agency make big bank on the project.\n\nFrankly this is why B to B sites, from the larger companies, have in house development teams.

And then ultimately I just want to deal with the frame and not worry about the children inside. I just want all that logic encapsulated in the frame. I JUST WANT TO DEAL WITH THE FRAME. If I change the size of the frame, the children inside should automatically change and preserve all the current ratios.\n\nHowever setting the position of the children to absolute is just one of the things that is causing HAVOC. It seems like once I do that, it is not resizing automatically with the frame. When I change the screen size, the children are leaking out of the frame.

I actually had a boss once that said, \"Never use purple, I hate purple.\" I looked at him and said, \"Man if the rock star Prince were to walk through the door and ask us to make him some promo materials you can bet your ass I'm using purple.\" That job was the last job I worked as a full time designer. The hard part about it is that I love to design, and all my training was in design. I was already dabbling in front end development at the time, but I buried myself in learning everything I could about development. This was long ago, when web design was still done in photoshop and then handed off to a developer. Worked as a front end developer for a few years, then started picking up back end development, and ultimately became a full stack developer. Last couple years I ran a business as CTO with a couple other guys, and ultimately sold that business this year. I'm no longer very involved with design professionally, and it's really hard to get employers to recognize that you have design skills when they just see you as a programmer.

Around 2001 or 2002 I discovered Drupal, which solved most of my development problems (including the site's 40 or so database-driven forms, its security, account management, paging, navigation....)

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a beginner in html/css and these days I'm practicing my skills by cloning existing homepages. \n\nNow that I've completed my [flickr.com](https://flickr.com) homepage clone, **I'm trying to copy the** [**yelp.com**](https://yelp.com) **homepage (Italian version)**. \n\nThe homepage of Yelp is giving me a massive headache cause there are **basically two things I'm struggling with**:\n\n**1)** the top area of the page is structured in basically 2 rows (see screenshots below). So far nothing weird. The problem is that: it seems to be a massive number of parent <div> and children <div> covering the same areas. That makes me wonder: \"is that REALLY necessary?\". If you can spend a minute inspecting the page, you'll understand what I mean. I'm trying to keep the whole thing simple in my little project here, but I really wonder if I need so many other tools to get the same result;\n\n**2)** this second doubt is more simple: I can't really figure out how they can keep the <div> in the second row (the one with the words Ristoranti, Servizi per la casa, Servizi per auto, Altro)  perfectly left-paired and aligned to the above search bar, even when you gradually resize the viewport. I used the Inspect tool, and basically I saw that they added margin and padding to fill the empty gap on the left of that <div> (again, see screenshots below). But I really can't understand how that kind of solution can work in responsive mode, since they set fixed padding and margin there. \n\nThank you to all those who will find the time to look into this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m33lqs3n6yr91.png?width=1823&format=png&auto=webp&s=942564e570e9292eba2e0dc52cd944fa83596803\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vvp6r3n6yr91.png?width=1817&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cdd9be16375742d832e573d9b9c2df6ed576e20\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clwfzr3n6yr91.png?width=1790&format=png&auto=webp&s=279a9ae7f30416fd84db429d15049c1274b47446",

I learned the hard way that when I code some static page, some markup hierarchy is always bound to change once it gets churned by the framework the devs work with. so for example, I can't trust using ::first, ::last, ::nth-child(even) and stuff like that, but I need to rely on more robust methods (hard-coded class names or js)\n\nedit: about your second question, they used a clever trick. for smaller viewports, there's just some margin on the left side of the menu, equal to the width of the logo above it. the logo has a fixed width (112px including its own padding), so the row below it has a margin-left of 112px\n\nfor bigger viewports, they added this:\n\n    padding-left: calc((100vw - 1144px) / 2 - 161px);\n\nwhich means 100% of the viewport, minus 1144px (which I guess is the outer grid width), divided by 2 minus 161px. I'm not completely sure where does the 161px comes from, but I think the whole thing compiles to 0 (or less than 0) on smaller viewports, so there's no padding. while on bigger viewports it \"imitates\" the gap between the logo and the search bar, so a padding equal to that gap is added.",

How means statically vs dynamically. You write the HTML for your page statically, or by-hand. What Yelp and other developers are doing is adding in a dynamic element to it.\n\nInstead of writing 3 divs directly onto the page by hand, they may have written a Javascript (the final piece to your journey) method that actually *builds those divs for them*. Think about it.. maybe there are 10 pizza shops, maybe 100. You can't code that Statically, so you need Javascript to build those assets for you, inject the proper data, then load them on the page.\n\nThats why the end structure can become chaotic looking. There are ways to optimize later, but I'm personally a fan of more compartments (divs), as there are deeper layers to effect and build. Anytime a design gets complex or needs to be reused, styled thematically, etc., more divs is usually part of it.\n\nI learned web dev in a similar path as you.

I think what you mean by \"total responsiveness\" is a liquid layout, where every element's size is always defined as a percentage of its parent. it's definitely an option, but it's pretty rare to be able to build an entire website (or even a page) just doing that. In real case scenarios nearly all components will need precise fine tuning to look \"good\", especially if you're working with a submitted design that you need to follow.\n\ncase in point: yelp guys most probably didn't want their logo to be HUGE when viewed on widescreen monitors, and tiny AF when viewed on small tablets (I'm excluding mobiles since I saw that they have a separate site for that). so they defined their logo to be 120px wide because they thought it looked good on every viewport. even for a simple case like that, you can't be \"full responsive\": once you define a \"static\" size for an element, it means that all the calculations made around it need to use predefined sizes. in this case, the gap around the logo becomes a product of the width of said logo and the width of the other elements elements that populate that area\n\nlastly, don't focus too much on \"not getting used to bad practices\". personally I think going through the muck is the only way to properly learn how stuff work. Trying to do the \"right thing\" from the get go, most times mean just copy-pasting over complicated code that maybe you can barely understand. on the other hand, implementing stuff the \"bad (but more intuitive) way\" lets you understand the inner workings of the box model from the ground up in an organic way. and when you advance there's always that eureka moment when you realize why other devs do this instead of that.",

Thanks in advance for helping make this project special!\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5y2edhqtvzd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa5e76744bc37cee403ea49d7c6ab6db1ad6866\n\n",

All using wordpress, elementor and acf.\n\nFor example a coach company I designed the website for, I also offered a solution to their current school booking system which used to be manual entry, now it all runs through a custom form using fluent forms, fluent forms does most of the heavy lifting for this, with most of the 'design' time spent literally just researching which form provider to choose. Also developed for them is a custom coach status slideout widget on the homepage, which allows one of their employees to go into the wp-admin and use an acf options page to set the status of each coach school route. So I push these 2 elements of their website, instead of the design of their website.\n\nFor another business which is a wholesaler I provided them with an ecommerce website with over 4k products which also links their online stock with their internal product management system (Sage). I also provide them with an abundance of marketing materials after developing their ecommerce website which allows their customers to benefit from being able to sell the products they buy from the wholesaler with a large amount of product photography and other graphic design.\n\nDesign is nice, and it's nice to make nice designs, but that's all it is, it's just 'nice' it doesn't really provide a solution to a problem a business might be having.\n\nThe best design choice you can make it to be able to get your message and value proposition across to a potential client that hits your website/portfolio in under 8 seconds and a single scroll.",

In this instance, you don't need to use grid, and should be using flexbox instead as none of the children care about the positioning of their siblings.\n\nEDIT: Not even flexbox, just normal block elements with a top margin would sufice.

        "selftext": "I have the following form on a website I'm building. I've tried a few different approaches/designs but I can't seem to find anything clean that fits. This is a pretty high res screenshot - in reality you'd scroll the page.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions/examples they think could work? I've had a look at a wizard approach, but it always felt like a lot of steps.\n\nHappy to DM a link to the hosted version. It's not ready, hence I don't want to publicise it in the post.\n\n**Some context**\n\nThe app is for creating shared tasks with other people. Someone creates the task, invites others and the appropriate people are notified when it's their turn to complete the task.\n\nAnyone can create tasks for free. Users who haven't signed up can access and fill out this creation page. This is the only thing they need to fill out. They are required to create an account when they click the save button if they want to continue. It's imperative this page is clean/exciting as intimidated users are much less likely to fill it out and will bail.\n\nOnce a user creates a task, I imagine they would have little or no interaction with this page again, unless they wanted to create more tasks. Editing would be infrequent (this form is also used to edit).\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nAs you can imagine, this can appeal to a variety of different people. The common use cases I identify on my homepage are:\n\n* At home: *Who's turn is it to take out the rubbish? We know!*\n* In your sharehouse: *Toilets looking a little rough? We can help share the load.*\n* At work: *Share fridge starting to grow fur? Take turns.*\n\nIt can be used in enterprise, families, share houses, between partners. I would always expect it to be adults interacting with the product however, even if children were to receive notifications.\n\n**Devices**\n\nI've built it as a responsive app, meaning it works on mobile. As with a lot of sites, I'd expect as much, if not more traffic on mobile than on desktop. I'm also building a native mobile app that mirrors similar functionality to the website.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt2eihicehz41.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=6031f4245281163e4360b7e9c7df239fe468a445",

I worked for two small company's which allowed me to learn multiple things in the I.T services industry but I never really specialized in anything. \n\nI decided a year and a half ago to go traveling around Asia and then head to Oz where I could continue working in I.T there. During my time in traveling around in Asia I met my girlfriend and decided to stay here. Unfortunately I can't really work in I.T here due to money and not speaking the Language. As a native English speaker I can only teach English. So what ever spare time i have i put into learning web design and web development. I find my self focusing more on the design side of things as i really like the creative side of it, which I also find a little annoying due to working in I.T I feel like I should be more focused on programming. \n\nI don't really know what to do I keep making design projects in figma and create my designs using HTML CSS and JS and update my portfolio as much as I can.\n\nI have spoken to some friends who own small businesses back home and have created some websites for them for free but they have not hosted them yet, so I just have to put pictures of the projects on my portfolio. \n\nI want to keep making  projects either for myself or for clients so i can build my portfolio up, with the hope of when moving back home I have something to show to possible jobs, or being able to work for myself as a web designer or developer.\n\nI would really like some feed back on my [portfolio](https://dthdesign.github.io/). Any advice on what to focus on or which direction to go in my current circumstance.\n\nThank you",

It's also a good place to put contact data for potential partners that may be interested in working with you, or when you want to expand your business, to put job ads up. Last but not least, you can also use a website to promote and sell merch.\n\nSo I would say you don't need to have a super complex website, but it's always useful to have one that can work as your business card and for people to get updates on what you're up to. You shouldn't get a website just to have a website, but to support and promote your main business, which is your YouTube content.",

The company I work at has a single webmaster and he will be getting close to retirement within the next 5-10 years. I will be talking with him more to get a general idea of what his daily tasks are and whatnot. I was just wondering as someone who has been kinda out of the field/casually in the field in the past, if there is anything I should know about the field as of today. How much has things changed in the 5+ years I’ve been out of it?\n\nI know how to code already and I know the basics of OOP and data structures. I’m not good at it but I can parse code pretty well. I know I want to learn more about servers and configuring them because I had a bad experience with a DHCP server and I want to get my confidence back.\n\nWhen I think about the tech field around the time I was freelancing we didn’t have ai or any of that. Ai was called machine learning and it was still up and coming. The hip new kid on the block was virtualization and this crazy idea called block chain technology. It makes me feel old and it really hasn’t been that long ago.",

We don't use any CSS libraries, and I have structured our team on using our design system, thinking about scoped components, and how all of those pieces can work together to create an app free of global controllers like a CSS lib, or a reset. I would definitely put some time into learning where the industry has gone since Bootstrap was meta.\n\nI am genuinely surprised to see so many people ITT tell you to be content with Bootstrap. I would tell you and anyone else the exact opposite.",

I moved off of Bootstrap to Foundation a while back because Foundation just overall seemed better (better SASS support, better-designed components, etc.). The thing I liked most about a framework was a column system.

(I haven't used jQuery or its friends in years and I refuse to add it to any new project.) I hear a lot about Tailwind but I haven't really felt the need to try it.\n\nBut overall, CSS framework usage seems to be a lot more fractured than back in the day when everything was Bootstrap. If your site looks good, works well, and uses modern best practices (e.g. mobile-first design and no HTML4 or table-based layouts lol), then I'm not sure why anybody would care what framework you're using.\n\nimo frontend frameworks are a dime a dozen and are relatively simple to learn. It might be helpful to play with some of the newer ones depending what jobs you're applying for, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having a portfolio in an old framework",

I don't need to be a senior/manager to live comfortably. I go in they tell me what they want it too look like I make it happen. I go home. \n\nI would spend hours designing sims, houses, PPTS, Pinterest boards, backgrounds, etc I don't mind things like that.\n\nI'm just worried it might be too late? I have no clue where to start. I owe 65k in student loans, already have my masters so going back to school isn't a great option. I wanted to be settled in my career and making a living salary by the time im 30 but its looking unlikely \n\nI'd also like to ask how much you design, or if I'm reading the job title to literally. I'm thinking web design but you don't actually do it much. \n\nI plan on getting some books, taking free online courses, and making my own websites for fun before I start applying for jobs. \n\nBut I'd appreciate any and all advice or suggestions.

You’ll be a junior so salary will be low to start.\n\nDesign and development tend to be separate disciplines, especially in agency work. It might be an idea to choose a path as there’ll be more job options. However having knowledge of either is highly recommended.\n\nI currently work in a sort of hybrid role (full stack dev and UX/UI designer) in house for an e-commerce company so still totally viable career path but less opportunities. If you worked for yourself solo making sites for clients then you’ll need knowledge of both, obviously.\n\nIn terms of learning either discipline it depends how you learn best. There’s free online courses, or paid, but they’ll be split into discipline so don’t expect design modules in a dev course, visa versa. Personally i was never someone who could learn in a structured environment and just taught myself by making stuff so thats a option 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nBest of luck to you!",

Yes there are complex websites out there, but many I encounter are fairly simple.\n\nHow much longer until you can enter a prompt like  -  “make me a website similar to oracle.com, but make the color scheme blue and white, and put the menu on the right side instead of the left, and add link on the menu to a page called solutions, and make the logo in the top of the middle of the page and when you scroll down the logo fades away gradually, etc.”\n\nThen it’ll give you all of the code.\n\nI mean if it’s already doing very complex things like making video with humans showing expressions and realistic or magical lifelike environments, then how much longer before it does something as simple as making a website that looks like McKinsey.com? And then a digital agency won’t make like $100k or whatever they would charge McKinsey to design and develop the website.\n\n**edit** for all the angry people - change is consistent in life. If you can’t adapt to change you’ll always be angry and frustrated.\n\nLike why do kids use their darn phones so much?? Back in my day we talked to each other!! Why are there so many pronouns and genders?? Back in my day there was just male and female!! Why did robots displace assembly line workers?? Back in my day the assembly line workers had good stable jobs!! Why are American companies outsourcing labor to India, China, Mexico, etc.?? Back in my day everything was done in America and all Americans had good jobs and they did a good job unlike this cheap Chinese stuff or these terrible Indian call centers and programmers!! Why isn’t America great anymore?? We need to make America great again like it was when I was younger!!\n\nI wish I had bought apple/microsoft/google/amazon/meta/nvidia stock when it was $1… Nobody told me that they would become so valuable and big companies. I thought computers and the internet was just dumb hype!! I never thought they would make so many jobs obsolete and have everyone rely on them all day everyday!",

Remember Watson or any of the older AIs? This new generative AI/LLMs fails pretty miserably compared to them except in generating things that at least kinda look right to humans. It's kinda more of an \"it's not what you said but how you said it\" sort of thing. These new and over-hyped AIs are actually pretty terrible when it comes to truth, correctness, dealing with complex requirements, etc. The common but very effective example of their extreme limitations is to just ask one of them to create a pure color image (every pixel just the same color). They can't. \n\nWant to put your AI of choice up against Watson and see which you trust when it comes to medical things? Or can it beat any of the many that excel at games like Chess and even Go? Predicting weather? \n\nEveryone is so amazed by LLMs and everything just because it's better at the language part, and I'm sure almost everyone is ignoring the domain-specific but amazing things that came before that all this hyped up stuff can't even remotely compete with. \n\nAlso, the rate of advancement is *not* consistent. It has this far been surprising, but most experts (at least those not obligated to promote something) are very skeptical and highlighting diminishing returns. \n\nAnd... The companies pouring billions of dollars into AI. And what do we get out of it? Buggier code, less efficient development, and search results telling people to eat rocks and put glue in their pizza sauce. They're dumping money in for the marketing and hype, not for the results.",

TLDR - do super animated, WebGL websites like below actually convert users?\n\n[https://organimo.com/](https://organimo.com/)\n\n[https://stonestyle.co.th/](https://stonestyle.co.th/)\n\n[https://casadisolare.com/](https://casadisolare.com/)\n\nOn Awwwards, I'll often see this type of site as a previous Site Of The Day, but then when I visit, the client will have changed it back to a static version. Makes me wonder if the user conversion numbers fall and they revert. I can guess that these sites aren't SEO friendly or accessible.\n\nWhy I ask - I'm a full stack dev learning ThreeJS and Blender, wanting to get into Creative Development for better job satisfaction (I'm loving it so far!). I'm trying to pin down the use case for these types of sites. The above 3 are highly animated, but I've seen many where there's a subtle animation within a more \"traditional\" design:\n\n[https://resend.com/](https://resend.com/) (3D interactable cube on desktop)\n\n[https://www.makersfund.com/](https://www.makersfund.com/)\n\nAlternatively, I could see a more \"immersive\" design making sense for things like newsletters, presentations, etc that don't require user conversion, like these:\n\n[https://contra.com/freelance-industry-report-2021/](https://contra.com/freelance-industry-report-2021/)\n\n[https://www.pola.co.jp/special/o/wecaremore/mothersday/](https://www.pola.co.jp/special/o/wecaremore/mothersday/)\n\nI've tried to not include websites of creative devs/agencies, as I understand the purpose there.\n\nAs much as I enjoy learning this, I don't want to kid myself into believing there's a relevant job at the end of it if there's no actual demand. So just want to hear the thoughts of actual designers on these types of sites, since I'm just a silly dev person. What you think works, who would actually benefit from having a partly/fully animated site, any insight really. Thanks y'all! - Lev  \nEDIT: spelling + clarity",

However, for people who prefer traditional username password logins, you would need to create your own system from the bottom up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Create a listing for an item by selecting multiple categories (Ie. Armor > Cloth > Padded Armor)\n\nYou would probably need a database of all the possible items, categorized by the names you have above. This data would have to be displayed to the user with user inputs, in a user interface you would have to code.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Manually input the attributes (stats) on the item they want for sale\n\nInclude user input fields and save the stat attributes in an item data object, together with the item categories from the previous point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Set a Price in relevant in-game currency\n\nThis would be a part of the previous two points, also use an input field and save this price to a data object representing the entire item (overall including identifier, stats, price).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, you would need to continually add items that are listed by users into your database, and at the same time display all items in this database to all users on your app.\n\nI've only covered the surface of each of the points above, and there's so much more detail / things you would have to consider that I didn't cover. That being said, if this is something you're very dedicated about and are willing to learn it, it's very much possible. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify or expand any of the above.\n\nEdit: also this is more of a r/webdev question, and less design related (I'd imagine you could build this with minimal design and it can still be highly functional)",

I do however have a great foundation of knowledge and more importantly experience in researching information and troubleshooting issues related to design and build. I have continued programming other various systems and languages over the years, just nothing that is related to website building. \n\nIt has still taken me several years to go through the motions of setting up a word press, learning how to fully optimize it, learning how to work out bugs and functionality issues, learning how to make it more accessible across various platforms. \n\nSo the answer is you can definitely do it. Be prepared to pour in at least several hours per day for weeks and months in end to get anywhere close to a rough product. If you want to pay for it, be prepared to get into the thousands. If not, the tens of thousands.",

You could do it in WP and it wouldn't be that hard - but you'd need WP skills. Pretty good ones.\n\n2. If you did, you could do it in about 5 days. It's not a \"team of developers\" and it isn't \"a months work for a senior dev\". Or DevOps. If it is, you're working with the wrong senior dev...\n\n3. There's literally no reason to do this from scratch, that'd be insane, particularly if you're wanting to get something to MVP without spending a bunch of cash. WordPress can do all you need. Login. Register. Listing. Custom taxonomies. Custom fields. SSO with a plugin. There's zero reason to reinvent these wheels - just do it in WordPress. If (and you may not) you need to scale in the future then you could rebuild from scratch, but don't assume you'll need scale right from the off, because you won't. Hosting fees won't be an issue until you hit massive numbers and at that stage you'll have a service worth investing in.\n\n4. If you're sufficiently motivated and happy to make lots of mistakes, you could probably do it. ACF. A flexible (child) theme. A couple of plugins. \n\n5. Good luck 🤙",

        "author": "zacholas321",
        "id": "wgqewc",
        "selftext": ">*“I’m charging twice as much per hour as I did at my pre-freelancing job and I’m working all the time. How TF am I bringing home* ***so little*** *per month?”*\n\nIf you’ve ever had a thought like this, you may benefit from optimizing for your effective hourly rate.\n\nMy goal with this post is to give you a framework for…\n\n1. Understanding what effective hourly rate *is* and why it matters\n2. Determining your **current** effective hourly rate\n3. Setting good goals & making better business decisions moving forward based on this lens for looking at how you get paid\n\n## What is effective hourly rate?\n\nIn case you haven’t heard the term before, “effective hourly rate” essentially means…\n\n>How much you *actually* make per hour ***after*** factoring in all the crap you have to do as a freelancer but don’t get directly paid for.  \n**= EFFECTIVE HOURLY RATE**\n\nCrap like…\n\n* Replying to a million Upwork posts to get one client\n* Sending invoices\n* Chasing clients to get paid\n* Doing prospecting calls\n* Prepping your stuff for taxes\n* Replying to emails\n* Leveling up your skills to stay relevant in the marketplace\n* Working on internal processes & systems for your business\n* Working on your website / portfolio\n* Managing staff\n* Copying files to that new computer you just bought\n\n## BIG-ASS DISCLAIMER\n\nThe “optimization steps” I recommend at the end of this post are what I’d consider more of a “late-stage, cushy life freelancer technique.”\n\nThat is to say, most of us start our freelancing careers perpetually broke and stuck in the cycle of always needing the next client, just to get the bills paid.\n\nIf this is you, I get it. I’ve been there.\n\nIt takes a long time to break out of that.\n\nAnd it f\\*cking sucks when you feel like you’re stuck there.\n\nBut if you stick with this freelancing thing long enough, always aiming to produce your best possible work, and trying to improve your skills with each new project…\n\nYou **will** break out of the cycle eventually.\n\nBut for today, that doesn’t change the fact that you’re stuck in it *right now*.\n\nSo when I talk in a bit about “optimization steps,” turning away certain types of work, etc. please remember to contextualize it for your situation and make the best decision for your current stage of business.\n\nMaybe you really *can’t afford* to turn away ***any*** business right now, regardless of how shitty the effective hourly rate is for it.\n\nIf that’s the case, no worries.\n\nKnowing where your time’s going and what work is most/least valuable will still helpful data for you to have.\n\nAccept that this is where you’re at *for now*, and perhaps put it on your mental list to kill that shitty low-effective-hourly-rate work as soon as you can afford to do so.\n\n## When effective hourly rate matters\n\nFor newbie freelancers / currently-employed peeps who see what the contractors at their company get paid, it can be easy to go like this when they see the hourly rates: 📷\n\n*(That’s meant to be a “envious eyes” emoji)*\n\nBut they don’t consider that it’s often the case that freelancers **only bill for about 1/3rd of the time their business takes them to run.**\n\nThis is why an often-recommended multiple when setting a freelance hourly rate is to **3x your job’s per-hour rate**.\n\nNone of this is ground-breaking, and I’ve seen it in about a million posts on Reddit and Quora.\n\nWhat I *really* want to talk about is…\n\n## *WHY* it matters\n\nEvery freelancer that’s ever existed wants to raise their rates.\n\nIt’s straightforward enough… More $ per hour = more $ in pocket. Sorted.\n\nBut I’d argue that it’s ***more important*** (or at least ***as*** important) to target improving your **effective** hourly rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause your life is finite, and chances are you’re doing a lot of stuff in your freelance business that you’d rather not.\n\nIf you can find optimizations that free up significant amounts of your time at little or no financial cost, you essentially get more life for free.\n\nBut optimizing for effective hourly rate can sometimes be somewhat sneaky and require more digging.\n\nLet’s look at an example.\n\nWhich of the following scenarios sounds better to you?\n\n### Scenario 1:\n\n* 12 separate projects this year, one per month\n* Each one will take \\~ 60 hours\n* Each one pays $6,000 (aka $100/hr)\n\n### Scenario 2:\n\n* 1 ongoing project contract for the whole year\n* Requires 60 hours time commitment per month\n* Pays $5,000 per month (aka $83.33/hr)\n\n### Which one’s better?\n\nWe’ll take a look SOLELY from an “effective hourly rate perspective.”\n\n*(Note that this example scenario is overly-simplistic and doesn’t factor in lifestyle preferences, working styles, etc.)*\n\nLet’s say you track all your time (exercise coming up) and any project you take on involves these “fixed time costs” for client acquisition:\n\n* 20 hours — Submitting Upwork proposals\n* 7 hours — Calls with prospective clients\n* 3 hours — Onboarding the new client, determining project scope, invoicing them, etc.\n\nThat 30 hours *has to happen* for every project, no matter the size.\n\nWhat this means is that in our “12 projects per year” example, we have a “fixed time cost” of 360 hrs/year (30 per project \\* 12 projects).\n\nWhereas the ongoing project has just the initial 30 hours.\n\nSpeaking *solely in terms of fixed time costs for client acquisition,* here’s how the total time commitment looks:\n\n### Scenario 1:\n\n* 12 separate projects this year, one per month\n* Each one will take \\~ 60 hours\n* Total gross paid for the year: $72,000 ($6k \\* 12)\n* Total time spent on the actual work over the year: 720 hrs (60 \\* 12)\n* Fixed client acquisition time costs for the year: 360 hrs (30 \\* 12)\n* **Total hours**: 1,080\n* **Effective hourly rate**: $66.67/hr\n\n### Scenario 2:\n\n* 1 ongoing project contract for the whole year\n* Requires 60 hours time commitment per month\n* Pays $60,000 per year ($5k \\* 12)\n* Total time spent on the actual work over the year: 720 hrs (60 \\* 12)\n* Fixed client acquisition time costs for the year: 30 hrs (30 \\* **1**)\n* **Total hours**: 750 hrs\n* **Effective hourly rate:** $80/hr\n\nSo even though from the outset, the first scenario appeared to pay better, when factoring in the effective hourly rate, the second scenario pays better.\n\n### Considerations & disclaimers\n\n>*“ZaCh, YoU’rE sO sTuPiD! What about if the client’s a pain and time consuming for the second project, or the multiple projects don’t take so much time to acquire, or \\[…\\]”*  \n**— UPSET READER**\n\nBefore you behead me, remember I disclaimed this was an overly-simplistic example.\n\nMy goal here isn’t to give you a guide on whether “more or less projects is better.”\n\nThat’s a whole can of worms and depends largely on what goals you’re most trying to target.\n\n(More money, more time, more freedom, less stress, etc.)\n\n## My goal here for you: A new lens for decision-making\n\nWith an eye on your effective hourly rate, you can make better decisions about what the ***true cost*** is to you to take on a project.\n\nSome examples…\n\n👉 If **every new client you work with** takes 3 unpaid hours to onboard, work with, etc., what would you need to charge for a *2-hours-worked project* to be worth it?\n\n👉 If a **certain type of work** requires 3x more un-billed communication time and only pays slightly better than a different type of work, *is it still worth pursuing?*\n\n👉 If you **really hate prospecting** and you can either burn 6 hrs per client or spend a couple hundred dollars per client acquired via paid ads linking to blog posts you wrote, which is better?\n\n👉 Finally feeling comfortable firing or charging more to that **super high-maintenance client** that takes unfair advantage of your time, after calculating how much per hour you’re actually making from their work.\n\n## Action steps:\n\nIf you want to calculate your effective hourly rate and optimize your business, here are the steps that have worked well for me…\n\n### ⏳ 1. Track ALL of your time & calculate your EHR\n\n**HOW:** You can track however you want; on paper, with a time tracking app, whatever.\n\n**HOW LONG:** Depending on your project pacing and schedule, it’s up to you how long it makes sense do this “track all your time” experiment for.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, **tracking all of your time for one month** is probably a good place to start.\n\nThe **most important thing** is that you categorize it appropriately into useful “buckets.”\n\n*(It’s going to be a bit of a pain to track all this if you’re not used to it, and it would suck if you had too few clearly-defined categories and missed out on some useful data.)*\n\nHere are some ideas; feel free to pick and choose what makes sense for your biz and add your own:\n\n* **Billable work** — Time you spend directly working on a project. I also like to sometimes break this down into subtypes to see where my hours go. (As a designer+dev, I might do “initial design,” “design revisions,” “coding,” “bug squashing,” “testing,” etc.)\n* **Prospecting – Outreach** — This would include cold email, Upwork proposals, etc.\n* **Prospecting – Sales calls** — I like to track this independently from the outreach time.\n* **Marketing** — If you do content marketing, I recommend breaking down into subtypes like writing, editing, etc.\n* **Existing client management / project management** — Talking/chatting with clients to keep projects moving along.\n* **Employee / contractor management** — All the time you spend managing your staff.\n* **Financial / Legal** — Doing your bookkeeping, etc.\n* **Administrative** — Answering random emails and whatnot. Sort of a generic catch-all.\n* **Misc** — The O.G. generic catch-all.\n\nNote that if you’re a toggl user like me, I **DO NOT** recommend using tags for these buckets, because you can’t generate pretty pie chart reports broken down by tag. (I learned this the hard way)\n\nInstead, for toggl users, I recommend that you create a new **client** for *yourself*, and then new **projects** for each of these “buckets” that belong to that client.\n\nI like to preface each of the project names with “ZS – ” (my initials) to group them and make them easier to pull up amidst all the client projects in there.\n\nExample setups of mine you can look at for reference:\n\n* [Here’s](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Toggl_EHR_Export.png) how I set up the buckets for my blog (client and project style)\n* [Here’s](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Toggl_EHR_Tags.png) how I set up the buckets for my web design freelancing (tag style; do not replicate)\n   * This was before I learned the hard way about tags — Your setup should structurally look more like [the one I did for my blog](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Toggl_EHR_Export.png) if you’re using toggl.\n\n### 📄 2. Make a list of your core values, along with work goals, likes, & dislikes\n\nDraw lines on a piece of paper to divide it into 4 quadrants. (Or print and [fill out this worksheet](https://kickassfreelancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Optimizing-Your-Business-Based-on-Where-your-Time-Goes.pdf) I made)\n\n#### QUADRANT 1: CORE VALUES\n\nWhat are the **fundamental** things you value that your goals are oriented around?\n\nThese would be zoomed-out things like freedom, comfort, security, etc.\n\n#### QUADRANT 2: GOALS\n\nSpecific long-term goals with your business.\n\nThings like scaling it to be huge, or getting paid a lot and working part time to leave more time for underwater basket weaving, etc.\n\nDetermine if it’s more important for you to make as much money as possible, or re-claim as much time & freedom as possible.\n\nIf you value time & freedom more than money, I’d challenge you to do some budgeting and reflecting on your cost of living to determine your **target annual income**.\n\n(For me personally, as an expat living in a low-cost-of-living country with no kids, I target around $60-80k for my cost of living, savings, and investment goals. My #1 priority is time freedom, so having that $60k number in mind helps me decide what client work to take on vs. skip.)\n\n#### QUADRANT 3: WORK LIKES\n\nWhat are the specific tasks you most enjoy in your day-to-day work?\n\nFor me it’s the *actual deep work* like coding new features, designing, etc.\n\n#### QUADRANT 4: WORK DISLIKES\n\nWhat are the things you’d love to never do again if it were magically possible?\n\nFor me, it’d be prospecting, sales calls, bug squashing, billing, and convincing clients that my designs don’t actually *need* to go through another round of revision. 📷\n\n### 🔧 3. Optimize\n\nOnce you’ve tracked all your time for long enough and have lots of juicy data, it’s time to review that data alongside your lists from step 2.\n\nHow much of your time is un-billable and goes toward aspects of the job you don’t like?\n\nIs there a way that you can apply some creativity to your situation to minimize how much time you spend there?\n\nAre there certain types of projects you should or shouldn’t keep taking on?\n\nCertain structures in your business setup that should be changed?\n\nGoing through this exercise repeatedly over the years has been really valuable for me and has resulted in some dramatic changes in my business structure.\n\nA few changes I’ve made / wins I’ve personally had over the years as a result of this style of optimization (maybe they’ll give you some ideas)…\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n#### NO LONGER DOING SALES CALLS\n\nYoung Zach used to spend *hooooouuuuurrrsss* on sales calls trying to convince people that…\n\n1. Websites are good things to have, in general\n2. You should have me make yours\n3. You should pay me more than a pittance to do it\n\nThese days, I only jump on the phone once someone’s already seen a price estimate via email AND expressed interest in paying the amount quoted.\n\nThis means that by the time I jump on the phone with someone, they’re already pretty dang sure they want to work with me.\n\nMy conversion rate for “sales calls” (if you can call them that) at this point is upwards of 90%.\n\nDo I lose some business by quoting my price via email?\n\nYes, I’m sure of it.\n\nBut do I loathe spending 90 minutes on a Thursday night talking to someone who doesn’t convert simply because my services are out of budget?\n\nYou betcha; I loathe the shit out of it.\n\n**Quadrant Motivations:** 4\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n#### DOWN-SCALING MY AGENCY\n\nAfter evaluating how much time I was spending on project management and staff management – two of my least favorite types of work, btw – I made the decision to scale down my agency.\n\nI chose to go from a 3-person agency grossing in the $100-200k area to a solo-freelancer earning around $60-80k.\n\nCould I have maybe made it work it eventually and grown it to a multi-million-a-year agency?\n\nSure, maybe.\n\nBut yaknow what, I really just don’t like managing people.\n\nMost of the time, it seems like if you want a $1m digital agency, you need to employ like 30 or 40 people.\n\nWhereas there are plenty of entrepreneurs who run $1m product businesses with just themselves and a couple VAs. (I’ve worked with a few of them as their designer+dev)\n\n*I’ll take that one, please!*\n\nI decided I’d rather optimize for time freedom so that I can try to grow a product business, rather than try to grow a business reliant on managing a bunch of humans, which I really don’t enjoy.\n\n**Quadrant motivations:** 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n#### TURNING AWAY MOST CLIENTS\n\nEarlier this year, I went from working with a client every few months to doing ongoing work with one client.\n\nIt was a similar move to the agency down-scaling — another tweak to minimize un-billed prospecting time and onboarding time.\n\nBy working with this one client and doing little updates for past clients every so often, I can earn my same targeted \\~$60k a year working an average of 10 or so hours a week.\n\nThe client’s happy because it’s cheaper than hiring me at my regular rates for all that time spent, and I’m happy because I don’t have to do much outside of the work itself.\n\n**Quadrant motivations:** 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n## HBU?\n\nGo forth! Track! Tweak! Come back and tell me if you spot any cool optimizations or have any successes (or challenges) raising your effective hourly rate.\n\nDo you already have experience optimizing based on your effective hourly rate? How'd it go? What did you do to improve it? Anything I missed? Think I'm full of shit? Let me know!",

I did the website for a large company that’s almost like the “BBB for financial advisors.”  \nSimilar story to the first one: whenever a new advisor wants to strike out on their own, they learn pretty quick that they need a website. Who to hire?  \n“Oh, maybe the guy who made the website for that org that I just paid thousands of dollars to to tell me how to start my advisor business.”  \n👉 The takeaway here: both of my big “lucky referral breaks” came from getting an in with figureheads that others looked to when trying to get started.  \n😭 Where it’s challenging: It’s not always effective to reach out directly.  \nIn probably, idk, like 2012, I cold-emailed a big internet marketer dude who also lived in Colorado trying to hire him as a mentor and do some website work for him pro bono to get my foot in the door.  \n… Which I managed to secure.  \nI think he actually booked me for paid work eventually too. (But it was low-paying)  \nThe problem though, is that I was always working from that starting point of “working for free” and I don’t know of a really good way to start pro-bono for someone but have them want to pay top-dollar later.  \nIn hindsight, he also wasn’t a great fit because he was really active in the social media space. Social media marketing + telling people to use leadpages = no tie-in to need a site.  \nThe commonality with my two lucky breaks was that a core part of the recommendations they gave to their followers was “get a website,” and that they came as a result of a random related connection.  \n(For the big advisor org, I was referred to them by a client who helped advisors set up sites and often subcontracted dev work to me, and she was friends with the founder)  \nMy recommendation here for idea #4 stems from this one working so well, while attempting to address the challenge of the “cold outreach pro bono” thing.  \nIf you can create thought leadership content for a big thought leader that your niche clients look to for advice, it gives you all that borrowed credibility AND a foot in the door to later approach that thought leader with a partnership deal, i.e.  \n“Hey Blogowner, seems like people are really digging that article I wrote for you. I was thinking it’d be cool for us to launch a service together where we help people set up their first sites; happy to send you a kickback of $200 for each client you refer or white label it under your brand blahblahblah”",

Because there weren't many businesses online, most of the sites were personal sites (and those that weren't likely got updated over time, so no longer show up like...that).\n\nAs part of that monetization comes design languages for different types of sites. For example, if I asked you where the navigation menu on a website is, these days most people would point to the top right then top left corners of the site. Back then, a lot of the navigation bars were on the left side of the page. There's also much more concern for people with disabilities, so much more care is taken to choose primary accent colors that help indicate interactions.\n\nThe technology has also changed *massively*. When I quit my webcomic site in the early 2000s, CSS *didn't exist yet* (talk to me about table layouts). Different browsers used different Javascript compilers. I don't know if you could have users download fonts. And your only option for transparency was gifs. These days CSS and Javascript are ubiquitous. We have Google Fonts (and similar products) that make it incredibly easy to serve that content. And if I want to create an icon (which is a HUGE are of growth in the last couple of years) you can use a png, svg, or even now just a font library.\n\nIIRC, there were also legitimately things you couldn't change about site styling. Like, you couldn't remove the thick-ass border on an iframe, or the underline from a hyperlink. I don't think you could do things change display values, there was no opacity, no filters, no transforms, no gradients, colors were hex- or keyword-only... I could prolly go on, but you get the idea; super limited options.\n\nBasically, tl;dr: these days the technology is massively better, which makes the build process significantly easier, there's also free things like Bootstrap that simplify a lot of design choices, and we've been constantly and collectively improving our design language for websites and standardizing around better best-practices.",

Plus a lot of the fonts were just pulled from Word, whereas no there's Goliath font libraries with previews like Adobe Font\n\nSo when you go to an older website like Heaven's Gate, it's bright red comic sans on top. Centered below that is some low quality logo type image. Then everything below that is a standard blue hyperlink or white text. The background is a basic repeating pattern.\n\nImagine jumping back to the 1920s after being used to the technology everyone has available today, it would be unsettling.

Styles and tastes change.  Same with clothing and hair styles.  Websites designs, even today, are pretty standard to the times.  I aother 10 years, we'll think the way websites looks today is bad/old.\n\n2) Limited bandwidth.  These days a single image on a website can be as big as all the content from 10 (typical) home pages from the early days.  Before 2005, many of your viewers would still be on very slow dialup connections.  Before 2000, basically all of them were.  Speed was often more important than visual design, especially for commercial sites that didn't want you hitting that back button before they fully loaded.\n\n3) Importance.  In the very early days of the web, websites were not seen by many businesses as super important.  This quickly changed, but it did result in the first sites for even multi-million dollar companies to be bland at best.\n\n4) Skill.  Very few people early on had much experience or skill in creating websites.\n\n5) Compatibility.  Especially in the 90's, but even up untl the last 2000s, compatibility among browers was a major issue.  The more complex you made your site, the more likely it was to not work for a certain subset of users.'  If you browsed the web back then you probably remember almost all sites said, \"This site is best viewed with <insert browser name here>\".\n\n6) CSS/Javascript.  CSS and Javascript are two technologies that really allowed website to become what they are today.  However, back in the early days these were not as advanced or as widely supported.\n\n7) Adobe flash, silverlight, java.  No further information needed.\n\nHonestly, this list could probably go on to include many more points.  However, you probably get the idea by now.\n\nSidenote:  One of the interesting things about the web is we went from simple and ugly, then to complex and almost intimidating, to now a return to simplicity but standarized.  This is largely thanks to mobile devices being the main way people consume the web.\n\nI've created many websites over the years and the ones I get the best feedback on are simple but organized websites.  I sort of laugh when businesses spend tens of thousands on websites, and sometimes millions, to make them look fancy.  People are coming for your content, not your design.  As long as the design is easy to navigate, they are happy.  Think about this, how often do you think about how a site looked after you found the content you were after?  You probably only think/care about how fast you were able to obtain that content.",

Good foundation. A bit dry in terms of the \"fun\" in the way they teach it.\n\n[Learn to Code HTML & CSS | Shay Howe](https://learn.shayhowe.com)\n\n* A lot more \"fun\" in the way this course is. Really good course for beginners and advanced stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Project Management**\n\n[Trello](http://trello.com)\n\n* Free, works well and many templates to play around with to your liking.\n\n[Asana](http://asana.com)\n\n* Free version and paid version (free is enough for me). I like the interface and due dates. I do my best to keep things simple. This works for me.\n\n[Bascamp](https://basecamp.com)\n\n* Free version and paid. Love the company! Did more than I needed it to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Payment/Invoice Systems**\n\n[Wave](https://www.waveapps.com)\n\n* Free, has invoices, recurring monthly invoices and receipt tracking. It's what I've been using the entire time.\n\n[Fresh Books](https://www.freshbooks.com)\n\n* Paid, lots of features and need to see if the cost is worth it for you. Love the founder and his outlook on business!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Work Agreement / Contracts**\n\n[HelloSign](https://www.hellosign.com)\n\n* Free version and paid version. Allows us to send pdf documents for e-signatures. Sends a professional signal.\n\n[Contract Killer](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/)\n\n* Open-source free contract template. I used this and made it my own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Value Pricing**\n\n[Breaking the Time Barrier](https://www.freshbooks.com/fbstaticprod-uploads/public-website-assets/other/Breaking-the-Time-Barrier.pdf) (book - 1 hr)\n\n* From the founder of Fresh Books. Great book on going from hourly billing to value pricing. Read it a few times. Reminder to read it again.\n\n[Pricing Design Work | Chris Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKXZ7t_RiOE) (video - 37mins)\n\n* Mindset shift to go from hourly billing to value based pricing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sales**\n\n[SPIN Selling Fieldbook](https://www.amazon.com/SPIN-Selling-Fieldbook-Practical-Exercises/dp/0070522359) (book)\n\n* Great book on sales process backed by research. Not manipulative and more based on common sense. We are not for everyone.\n\n[Fox Sales Legend Program](https://foxwebschool.com/fox-sales-legends/)\n\n* Program on sales for web designers. Brings a group of people with the same goal of improving sales together; accountability. There's probably a bunch of programs. This one works for me.\n\n[Fox Web School | YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChpLVuASr1CXYgV6Bqr5rIg/videos?view=0&sort=da&flow=grid)\n\n* Lets you in on how he does things and what works for him. This was helpful for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Education**\n\n[The Freelancers Workshop](https://thefreelancersworkshop.com)\n\n* Part of Seth Godin's Akimbo workshop. Such a game-changer for me! Helped me refine my craft and business as well as connect with a bunch of other professionals around the world. Highly recommend!\n\n[Seth Godin Startup School](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/seth-godins-startup-school/id566985370) (podcast)\n\n* \"Live recording, hear Seth as he guides thirty entrepreneurs through a workshop exploring how they can build and run their dream business.\"\n\n[Rework](https://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745) (book)\n\n* From the founders of Basecamp. Shifted how I view more things than just business; common sense in many ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, that's my brain dump for what's been working for me so far. I'd like to wrap it up by sharing that besides doing the work myself and showing up consistently. The second biggest help has been connecting with others. We don't have to do it alone. Accountability goes a long way!\n\nFYI, each link is an affiliate link. Lol, just kidding :)\n\n\\-\n\nedit: I forgot to mention two great tools recommended by friends the last couple of months that have been a pleasure to use. \n\n[You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (budgeting software)\n\n* Allowed me to have added peace of mind to know where my money was going. I have two budgets (personal and work). I used to use a self-made excel sheet, but then I found YNAB and decided to outsource it.\n\n[1Password](https://1password.com/) (password manager)\n\n* Added security and ease of use to have my passwords all in one place. Took me some time to setup, but now that it's in motion, it's easy.",

But overall, to improve it, there would be a few things I would like to note:\n\n1. **You should start with some wireframes first**, this will help you plan out everything better and save you time coding, especially when there are a lot of tools offering you images/ sketches/ text generative AI tools, templates, and the ability to export CSS code from your designs like\n\n* [Figma.com](https://Figma.com) (if you really want to dive into web design)\n* [Visily.ai](https://Visily.ai) (if you want to do some web making but don't have time to learn to design)\n* [Framer.com](https://Framer.com) (this is quite convenient as you can move forward to deploy to their hosting but you won't be able to export or inspect code tho)\n\n**Even sketching on paper/ tablet will do.**  \n\n\n1. **The visual balance**: Right now, the small & medium screen has better visual balance, from the biggest element to the smallest one is somewhat appropriate. But the larger version is just way too off.\n2. Responsive design means that you need to be able to convert your information from small (mobile) to large screens (desktop). The structure of a mobile is, almost all the time, different from a desktop one. But right now, it's not present in your design.\n\nAgain, like the top comment said, this is too early to judge and there would be a lot you can do to improve it. So, keep up the good work mate.",

A UI optimized for mice is simply different than one optimized for mobile/finger.\n\nFor one, more space is typically needed for fingers so that adjacent objects are not mis-selected. This creates too much white space that **wastes screen real-estate**, requiring more scrolling and other extra labor on the part of the user. (Some claim such spacing makes screens easer to read. I disagree, but it would take a while to describe. For one, good use of lines can delineate groupings without hogging lots of space.)\n\nAnd roll-over pop-ups and right-clicking are generally not available to finger-based. One can use cryptic icons if a mouse-rollover can describe them in English. On mobile you are SOL, and should use English instead, taking up space. (Many mobile UI's don't, sticking one with cryptic icons. I hate that! Spanks!)\n\nThere are additional mobile sacrifices I won't go into today. In general, for non-trivial apps/screens/functions, a UI optimized for mice will usually be very different from the *equivalent* optimized for mobile.

It's pretty smooth sailing for them to have you come in, make a design, and then also do all the work of tweaking it as they change their minds and finally get around to doing the copy-writing! So, no matter what you do with this client, it is a learning experience for future contracts: always have some limit to the work in the contract with a charge for more work, and demand a final outline with FPO content up front with some charge if they change it meaningfully.\n\nAs for this client: if you can stand to lose them, I'd suggest gently parting ways at the end of your contract. You can revisit the relationship after a few months and see if it can be reset with new terms, but trying to change the relationship without a break is going to cause friction with a client no matter what. If it would be tough but possible for you to lose them, change your next contract to start nudging things in your direction - add some pain (like extra charges) if they keep doing this.\n\nBut, if it's critical for you to keep them happy then you're in a tough position. You have to find some argument for them to change that is more compelling than, \"please do more work so that I am less annoyed with you, but no worries if you don't.\" If you're not willing to use the stick to get them to change, you have to find a meaningful carrot you can dangle in front of them to entice them to do what you want.",

It sounds like you're already on the right path, the fact that you're even acknowledging that content should inform the design and not the other way around. Lean into this even more. Be obsessive about the clients success. The more you are passionate about their site meeting goals, the more likely they will take getting content seriously. With all of my clients, I talk obsessively about them hitting goals, and using their website as a tool. If they don't have specific goals for their website, then it's not really worth the effort.\n\nIt sounds like you just need to do a slightly better job of selling yourself as a growth-builder more than just a web designer. A growth builder helps a business grow. A web designer \"sounds\" like they only care about aesthetics. If you market yourself as a growth solution, you have more sway to force them into your process. \n\n2.) Clients need to be lead. As another poster mentioned, creating content is HARD. If you are not a copywriter, sitting down and talking about your product, service, or business is challenging. If you can provide them with a framework or guide on what content they need, and how they need to construct it, you will have better results. It might be worthwhile to require that your clients go through the Storybrand framework (or something similar), before the website can be completed.\n\n3.) Bake content development into your process. When you are doing an initial discovery meeting with a client, include content writing as a non-negotiable step to your process. Let them know up front that you will be scheduling a meeting (or several meetings), writing down all of the pieces of content that need made, and actually producing a first draft of said content at these meetings. The content doesn't have to be FINAL... but it at least gives you a good start to design around.\n\nHope this helps! Best of luck.",

I struggle mostly with my services offered page as well as my portfolio overview & portfolio item pages. I want to see your guy's sites so maybe I could pull some inspiration from it, or if you know of any sites that just do such a good job, that would be awesome as well!\n\nThanks ahead of time guys and it really means a lot <3 \n\nJust a kid trying to grow his small web design business.",

The gaming sites back then usually had one main page that allowed for exploration or interaction with a setting that closely resembled a location within game. The websites helped foster a sense curiosity and also world building for the video game, and admittedly, as a kid, I really enjoyed going to those sites and spending hours clicking through everything.\n\nGaming sites now don't really have features like this anymore. Don't get me wrong, there are some really aesthetically looking sites, but it seems like everything has become so standardized. You go into these new gaming sites, and immediately you are hit with a big eye-catching image or video. You scroll down some more, and boom, another image. Rinse and repeat.Here are some examples   \n\n\n(I just thought of 4 random games and looked them up)  \n[Elden Ring](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring)  \n[Legend of Zelda](https://www.zelda.com/)  \n[Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net)  \n[Call of Duty](https://www.callofduty.com)  \nDoes anyone know what happened between the early 2000s to now? Like why did developers and marketers stop these interactive websites? Marketing budgets for these games are huge now, so I don't think money is an issue. Also, does anyone else feel the same way?",

        "selftext": "I'm bidding on a site for one of my wife's business clients.  We are also on friendly terms, he donates to my kids' fundraisers, just a really good guy.  He is a regular graphic design customer for me as well.  I do very few websites, and really only in situations like this where I'm trying to help an existing customer/friend out. That's the setup.\n\nHe is a small chiropractor and has his site with one of those \"Industry-Name\"+\"Websites\"+\".com\" marketing companies that use hideous templates and he feels like he's being overcharged (though he was cagey about what he's paying when I broached the subject).  Every fishing attempt at a \"projected budget\" was met with crickets.  Fair enough.\n\nAnyway, I'm trying to figure out how much the other place probably charged initially and trying to make sure I'm comfortably under that.   I want him to feel like he can come to me for everything.  Is anyone familiar with what those places charge?  From what I gather from some of their blogs, the marketing company tries to target a recurring site hosting/maintenance charge of $250/mo if that helps at all to determine the initial price.\n\nHis website consists of about 8 distinct page designs, and 28 pages total (all pages of certain types use the same layout with different content), including a blog.  All of the content is being rewritten and supplied by a third party copywriter that he hired to run the project for him, so that's less on my plate.  I'm planning to use WordPress.\n\nI did a detailed project breakdown and my initial estimate came to 54 hours total, including allowances for meetings, revisions and 20% project management time on top.\n\nIf I charge my normal design fee of $75/hour, that's $4050.  Does that seem reasonable and substantially lower than what the other place would have charged?\n\nThanks for reading my text wall.  Sorry if this seem insane, but I really don't want to send this guy looking elsewhere.  I have the sole bid at this point and I'd like to keep it that way.",

For example with the extension \"Live Server\" you can just right-click on an HTML-File in the integrated file explorer and select \"open with Live Server\", and it'll open up a browser window with your current file that will automatically be reloaded whenever you change and save a file. So you get a preview in an actual browser, complete with dev tools.\n\nOf course, VS code also has a lot of integrated or downloadable autocomplete fucntions and many other tools that make your live as a web dev much easier.\n\nFor the design part, today we often use prototyping tools like Figma, Sketch or Adobe XD which allows you to create designs for websites and apps which you can use for developing designs with customers without actually having to code the website yet, or just as a reference for yourself. I usually always make a prototype first, even for my private projects, because I find it easier with a reference instead of having to code HTML/CSS blindly.\n\nAlso a tip: If you missed out on it so far, take a look at Sass. It's basically improved CSS which compiles down to regular CSS, but it makes your projects much easier to handle and to maintain.",

While for just creating designs or references, Illustrator works perfectly fine of course, having scrollable previews with sticky elements, working hamburger-menus and links (that take you to other art boards basically) can be great to give clients a better impression of how the website will look and feel.\n\nA few features of VS Code that I use regularly:\n\nIn an HTML-File:\n\nType `!` (enter) to generate a basic HTML structure with the html, head, and body tags and the most important tags in the head.\n\nType `.classname` (enter) to create a div with that class, or add any element tag before the period to make it that element. For example, `p.myClass` will generate `<p class=\"myClass\"></p>`\n\nAuto-Format and indent files with alt+shift+F\n\nType `lorem10` (enter) to generate 10 words of placeholder text. You can use any number.\n\nThe feature that is generating these snippets is called Emmet and can do even more.\n\nIn CSS/SASS:\n\nWhen using more complex, chained selectors, hover over them to see a preview of how the HTML-structure would have to look like to apply to it.\n\nEspecially here, the auto-complete is very useful, when you start to type, it will start suggesting a list of CSS-properties. After typing a CSS property, it will start suggesting suitable values. That can save pulling up a reference quite a few times.\n\nTalking about references, hover over a CSS property to get a quick description and a link to the MDN reference.\n\nWhen defining a color, it creates a little box that shows that color. Hover over the box and you'll get a color picker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are using Sass, I can also recommend using the BEM naming scheme. BEM is nothing you download or install, it's just a guide on how to name classes to keep your sass files clean. Basically, every section of the website gets a main name, and all elements contained in it get that main name plus a suffix, and because sass can actually combine class names with the `&` operator, that keeps your files clean. I even go as far as creating separate sass files for every component/section of the website, and import all of them into one sass file. Sass will then compile all of it into one file, the one you have imported it into, while making navigation easy for you. No more having to search in a huge file, just click on the file according to the element you want to edit.\n\nIf you start a file name with an underscore, Sass won't compile it unless it is imported somewhere. So by starting all your component file names with an underscore, and then importing them into a style.scss (without an underscore), will make sure Sass will only generate one file containing all your CSS.\n\nThat's probably a lot at once, but I am actually relatively new to web development, and these are some things that my colleagues and I figured out and made our lifes just so much easier.",

Auto layout makes it a breeze to create true css layouts and to make sure things align to grids. Plugins basically give you infinite power to automate anything .\n\nXD is better with micro interactions and has more animations, but if you're a motion designer you should be using something like After Effects anyway, and Sketch is well.. dying. This might be controversial with veteran designers, because Sketch has been an industry standard for years, but imho it's not adapting fast enough. I personally know a lot of professional teams that have transitioned to Figma and they're loving it.",

I was left disappointed as I have just graduated from University and now have been able to find a salary to be able to pay for these subscriptions that I could never afford when I was younger. \n\nI was wondering if there was still a magazine / news-related domain for web design such as those that Web Designer offered e.g. reviews on latest frameworks, tutorials etc. I do read this sub-reddit regularly and while I do enjoy it tremendously, I always get a bit more satisfaction from reading a hard-copy, printed resource that I could enjoy from time to time. \n\n**Are there still printed magazines dedicated for Web Design present in 2022?**\n\n*Thanks in advance and a happy new year!*",

        "selftext": "It has been a few years now, but I am constantly in awe of how stupid the Facebook video interaction is.\n\n1. Click a video: Start Playing.\n2. Click a playing video: Embiggen.\n3. Stop a video: Hunt for one of two tiny icons.\n\nIf a click starts a video, a click should stop the video. Invisible interactions should be consistent - this magic change of behavior requires a special mental model just for Facebook. It's ridiculous and has to be one of the dumbest major features of a major brand currently in existence.\n\nLike, remember kids! After your cars keys turn on your car, you turn them back to turn on the windshield wipers, but click a button that magically appears on your dash to stop the car ... To help you, we'll play a reminder message across the radio when you turn on the car.\n\nI'm just imagining the product owner specifying this. Some engineer whips up the \"click to play\" and - like a human being who respects the Geneva Convention - implements \"click to stop\". Then there's a giant meeting with everyone in suits except for some kid in a hoodie and they decide that confusing their user base is the right move.\n\nIt has all the hallmarks of a Norman Door:\n\n1. When you \"click to play\" it literally tosses up the text \"Click to Expand\" -  as if this little reminder sitting on top of a playing video is going to be the one magical \"Pull\" label that finally works.\n2. When you \"click to stop\", it does something completely unexpected. In all the years I've been online, I have never wanted to \"click to expand\" a video. It's not even full screen. It's just unexpectedly embiggenated.\n3. You are then presented with the option of hunting for one of two small targets (a close box in the upper left or a tiny pause button) - both of which require mouse acceleration, deceleration, and hunting behavior. Play is 20 milliseconds but stop is 2000 - 4000. Surely that should raise some alarm bells somewhere?\n\nMaybe it's some sort of relic to coordinate with mobile? I don't know. \n\nThe interaction is completely broken.",

I never studied anything that has anything to do with Web Development or any creative field.\n\nAt first i started making websites for myself (Affiliate Blogs) and earned some money of it. This was about 2008. Then i started to get interested in photography and getting more creative in customizing themes with wordpress. Then a friend asked if i build websites, i said yes, not knowing if i would actually be able to. For the first website i received about 200€. At the time i was still studying, but somehow people kept coming and asking if i could make them a website, every time i didn't know if i would be able to, but was surprised by myself that i could do it, with help of the internet and youtube tutorials of course. As time passed on, people came and asked for different stuff, like can you edit this pictures, can you make this image into a vector, etc. and every time (again, not knowing if i could actually do it) i said yes and so i learned, depending on the project different programs like Adobe Indesign, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Lightroom, After Effects, Premiere Pro, etc. .\n\nWebsite requests got more complicated, shops, booking systems or multilanguage websites had to be made, so again, i got nervous but i got shit done. Every time getting a little more confident in my work i started to wonder if i could make my living with freelance work. So again, i just said yes, and everything kind of worked out. I do have enough projects, but not enough to have kids, and our dream is to have kids.\n\nMy idea is to get a part time job and still do my freelancing on the side. I'm about to start searching for  agencies, but i don't know what i could actually tell them what i do and what i am. Here are some of the things that i have done:\n\n* websites mostly based on Elementor and also Themes\n* I can edit mostly everything with html and css but struggle with php, javascript\n* create mockups for websites\n* Book layout and design (with InDesign) for one book\n* Posters for events (about 5), combination of indesign, illustrator and photoshop\n* Posters and menus for restaurants (indesign, photoshop)\n* Online Marketing (Social Media and Google), not my favorite area\n* Food, Architecture and Product Photography\n* Photo Editing for theatre work, so put the actors face in a painting or money bill, something like that\n* After Effects animations\n* some video editing with premiere pro\n\nThose are just some of the things i have done. I feel like i can do a lot of stuff but i can't do something 100% perfectly. What i enjoy most is talking to clients, listening to what they actually want and then giving them ideas, either with words or with sketches and them making the actual website/menus/posters/etc. I enjoy most of my work but i don't know how i could be someone to start working in an agency in a normal position. If someone is looking for a webdesigner, am i a webdesigner? \n\nI feel like a restaurant that offers everything from pizza to hamburger and then some asian food on the side.",

This also gives you a possibility to make early introductions with companies. It sets a different first impression when you're not asking for a job. Keep in touch and ask them if they need any help etc. That way when you do come back for a job, you're not just an applicant because you've crafted a relationship.\n\nI've run a business before so I can advise you better from that side.",

        "author": "ThisDontFeelRight__",
        "id": "f80f4r",
        "selftext": "**TL;DR AT BOTTOM**\n\nHello, I've found myself in a sticky situation and hope to find the right advice here. As a preface, I want to say that I will never work without a contract again, and this has been a learning experience thus far, but I just want this resolved so I can move on with my life.\n\nI am a freelancer and took on a gig via verbal agreement (through WhatsApp, which is our only form of communication) from an old colleague, to do packaging design for a consumable retail product. This project went smoothly, and at the time, he was at the final stages of developing his product, and only needed to buy bags for packaging.\n\nHe then paid me $800 up front (again, via verbal agreement) to create the website for this product, and things started getting sketchy, to the point of me hoping I can drop the project due to not having a contract.\n\nFirst, the timeline of the project was pushed back from the scheduled dates because of trademarking issues, and he actually paid me more to come up with the new name, which, after 2 months (and the website project pending in the meantime) passed the trademark inspection.\n\nWhen he came back to me to resume the website project (3 months past original timeline), new expectations were set on the design. This bugged me, because his new expectations were beyond my ability and not in line with the original (verbally agreed) scope.\n\nWe struggled about it, and he ended up outsourcing a developer to copy a competitor's site exactly, which would leave me the task of just inputting his own brand content/info. I was against this ethically and this should've been the first red flag, but at this point, I was happy to get some of the work off my hands and push this toward completion so I can get out of it.\n\nBut since he came back to resume the project, more red flags began popping up.\n\nAs I tried to produce the content for the website, I'd ask him questions about the product, and he would suggest using fake testimonials.\n\nWhen I asked why, he would reveal to me that the product is untested in its final form because he hasn't finished perfecting the manufacturing of it.\n\nHe hasn't ordered packaging, so we can't produce any visuals based on the product beyond my initial mockup during the packaging design project.\n\nDespite having no legal licensing of this consumable product (Department of Health, FDA, selling permits, etc.), he claims to have multiple establishments and clients ready to distribute/buy the product.\n\nWait, what? Something wasn't adding up. I have experience in retail consumable goods, and nothing here sounds right. So this guy wants to market a product that isn't even finished or legally up to code, wants me to put false promises on his website, and is guaranteeing me that I will be rewarded once the brand blows up?\n\nThis is just textbook snake oil bullshit.\n\nSo I Googled his name, and found evidence dating back to 2007 of him hopping digital industries and scamming/hacking until he gets black balled, primarily from multiple forum posts exposing his shady dealings to a whole industry's network. One forum thread even had evidence of sending violent threats to colleagues.\n\nI don't want to continue creating work for what seems like a scam product, and frankly feel abused because there has been a handful of conflict throughout the project about my ability to execute the things he wants.\n\nSo, I want to know what kid of legal action he can take against me if I just dropped this project and kept the $800, because that money is long gone. I can't ghost him, because he knows me and we are actually \"friends.\"\n\nIf there's some way I can negotiate my way out of this situation without finishing the fake content production/website design (which is supposed to be due on Monday 2/24, with a draft due by tomorrow, Sunday 2/23), any advice on what my options are would be GREATLY appreciated.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* All project terms/scopes are agreed verbally via WhatsApp, no contract\n* Guy hired me to do branding/packaging for a consumable retail product, went fine\n* Paid me $800 up front to make website\n* Timeline pushed back months, and scope of design expectations changed once resumed\n* Once I begin the project, red flags are raised about the validity/legality of the product and his promises of retail success, having people ready to buy, and having stores ready to distribute\n* Feeling abused as a contractor and sensing sketchiness, I research the client and find a history of scamming/hacking in multiple industries between 2007-2012, namely an exposé in a 6-page forum thread in his former industry that included his threats of violence to colleagues\n* Want to leave the project, but don't have $800 to refund, plus I already put in hours of work and free brand consulting\n* Need to know my options considering any legal risk\n* Cannot just ghost due to him knowing me and would rather part with an explanation",

        "selftext": "TLDR; Probably best not to worry about this question ;p\n\nSo I've been working on a kids' website for a while now, and part of my idea was to have just some fun facts & information for kids. I initially wanted to have categories where each category would be a different branch of science, however...\n\n* The branches of science are not exactly mutually exclusive (i.e. entomology is a branch of zoology)\n* Kids generally don't search Google for \"Zoology facts.\" They are much more likely to search for \"animal facts\"\n\nUp to this point I've had all of the ~~tiles~~ cards labeled with their branch of science in the larger font below and a descriptor above. But I've been considering changing it so that more recognizable fields remain as is, while the others are changed (i.e. \"chemistry\" and \"physics\" will stay the same, while \"zoology\" will become \"animals\" in the larger font--and \"zoology\" in the smaller font) so that they're more identifiable for kids and more specific. This would also impact the URLs of the pages--i.e. [site.com/zoology/elephants](https://site.com/zoology/elephants) would become [site.com/animals/elephants](https://site.com/animals/elephants) while [site.com/physics/gravity](https://site.com/physics/gravity) would stay the same.\n\nAnyway, I know I'm probably overthinking this, but I was wondering if this would be kind of a weird thing to do. #1, it kind of would imply to the kids that \"zoology\" is too complicated of a term for them, and #2 it just seems inconsistent. Also... as a #3, for some categories, like paleontology, I wouldn't be sure whether to keep it as-is or to change it. I know this is super random and a dumb, rambly question, but if anyone has any advice or suggestions I'd greatly appreciate it :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3trspb8zvgm41.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=a15686a34f1741d21b19e2468b833fe197719878",

                "body": "Well, actually I what I meant was that I was thinking of substituting \"animals\" for \"zoology,\" treating them as synonyms. Basically, the way I have it now is that each upper heading (except for the scientists one, it's kind of a hack) is a descriptor of the category, rather than one being a subcategory of the other. I decided to do this when I realized that kids might not know what fields like \"mycology\" are (the descriptor is \"mushrooms and fungi,\" but now I'm thinking that even this isn't quite accessible enough.\n\nThough, I hear what you're saying and, rats, now I'm thinking that's where I should be planning on ending up since realistically it makes the most sense overall... I don't know if I can produce the content to fill that many categories/branches at the moment, and man it took so long just to get this design knocked out. I think the problem I'm having is that I haven't clearly defined how I want the hierarchy to look--this is also a problem I'm having with the overall site structure. Ugh lots to think about now I guess haha.\n\nAnyhoo, thank you for taking the time to read my post and write such a detailed answer. Much, much appreciated :)",
