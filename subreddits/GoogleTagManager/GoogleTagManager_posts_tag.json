If so, how did you go about fixing for it.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nFor further reference, \n\n\\- It's a wordpress site and GTM's base code has been placed on the HEADER & FOOTER section.  \n\\- Measurement ID on the event tags are correct  \n",

Somewhere top middle (on top of where dataLayers etc are shown), you’ll see your GTM id, if your GA4 property loaded in as well it should be right next to it. You could click it to basically debug  GA4 and see if the event was actually sent to your GA4 property.\n\nDownloading the Google analytics debugger plugin and turning it on often fixes my GA4 debugger issues.\n\nPm me your url if you want to and I can check in a second if anything’s happening",

Thats an overhead 99% of marketing deps can’t or don’t want to handle. Sure, anyone can host properly on gcp, aws or any other infra to stitch up a reliable service but maintenance, monitoring etc. is just more that most people can’t handle. Besides: the usability of GTM is so good, it’s hard to compete. \nThese are just my assumptions why a real alternative was never developed nor used. Big orgs built their own frameworks in many cases, custom stuff located in the IT deps, piping data towards BI, circling marketing. Not the ideal route to take but a pattern I have come across quite often.\nThat being said - You‘ve got some track to cover :-) Go for it. Highly appreciated.",

        "selftext": "Hello, we are an EdTech business that has used Meta for ads for the last 5 years. We have been using the Meta Pixel directly installed on the page without any issues.\n\nWe just started working with Google Ads. I set up GTM (which I already used for Snapchat) and installed our Google Tag to trigger on initialization on all pages (tag starts with AW). I also set up the conversion linker to initialize on all pages. Finally, I set up a tag to fire when a submit button is clicked (which we already had for Snapchat) but to call Google Ads Conversion Tracking with the right conversion ID and conversion label.\n\nOn Google Ads, the conversion action says 'No recent conversions'. We just started running ads yesterday and we have indeed not received any Google based conversions, but we have had plenty from Meta and other channels. Is this normal? Do I have to wait for someone to click submit after seeing to Google ad to record a conversion?\n\nI am able to use the GTM debug tool to see that everything is firing OK. But when I open the tag assistant extension on my webpage, it says 'A tag on this page is installed incorrectly. There appears to be a problem with a Google tag or Tag Manager code snippet on this page.' even though debug woks fine.\n\nI also set up a pageview conversion action, (i.e. Page load: <URL string>) but that also says 'inactive'.",

                "body": "So I did this (4) recently.\n\nThere's a bunch of approaches, listed below. Roughly increasing complexity and cost as you go down\n\n**1) Don't use GTM, use default app.**  \nJust use the 'Google & YouTube' app (crap name). It can send a decent set of events to GA4 and Ads. Pretty inflexible, but also fine for 90% of Shopify stores. KISS. Most common by far.\n\n**2) GTM in theme + default app**  \nUsing the default (1) app. Also add GTM to theme <head> directly. Lets you biff in a few extra tags, like if you wanted to track some form success submits, or some menu interactions or something via GTM, firing the events to the GA4 tag that is inserted via default app. But you don't have a data layer so it's a pretty simple setup.\n\n**3) GTM in custom pixel (only)**  \nRemove any apps or GTM code from themes. Create custom pixel in Shopify admin. Chuck the standard GTM head code in it. Grab a template to subscribe/map the available Pixel events (page . Setup some tags to fire. Viola. There are some major limitations with this, because the Shopify Custom PIxel environment is sandboxed (runs in iframe) meaning it can't directly scrape or inject stuff like a normal GTM implementation. But you can still fire tags to a bunch of places. This sucks because you loose most GA4 data.\n\n**4) Hybrid: GTM in Shopify Custom Pixel and GTM in theme**  \nThis can be a technically challenging setup, ideally needs a dev (who understands GTM, GA4 and GAds) to setup robust custom dataLayer added to theme JS code to support GTM. It gets you the 'full' functionality of GTM on all pages except checkout. Then GTM runs inside a Shopify Custom Pixel on checkout pages. Custom pixel is set to only load GTM on checkout pages, so you don't end up with dupe GTMs and events. Works pretty well and possibly best 'free' option, but you have to know what you're doing. Suuucks to debug though because can't see tags firing properly using Tag Assistant.\n\n**5) Hybrid via App**  \nSome apps will implement (3) for you but instead of custom code in a custom pixel they create a black box 'app pixel' that is essentially the same thing, but you can't control. Costs $10-$100 a month. Can be handy if you are not techy, but want a good baseline setup easily. Can be a bit in-flexible, depends on app.\n\n**6) Skip GTM, go server-side app.**  \nSimilar to (4) but no cGTM. Instead using something like Stape (sGTM) or ProfitMetrics. Much nicer way to tie everything together into server-side events and get increased visibility. Eg Metas CAPI. Elevar and LittleData kind-of fit in here too.\n\n**7) Skip GTM. Go full CDP, server-side platform + app.**  \nRudderStack or Segment. Similar to (5) but going full CDP. They both have a helper app that also installs a Shopify Pixel. Highly flexible and somewhat future-proof. Seems like where things are heading. RudderStack cheaper, but less common. Segment more expensive, more well documented and supported.\n\n**More notes:**\n\n* **LovesData** has a decent video comparing (1) and (2)\n   * Youtube video: 5GVIrxZdlPY\n* Should go without saying that the **Checkout > Additional Scripts is depreciated**, possibly why everyone has this problem around about the same time :)\n* **LeoMeasure** has a good explainer to set up (4)\n   * YouTube tutorial: qNViSdxXq9I\n   * \\^ in that vid there are links to Github repo and Dropbox for full GTM container.\n* There will be even more approaches that fit between these options.\n* There is also custom, self hosted sGTM, not covered here.\n* Seems unfortunately common that stores are using some legacy or conflicting combination of multiple approaches. So good to recognise this and know the different setups.\n* Things have become waaay more complex than they were like 5 years ago (sadly).\n* Options 6 & 7 will help close the tracking gap, where ITP, cookie privacy, privacy modes or ad-blockers will drop 20-40% of your traffic stats when using only client SCP / GTM / GA4 / GAds\n* It's a real struggle to find this info laid out in a comprehensive way. Everyone wants to sell you something.\n* Also things keep changing, this stuff seems to get out of date every couple of months.",

These predefined events get passed from Shopify into GTM and then into GA4, which works fine for basic ecommerce tracking. However, this setup misses out on GA4’s Enhanced Measurement features such as scroll tracking, outbound clicks, video interactions, and form submissions. Capturing these still requires manual setup and more technical work.\n\nThe bigger issue is that many of GTM’s key advantages are lost within the SCP environment. Tasks like tracking form success, measuring menu interactions, or integrating tools like Hotjar become difficult or break entirely, since GTM can’t interact with the page’s DOM in the usual way. Debugging is also more painful, as Google Tag Assistant doesn't work well in this setup, making it harder to catch problems. Shopify may also alter URLs, which can break custom GTM rules. While some workarounds are possible, they usually require heavy developer involvement. In short, using GTM within a Shopify Custom Pixel often leads to broken tracking and lost data.\n\n* Technically, you can push custom events into an SCP using custom JS, then within SCP create more custom code to subscribe to them, and create a data layer push or something to GTM. But I haven't tried this seen this widely used yet. It adds yet another layer of complexity to using GTM, which again, defeats the point of using GTM in the first place.",

I have no formal training in this and have tied myself in knots trying to research how exactly to set up these systems. I'm hoping for a little guidance and clarity in my plan. \n\nPlease forgive the lack of technical knowledge!!!\n\nPlatforms I'd like to use:\n\n* **Google Ads:** for paid ads\n* **GTM:** for easier tag management\n* **Google Analytics:** for comprehensive analysis of what our clients are doing\n\n As I understand it, both GA4 and GAds can be used to track conversions, though each platform has different pros/cons. From what I've read, it seems best to use both for comparison, backup, etc. purposes though one should be wary about double counting triggers from GTM. \n\nMy plan is to:\n\n* Create two tags in **GTM,** using the same trigger for both to avoid duplicate counting\n   * One sends a key event to **GA4**\n   * One sends a conversion to **GAds**\n* **GADs** conversion should be set to primary to influence bidding strategy\n* Import **GA4** key events as conversions, but ensure they are imported as secondary\n* House all other secondary conversions as key events in **GA4** *(to track general engagement, etc.)*\n\nDoes that make sense? Am I overthinking it?\n\nAny input is appreciated, thanks so much!!",

A couple of clarifications from doing this for clients:\n\n\n\n• \\*\\*Separate event names\\*\\* – In GTM send a distinct event name to GA4 (e.g. \\`purchase\\_ga4\\`) and a separate conversion name to Google Ads (e.g. \\`purchase\\_ads\\`). That way GA4 won't double count imported conversions.\n\n\n\n• \\*\\*Primary vs secondary conversions\\*\\* – In Google Ads mark the GTM conversion as 'primary' for bidding. In GA4 keep that imported conversion as secondary; use other micro-conversions as key events for analysis.\n\n\n\n• \\*\\*Send value and currency\\*\\* – GA4 conversions imported into Ads only include revenue if you pass \\`value\\` and \\`currency\\` parameters from GTM. Without those, Ads will record a conversion but no revenue.\n\n\n\nI built \\*\\*AskGAAI\\*\\* to help non-technical teams stitch this all together. It connects GA4, Google Ads and GTM, points out where setups are missing parameters or double-counting, and explains it in plain English. We're beta testing and offering 50 free seats for feedback.

Go to your website\n2. Right-click anywhere and select \"Inspect\" (or press F12)\n3. Click the \"Console\" tab\n4. Copy and paste this entire code block below\n5.

'Yes' : 'No';\n  }\n\n  console.table(checks);\n\n  return checks.gtm_installed && checks.dataLayer_ready ?\n    '✅ GTM foundation is ready' :\n    '❌ GTM needs to be properly installed first';\n})();\n```\n\nYou should see a table showing whether GTM is installed and working. If you see the green checkmark, you're ready to proceed. If you see the red X, GTM needs to be installed first.\n\nFor your specific plan:\n1. **Yes**, create separate tags for GA4 and Google Ads conversions\n2. **Yes**, use the same trigger for both (this prevents double counting in attribution)\n3. **Set Google Ads conversions as PRIMARY** (for bidding)\n4. **Import GA4 events as SECONDARY** in Google Ads (for observation only)\n\nThe tricky part is making sure your conversion values and attribution windows align between both platforms.",

In GTM SST\n\n* configure a custom client to receive the event.\n* push a normalized event into the server-side data layer.\n* set up a Google Ads remarketing tag that listens for `remarketing_upload`.\n* map `items` and `user_data` to Google’s dynamic remarketing parameters (`ecomm_prodid`, `ecomm_pagetype`, `ecomm_totalvalue`).\n\n4. Validate\n\n* check the server-side debugger to confirm events are firing.\n* confirm in Google Ads > Audience Sources that your tag is receiving hits.\n\n5. Scaling gotchas\n\n* batch uploads, avoid pushing 10k at once.\n* make sure identifiers match what your Ads account expects.\n* watch for policy reviews if uploads don’t match actual site behavior.\n\nalternative if you don’t need SST: pipe directly into Google Ads API for Customer Match or remarketing audiences.",

Are you still sticking with GTM or migrating over to the Google & YouTube app?\n\nWe have a lot of clients who still prefer GTM and/or use Elevar or LittleData, and many are hesitant to move over since the Google & YouTube app doesn’t provide much customization. Is this going to be the new norm, or can we realistically keep everything as-is?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and best practices here.\n\n\n\nFROM GOOGLE:\n\n*To preserve your measurement and campaign performance with Google, you need to migrate your tagging to the Google & YouTube app before upgrading your Shopify ‘Thank you’ & ‘Order status’ pages. Shopify’s deadlines for upgrading these pages are as follows:*\n\n*Shopify Plus merchants have until August 28, 2025 to make these changes.*\n\n*Non-Plus merchants have until August 26, 2026 to make these changes.*\n\n*If you don’t migrate your Google tags by those deadlines, you will experience a complete loss of conversion data on your Thank you and Order status pages. This will severely affect your customer reach and the effectiveness of your campaigns & bidding strategies. Migrating your tags early allows time for Google AI to learn and optimize ad campaigns.*",

It doesn’t necessarily mean your data isn’t being received, it’s more of a “we recommend adding this for reliability” notice.\n\nSince you don’t have a base Pixel on the site and everything runs via GTM + server-side, you can ignore the manual snippet as long as your events are firing correctly and the hashed user data (emails, phone numbers) is appearing in Events Manager. To confirm, check the “Test Events” tab in Events Manager, if PageView, Purchase, or other key events show the email/hash, then the Advanced Matching is working.\n\nIf you want to remove the warning entirely, the only “manual” solution is to add the Pixel base snippet with the `fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID', { em: 'insert_email_here' });` Advanced Matching parameter, but for a GTM + CAPI setup, it’s redundant and unnecessary. The important part is that the hashed data is actually arriving server-side, which it sounds like it is.",

        "selftext": "Thanks for the help yesterday. I now have successfully got a Tag set up and it's logging events and sending it to GA. Woo!\n\nAlas, it's not quite working like I want it to work. \n\nI want to set up a way to figure out what is being clicked on. In my HTML I have set up 'clickable' elements like this exampe:\n\n    <button data-gtm=\"Apples\">Click Here</button>\n    <button data-gtm=\"Cheese\">Click Here</button>\n\nIf someone clicks on the first button, I want to send data back \"someone clicked on apples\"\n\nThe problem is that EVERY click on the site is returning \"Apples\" and I think it's due to limitations or bad syntax on my part in setting things up. \n\nIs there anything obviously wrong with the following: \n\nFor my Variable config I have this:  \n\n\n>^(variable type)  \nDOM Element  \n  \n^(Selection Method)  \nCSS Selector\n\n>^(Element Selector)   \n\\*\\[data-gtm\\]\n\n>^(attribute name)  \ndata-gtm\n\nThat looks like it should find any element on the page with an attribute of `data-gtm`  and then get the value of said attribute\n\n  \nFor my Trigger config I have this:\n\n>^(trigger type)  \nClick - All Elements  \n  \n^(Trigger fires on)  \nSome Clicks\n\n>^(Fire this trigger when an event occures and all these conditions are true:)   \n{{Click Element}} | Matches CSS selector | \\*\\[data-gtm\\]\n\n  \nAnd that looks like it should trigger a click event on any DOM element with the `data-gtm` attribute. \n\nAnd then, finally, in my Tag I have it set up to use the above Trigger as the firing trigger for the tag and uses the above Variable as the Event Name\n\nBUT...when I go into preview mode to see what it's logging, I'm finding two issues: \n\n* no matter which element I've clicked on, it only returns the attribute value of the first matching element in the DOM. In the above example, if I clicked on the second button, if I got to the 'TAGS FIRED' section and open this tag, it lists 'Apples' as the 'HITS SENT'\n* The potentially bigger issue is that only a few click event are returned. It took me a while to figure out what was going on and I think the issue is that most of the dom elements on our site set up to be clickable are initially set up as `display: none` \n\nI don't understand the first issue but hope it's something obvious in my settings?\n\nThe second problem...does my theory sound correct? GTM won't 'attach' itself to DOM objects that, well, aren't in the DOM yet? Any clever ways around that? \n\nWorst case, I'll have to update my code and let everything render to the DOM, give GTM time to attach it's eventlisteners to everything, and THEN hide them. But I want to try to fix the first issue before I go that route. ",

Either use a built in click variable or grab it using JavaScript at the time of click.\n\nThe second issue is related but suggest you don't add all elements then hide them as you will annoy the user and probably start getting issues with lighthouse related metrics (CLS, LCP etc).\n\nObviously solving 1 probably semi negates 2 but if for some reason you need to solve it you might want to look at using a datalayer push as the (not ideal but feasible) solution.

The site is built on **Wix**, so I’m wondering if there’s something specific with Wix that could block conversions or interfere with GTM.\n\nWhat else should I check or test to make sure tracking works correctly? Has anyone dealt with **Wix + GTM + Google Ads conversions** and knows any common pitfalls or tips?",

I tried inspecting and it does show while Inspecting with f12. \n\nMeanwhile I am maintaining my current tracking in Google shopify native app for as long I am capable to check if all works correctly. \n(this is because I get many errors lately and lost conversion) \n\nI also setup a backup Google ads purchase custom pixel as a backup. \n\nMy plan was to remove what was not working over time in order to avoid disrupting my PMAX campaigns \n(error that I already did in the past) \n\nThe problem is that my container of the gtm it shows a warning on the quality of the container (urgent) so I guess it is not normal? \nSaying that the tag is placed too much on the bottom (but it is placed by custom pixel) \n\nAnyone that could help? \n\nThank you very much in advance! \n\n",

While it’s still possible to connect GTM through a sandbox, it requires quite a bit of configuration.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. For lead-based businesses, you can simply paste the GTM code into the `theme.liquid` file under the `<head>` section.\n2. For eCommerce sites, the setup is more complex. In this case, there are multiple ways, but I recommend watching the **Stape Server GTM tutorial** for proper guidance.

Enforce CSP with nonces and SRI hashes, mirror third-party scripts locally when possible, and add a 2–3s timeout and failure fallback. Do releases via tags/branches so marketing can stage > prod without devs, and add a tiny debug overlay that lists which tags fired and why. For ad platforms, push more to server-side: send events from the site to your backend and use Facebook CAPI/Google EC/TikTok API instead of client tags.\n\nI’ve used RudderStack for routing and Snowplow for event collection, and paired that with DreamFactory to expose quick REST endpoints for consent lookups and ID mapping for server-side conversions.\n\nIf you want a near drop-in, sGTM or Stape helps, but a lean Git-based loader is the cleanest truly self-hosted option.",

GA4 was entirely reliant on GTM to receive data. \n\n  \nAs of June 10th, Shopify made some privacy changes, which I understand has compromised GTM's ability to integrate into Shopify thoroughly and also obliterated my set-up, which no longer works. My GA4 account flatlined. I found some [solutions](https://www.analyticsmania.com/post/install-google-tag-manager-and-ga4-on-shopify/), but they are lacking in thoroughness. For instance, in the linked solution, engagement data isn't passed from GTM to GA4. \n\nThus my question is have you been able to create a seamless GTM > Shopify set up in light of the new policy changes? A set-up that integrates with Shopify customer event pixels and consent mode? The new sandboxed environment at checkout has really fucked up my tracking. \n\nAt this point, it seems easier just to install the Google App. I haven't been able to find any definitive solutions online, only partial band-aids for the time being.

After a **single click on the homepage,** this number increases to **40 containers**. This behavior repeats with **every click** on the site.\n\nAdditionally, with every click, **5 new containers** related to cookies are triggered, specifically for the following categories:\n\n* preference\n* statistics\n* marketing\n* update\n\nHere’s some context about our setup:\n\n* CMS: WordPress\n* Plugins used: **Cookiebot**, **PixelYourSite Pro**, **GTM4WP** – by Thomas Geiger\n\nWe receive over a million visitors annually, so I’m concerned this could seriously affect website performance.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar behavior?\n\nCould this be a plugin conflict or a misconfiguration?\n\nAny tips on how to debug or reduce the number of loaded containers would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

I know that many out of the box tools already store this kind of information, but my customer's website agency use their own custom-made cookie banner which works just as well - they just don't store the total number of users. My question is if there is a **legal, GDPR-compliant** way to analyse their traffic? I was thinking along the lines of using a custom parameter that stores the value of the \"analytics\\_storage\" Consent Mode Variable and passes it on to Google Analytics, but I'm not sure if this would be compliant with the GDPR since I'm not allowed to track users that don't consent. Can I even use Consent Mode Variables this way? Or do any of you know a better solution, that's not switching to a different Cookie Banner?\n\nThanks in advance for your answers!",

Fire a first-party call to your own endpoint (or log on the server) that increments an aggregated counter (opt-in / opt-out), with no IDs, no IP storage, no cookies. \n\n& Yes. The cookie solutions should ideally do this, not you ;) \n\nOther solution: go for a second consent free analytics tool like plausible / simple analytics and have a look at the difference between GA and those.",

Firstly, just because GTM preview mode says that a tag is triggered doesn't mean that the actual underlying code fired correctly or was without mistakes, & certainly not that it was successfully received by Google Ads or another vendor that you're trying to send data to.\n\nIf GTM says that a tag has fired, the only thing this says decisively is that the rule that was set as the trigger was met. So if I have a piece of code that says for example that it is going to retrieve the users authentication status on a current site, but I don't write it correctly and it has bugs in it, GTM will still say in preview mode that it did fire even if it never does its intended action. It sounds more likely that there's just a misconfiguration.\n\nHappy to discuss it more with you in depth",

        "author": "Ordinary_Creme8718",
        "id": "1ncnveq",
        "selftext": "Hey guys,\nI’m trying to get server-side tracking working on my Shopify store with GTM and Stape, but I keep hitting the same problem. The GTM Web container fires GA4 events correctly, sends them to my server container, and the ecommerce data (items, value, currency) is all there in the preview. My Google Ads tags for AddToCart, Purchase and BeginCheckout are set up with the right Conversion ID and Label. So far so good.\n\nThe issue is that in the server container preview, the Google Ads AddToCart event always shows as “Failed.” In all the tutorials I’ve watched, people see “Successful” in the preview, but mine never works. When I look at the event payload, my custom_fpgclaw value is not a real GCLID but just a fake placeholder (something like fake123…). Even when I test this by clicking on my own live Google Ads campaigns with a real ?gclid parameter in the URL, the server-side AddToCart still fails. In Google Ads itself, the AddToCart conversion has stayed “Inactive” since I set it up.\n\nI’ve already checked the obvious things: Conversion ID and Label in Google Ads are definitely correct, the ecommerce parameters are being passed through, and the AddToCart action is set as a primary conversion in Ads. The connection between GA4 and the server container also works fine. I even tested with real clicks, but the problem persists.\n\nWhat I suspect is that Shopify’s built-in EU cookie banner is the real issue. It sets ads_storage=denied until the user accepts, which means the _fpgclaw cookie never gets a proper GCLID and only writes a fake one. Because Enhanced Conversions are not enabled for AddToCart in my Ads account, Google ends up rejecting the event entirely. So basically, in EU setups you won’t see “Successful” in the server preview like in US-based tutorials unless Enhanced Conversions or a proper Consent bridge is configured.\n\nHas anyone here managed to get AddToCart server-side conversions working with Shopify and GTM in an EU setup with Consent Mode? Did enabling Enhanced Conversions for AddToCart fix the “Failed” status in preview, or did you have to explicitly bridge Shopify’s cookie banner into GTM Consent Mode for it to work?",

                "body": "Yeah, what you’re seeing is actually pretty common with Shopify + GTM server-side in the EU. The reason tutorials look “clean” is because they’re usually recorded in US setups where ads\\_storage isn’t blocked by default. In your case, Shopify’s native consent banner fires before GTM can touch anything, so your \\_fpgclaw never gets a real GCLID → Google Ads sees “fake123” and just drops the event.\n\nTwo things people usually do to fix it:\n\n1. **Bridge consent properly** → You need GTM’s Consent Mode to reflect Shopify’s banner state. Right now GTM thinks ads\\_storage is denied, so it never writes the GCLID cookie. Passing the Shopify consent state into GTM fixes that.\n2. **Enhanced Conversions** → Enabling Enhanced Conversions for AddToCart (and Purchase) helps because Google can fall back to hashed user data when the GCLID is missing. Without it, those AddToCarts will keep failing.\n\nSo, no, you won’t get “Successful” in server preview until either (a) consent mode is wired up correctly or (b) you give Google a fallback via EC. That’s why your setup looks broken even though everything else is correct.\n\nIf you’re testing with real traffic + consent accepted, but it *still* fails, double-check your Stape settings for forwarding the `gclid` → `fpgclaw` mapping. Sometimes it’s just the forwarding template not being enabled.",

Then the subdomain server passes on the tracking information to meta / google.\n\nIt would be good if a solution could run on shared hosting. I understand it can be resource intensive, maybe even limited with the current php extensions, but basic tracking of events such as tel, mailto clicks and thank-you pages, and basic purchase events would only be set up as shared hosting compromise to keep resource usage low.

This is because evaluation of built-in consent only happens once a tag actually fires, and if a tag fires it will be marked as \"already fired\".\n\nThis means that if DOMReady fires your once-per-page tag but built-in consent prevents it from running, that tag will not be re-evaluated on subsequent triggers.\n\n\n\nIn any case, you mentioned that the problem is strictly isolated to iOS devices so it could be related to ITP. Although, in that case I would expect attribution loss more than missing event properties.\n\n\nI'd be curious to know as it wasn't very clear, are you also sending events to Meta from the sGTM container?

I tackled a similar issue with the Meta CAPI where the `value` parameter was being passed as a string instead of number. The tag fired, all values were present in preview and a request was sent to Facebook servers. So I was scratching my head for a while until I realized the response from the facebook request returned a status of 400 (bad request). The response payload included an error message that explicitly explained what was wrong with the request. It was an easy fix after that.\n\n\nBy the way, usually when looking at failed events in the Meta Events Manager, it will state which source sent the incorrect event, i.e. browser or server. Have you had a look at that?",

The goal is to send the net value (value minus shipping) to GA4, which is a common practice to ensure revenue reports are accurate and don't include delivery costs.\n\nTo achieve this, I used a user-defined variable(Math) in my sGTM container. This variable takes the value parameter and subtracts the shipping parameter to calculate final value which later is send to GA4.\n\nI performed multiple tests, and everything looked correct. The value parameter in my GA4 debug view and network requests showed the net value as expected.\n\nHowever, after about a month, I noticed a significant issue in my GA4 reports: multiple transactions have a revenue of $0, even though they still have a tax and shipping cost associated with them. This is happening for a small percentage of transactions, but it's a critical data integrity problem.\n\nI'm now performing the net value calculation directly on the web client before sending the data to the sGTM container. I'm wondering if anyone has experienced a similar issue with data transformations or user-defined variables in server-side GTM. Should I be more careful with user-defined variables or transformations in the future? Any insights on transformations or custom variables will be useful.",

Open your server container in preview mode\n2. Trigger a transaction that shows $0 revenue in GA4\n3. In the server preview, click on the GA4 event\n4. Copy and paste this into the preview console\n\n```javascript\n// Debug sGTM Math variable calculation\n(() => {\n  \n// Check the variables being used in your Math calculation\n  \nconst\n checks = {\n    original_value: 'Check Event Data > value parameter',\n    shipping_value: 'Check Event Data > shipping parameter',\n    calculated_result: 'Check your Math variable output',\n    data_types: 'Verify both values are numbers, not strings'\n  };\n\n  console.log('🔍 sGTM Math Variable Diagnostic:');\n  console.table(checks);\n\n  \n// Common edge cases that cause Math failures:\n  console.log('Common Math variable failures:');\n  console.log('• Shipping value is null/undefined');\n  console.log('• Values are strings instead of numbers');\n  console.log('• Decimal precision issues');\n  console.log('• Currency formatting corruption');\n\n  \nreturn\n 'Check Math variable output vs input values';\n})();\n```\n\nThis will help you see exactly where the Math calculation breaks down in your server container.\n\nThe \"small percentage affected\" pattern typically indicates edge cases where:\n1. **Missing shipping data** - Some transactions have null/undefined shipping values\n2. **Data type mismatches** - Values passed as strings instead of numbers\n3. **Currency formatting** - Decimal precision issues in the calculation\n\nServer-side transformations require careful null/undefined handling that's different from client-side JavaScript.\n\nAre you seeing consistent patterns in which transactions get corrupted (specific payment methods, shipping options, etc.), or does it seem random?",

        "selftext": "Site has Web GTM and Server GTM. GA4 events are routed to the server via transport_url, and in sGTM I’m using the “Conversions API Tag by facebookincubator”. Server-side is healthy: GA4 purchase reaches sGTM, the CAPI tag fires, and the Graph API returns events_received: 1. In Events Manager I can see the server events as expected.\n\nThe base Pixel (via GTM) is now running on all pages and PageView is visible in the network tab and Pixel Helper. However, the Purchase event will not fire in the browser on the live site. On a test/staging domain, Purchase fires fine. On live, there’s no tr?id=...&ev=Purchase request at checkout/thank-you, even though the GA4 purchase event (with value, currency, items, transaction_id, event_id) is present and feeds the server.\n\nThings I’ve tried/checked: the Pixel Purchase tag is set to the standard “Purchase” event, uses the same event_id variable as CAPI, and is wired to the same trigger as the GA4 purchase tag. I’ve also enabled tag sequencing so the base Pixel fires before the Purchase tag. Test Event Code was used during testing and then removed. Consent tab in the tag is currently default; I’m accepting the banner during tests. The network panel shows GA4 purchase requests, but never a browser request to Facebook for Purchase.\n\nHas anyone seen this exact pattern recently? Server purchase accepted, base Pixel working, but the browser Purchase won’t fire only on the live domain. \n\nAny targeted debugging steps I’m missing would be hugely appreciated.",

Install the GTM Script: First, you need to add the Google Tag Manager script to your website's code. This is a one-time setup that allows you to manage all your tracking tags in one place.\n\n2. Add a Meta Pixel Tag: In your GTM workspace, create a new tag. You can find the Meta Pixel tag template by searching the Template Gallery.\n\n3. Configure the PageView Tag:\n• Once you've added the Meta Pixel tag, paste your Dataset ID (also known as the Pixel ID) into the appropriate field. You can find this ID in your Meta Events Manager.\n• Set the Event Type to PageView.\n• Add a trigger to this tag so it fires on All Pages. This will ensure that the Pixel tracks every page view on your site.\n\n4. Set Up Custom Events for Form Submissions:\n• To track form submissions, you'll need to create a separate tag.\n• You can choose between a Standard Event (like Lead or CompleteRegistration) or a Custom Event.\n• After selecting the event type, create a specific trigger for when a form is submitted. This could be a specific Click Trigger, Form Submission Trigger, or Custom Event Trigger depending on how your form is set up.\nIf you select a Custom Event, you must also configure it in the Meta Events Manager overview to ensure it's properly recognized and processed.\n\nI hope this helps make the process clearer!

I've updated the script to remove `JSON.parse()`.\n\n**I now need help identifying the exact structure of the** `messageData` **object that Limo Anywhere sends via** `postMessage` **on booking completion.**\n\n**What I need from you, the community:**\n\n* **Guidance on how to finish this**\n* **I**s there a better way that AI isn't telling me, seeing there is a post message leaving the widget? Could I be tracking this all wrong, and there is a much easier way of doing this? \n* I could also just make the next page from my GHL form, fill the actual Limo Anywhere page, and put trackers in that page. \n\n  \nThank you for all your help. This is my second day working on this, and I am lost. I would be happy to pay for a resolution, as I am only so tech-savvy. \n\n",

Thank you pages, while easy to do, should really be a last resort, as they can easily lead to false positives and you can't get data from the form.\n\nIf Limo Anywhere has not documented what the post message contains, then using console.log is the way to go to figure it out.\n\nDid you attempt console.log(event.data)? Seeing that it is already can object, you can also console.log(JSON.stringify(event.data)) if you are having trouble with the bare object.\n\nOnce what is available is determined, the next step is to create an object with what you need and do a dataLayer push.\n\nEg\n\nSay you console.log [event.data](http://event.data) and you see\n\n    {\n      \"id\": \"some form id\",\n      \"formName\": \"the form name\",\n      \"some other atrribute\": \"attribute\",\n      \"maybe an object with form input\": {\n        \"firstName\": \"entered first name\",\n        \"email\": \"entered email\",\n        \"etc\": \"etc\"\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nThen a starting point could be\n\n    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n    var formData = event.data;\n    \n    var dataLayerObj = {\n      'event': 'limo_form_success',\n      'form_id': formData.id,\n      \"form_name\": formData.formName\n      \"etc\": \"etc\"\n    };\n    \n    window.dataLayer.push(dataLayerObj);\n\nOnce the dataLayer is in place it can be used in GTM for GA4, ads conversion tracking, etc.\n\nFeel free to shoot me a message if need be.",

                "body": "Sorry about that. Lol. The short answer is I was trying to figure out if you saw anything using console.log.\n\nLonger answer:\n\nI was going off of what you were saying:\n\n>My postMessage listener is active, and I'm using console.log to output the event.data that Limo Anywhere sends. However, my initial attempts to JSON.parse(event.data) failed, indicating event.data is already an object (not a JSON string). I've updated the script to remove JSON.parse().\n\nMy interpretation is that you are trying to figure out what is in [event.data](http://event.data) but encountered some issues with using JSON.parse. What was not clear was if you were able to see anything using console.log after removing JSON.parse.\n\nJSON.parse takes a JSON string and turns it into a JavaScript Object. Since [event.data](http://event.data) was already a javaScript Object, it did not work.\n\nHowever, you can console.log a JavaScript Object directly, hence console.log(event.data), but it might also have a bunch of stuff that a JSON string would not have, that might make it confusing.\n\nSo turning it into a JSON string and then console.log that would make it easier in interpret. JSON.stringify does the opposite of parse and turns a Javascript object into a JSON string, hence console.log(JSON.stringify(event.data))",

It just doesn’t feel right to accept such a large difference without a clearer explanation or timeline for a fix.\n\nHas anyone else run into this? If so, how did you address it?

If there is any particular event typee that are missing\n2. Is the users/sessions similar? If so, it suggests that just some tags are missing. \n3. Don't just check the total number of events but also number of users per events. Is perhaps your client side sending duplicate events\n4.

Check that the region-specific behaviour for tags setup is done and that you are serving scripts from a first party domain. Advanced consent mode won't work without it but it's often missed particularly when trying to run client and server side together\n6. Change reporting identity in the GA4 console to observed for both (you can change back after). It's possible that your older property has enough data to start modelling but your newer property doesn't yet so one has modelled events on blended while the other does not\n\nIf you export to Bigquery (maybe enable it if the business knowledge is there to use it)\n\n7.

The key is to use something unique about your button - like its ID, class name, or even the text on it - to tell GTM \"count this specific button.\"  \n  \nBring this clicks into Google Analytics.\n\nThen try connecting hunch.dev to create data slides that tell you about click patterns. Saves tons of manual setup time.  \n  \nGood luck! Once you get the first one working, the rest will be much easier.",

        "selftext": "I'm trying to set up server side tagging via GTM for our websites, for websites with Onetrust CMP I'm seeing a 70% or higher decrease in the below events in ga4 server side, vs client side.\n\n* session start\n* first\\_visit\n* page\\_view\n* user\\_engagement\n\n  \nWe're not using the OneTrust CMP template to set the defaults, the code is added directly to the sites. In the server side preview I'm seeing it take 20+ minutes to populate the Outgoing HTTP Requests from Server - before the its None and after its 'Unknown' (when gcs is 101). If all cookies accepted and gcs is 111 outgoing http requests from server is Post - 204.\n\nI have checked our set up against this article: [https://my.onetrust.com/s/article/UUID-d81787f6-685c-2262-36c3-5f1f3369e2a7](https://my.onetrust.com/s/article/UUID-d81787f6-685c-2262-36c3-5f1f3369e2a7) and it matches, testing shows dataLayer updates are correct too. \n\nIn the client side preview I'm seeing the dma\\_cps parameter is - but the gcs parameter (which also indicates consent) is g101 (analytics accepted only in this instance), I think this conflict is part of the problem.\n\nI've tried consent granted specific triggers in the server side, I'm using a OneTrustGroupsUpdated trigger in the client side, source, medium etc. are being sent from the client side and session ID and client ID are also successfully sent.\n\nClient side tags are respecting cookie choice, the problem seems to be in the handover between client side and server side.\n\nHas anyone seen this before? How do I resolve it?\n\nThanks in advance.",

            {
                "body": "I use a systematic diagnostic approach for tracking issues, and your problem is a Layer 3: Transmission issue.\n\n**Layer 3** focuses on the data journey from client to server - when tags fire correctly but data fails to reach its destination. In your case, events are leaving the client but 70% never make it to GA4 through your server container. This layer specifically deals with network requests, consent handoffs, and the critical handshake between client and server containers.\n\nThe smoking gun in your description: OneTrust shows `gcs=g101` (analytics accepted) but server requests show \"Unknown\" for **20+ minutes**. This delay is the server container timing out waiting for valid consent signals that never arrive.\n\n## Diagnostic for Consent Transmission\n\nRun this to see exactly what's being sent to your server:\n\n```javascript\n// Check what consent signals are being transmitted\n(() => {\n  // Look for server container requests\n  const serverRequests = performance.getEntriesByType('resource')\n    .filter(r => r.name.includes('gtm-server') || r.name.includes('sgtm'));\n  \n  console.log('Server requests found:', serverRequests.length);\n  \n  // Check consent parameters in requests\n  serverRequests.forEach(req => {\n    const url = new URL(req.name);\n    const params = {\n      gcs: url.searchParams.get('gcs'),\n      consent: url.searchParams.get('consent'),\n      gdpr: url.searchParams.get('gdpr')\n    };\n    console.log('Request consent params:', params);\n  });\n  \n  // Check if OneTrust is sending updates\n  const consentEvents = dataLayer.filter(d => \n    d.event?.includes('consent') || \n    d.event?.includes('OneTrust')\n  );\n  \n  console.log('Consent events in dataLayer:', consentEvents.length);\n  return consentEvents;\n})();\n```\n\n## The Root Cause\n\nYour OneTrust CMP is updating consent in the browser but not forwarding it through the client-to-server transport layer. The server container receives requests but can't verify consent state, so it drops them. The article you referenced doesn't cover this specific handoff issue.\n\n## The Fix: Consent State Bridge\n\nYou need an explicit consent forwarding mechanism:\n\n### Client-Side: Capture and Forward OneTrust State\n\nAdd this as a Custom HTML tag in your CLIENT container, triggered on \"OneTrustGroupsUpdated\":\n\n```javascript\n// Add to GTM Custom HTML tag - fires on OneTrustGroupsUpdated\n(function() {\n  // Capture OneTrust consent decision\n  const consentGroups = OneTrust.GetDomainData().Groups;\n  \n  // Map to Google consent types (adjust group IDs to match your OneTrust setup)\n  const consentMap = {\n    'C0002': 'analytics_storage',  // Performance cookies\n    'C0004': 'ad_storage',         // Targeting cookies\n    'C0003': 'ad_user_data',       // User data\n    'C0004': 'ad_personalization'  // Personalization\n  };\n  \n  // Build consent state for server\n  const serverConsent = {};\n  consentGroups.forEach(group => {\n    if (consentMap[group.CustomGroupId]) {\n      serverConsent[consentMap[group.CustomGroupId]] = \n        group.Status === 'active' ? 'granted' : 'denied';\n    }\n  });\n  \n  // Push with server transmission flag\n  dataLayer.push({\n    'event': 'consent_state_sync',\n    'consent_for_server': serverConsent,\n    'timestamp': Date.now()\n  });\n  \n  console.log('Consent forwarded to server:', serverConsent);\n})();\n```\n\n### Server-Side: Receive and Apply Consent\n\nIn your SERVER container:\n1. Create a trigger for the `consent_state_sync` event\n2. Create a tag that reads `consent_for_server` and updates consent\n3. Set this tag's priority higher than your GA4 tags\n\n## Why 70% Loss?\n\n- **30% getting through**: Users who accept all cookies immediately (gcs=g111)\n- **70% lost**: Users with partial consent (gcs=g101) where the handoff fails\n\nThe 20+ minute delay is the server container timeout - it's waiting for consent confirmation that never arrives through the standard OneTrust integration.\n\n## Validation\n\nAfter implementing, you should see:\n- Server-side events matching client-side (minus bot filtering)\n- No more 20-minute delays\n- Consistent gcs parameters between client and server\n- \"Post - 204\" responses instead of \"Unknown\"\n\nThis is a known limitation of OneTrust's standard server-side documentation - they don't properly address the consent state bridge requirement for partial consent scenarios.",

        "author": "sambarnes90",

        "selftext": "Morning Everyone\n\nI wondered if anyone has tried to execute something like this in the past before I go down a long rabbit hole trying to find a solution.\n\nWe have any number of tags that are firing in our server side container to send conversion data to any number of sources - some are HTTP request tags, some are platform-provided templates, some are custom templates.\n\nWhat I'd like to try and do is capture the \"Outgoing HTTP Requests from Server \" for all of these tags and store it in BigQuery for future diagnosis of issues and analysis.\n\nMy initial thoughts were:\n\n1. Cleanup Tag: Not an option as there's no sequencing on the server-side.\n2. Catch All Client: Potentially running one \"parent\" client that uses `runContainer` and then extracts extracts the results from `onComplete.`\n\nOption 2 seems like it *could* work given the right conditions.\n\nBut I don't think there's a way access the outgoing HTTP requests from tags - given that the only callback in the `runContainer` call provides the tag metadata basically (`executionTime`, `id`, `status`), and not much else!\n\nThe other option I would guess is to do something on the logging side to capture those outgoing requests?\n\nHas anyone implemented something like this in the past or have any bright ideas about how this could be achieved?",

        "selftext": "Hi all - I have setup Google ads conversion tracking via GTM and for GA4 analytics i am using pixelyoursite plug-in for my woocommerce website. While i am seeing all revenue numbers correctly in google analytics, i have a very small marketing budget allocated to google ads where i see impression and click data but the revenue is hardcoded as Rs 1 for all sales. Now these are the pointers i have double checked so far - \n\n1. The Purchase conversion goal in google ads has “use dynamic value, if nothing is found fall back to 1”. \n\n2. I have a tag setup for Google ads - Purchase in GTM with the correct conversion ID, Conversion label. I also have data layer variables setup for purchase, currency and transaction id. \n\n3. I made a test purchase to check if these values are passed correctly to GTM in the api call and purchase data layer upon previewing. They are passing correctly. \n\nKey issue: while google ads purchase tag is being fired on the actual purchase, google ads config tag and the conversion linker tag is not getting fired on purchase (it is getting fired until begin checkout). When i check the tag details for the google ads config tag, there seems to be a filter added for “all pages” which stops it from being loaded on purchases. When i created the tag i selected the default “all pages” trigger available in the search bar which has a default filter added. Seeing this i created a new manual trigger for all pages and updated it to gtm tags but unfortunately the gtm tag stopped working beyond homepage - so reverted to the earlier setup - what do i do to get purchases to show dynamic values in google ads?

If you do, then decide to either move Analytics to GTM or move Ads to PYS. They cannot be installed using 2 different methods. It leads to issues.\n\n2. If you use a non-standard order confirmation page, then make sure that it is actually supported by PYS. Also, there is an option in PYS where you enter the URL of the custom confirmation page. Make sure your URL is there.\n\n3. If you use a consent management tool, make sure they are set up correctly and don't block anything in Gtag which loads Google Ads.\n\n4.  if that fails you can try my plugin :)",

In the GTM SS container create a new tag of type “Fetch” that fires on every event and posts the request body to a custom endpoint; mine is an /ingest path handled by an Azure Function. The Function grabs context.req.rawBody, adds a timestamp, and writes JSON to Blob with a yyyy/mm/dd folder structure. If traffic spikes, stick Event Hubs in front to buffer and let Databricks Auto Loader sweep the blobs into Delta for querying. After experimenting with plain Functions and Event Hubs, [APIWrapper.ai](http://APIWrapper.ai) ended up being the cleanest way to funnel the payload and extra headers into the same blob without extra SDK code. Bottom line: skip GA360, push GTM SS hits to your own endpoint, and drop the raw events straight into Azure Blob for long-term storage and analysis.",

        "author": "Tagnetica",
        "id": "1mgg5f3",
        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI've been working in analytics for several years now, and recently built a tool to help with my own GTM container analysis. After using it myself for a few months, I thought others might find it useful too. It's still a work in progress but I'd love to get some feedback from the community.\n\nWhat it is: GTM Super Hero (Ha ha I know a bit exaggerated probably),  a privacy-focused web app for analysing and auditing GTM containers. You can import JSON exports or connect directly via the GTM API.\n\nWhy I built it: I was tired of manually reviewing containers or sifting through GTM exports and wanted something more visual, responsive and interactive. The existing tools I knew about didn't *exactly* fit my needs.\n\n\n\nWhat makes it different:\n\n* 100% client-side analysis - Your GTM data never leaves your browser\n* Interactive network visualization - See tag-trigger-variable relationships visually\n* Advanced unused entity detection - Accounts for tag sequencing (setup/cleanup tags)\n* AI-powered regex generator - Describe patterns in plain English, get GTM-ready regex\n* Container cleanup feature - Remove unused entities directly via API\n* Feature-based pricing - Simple free vs pro feature access\n\n\n\nFree tier:\n\n* Full container analysis and visualization\n* Unused entity detection with sequencing logic\n* Global search across all entities\n* Consent audit features\n* JSON export/import\n* Interactive network graphs\n\n\n\nPro tier ($9.99/month):\n\n* All Free tier features\n* Container cleanup (remove unused entities)\n* Export to Excel\n* Bulk editing and name changes\n* Priority support\n\n\n\n**Privacy first**: Everything runs in your browser. No GTM data is ever uploaded to external servers.\n\n\n\nI've followed the likes of Julius and Simo for years and I was inspired by GTM Tools, but I deliberately didn't look at the current implementation (post Stape adoption) while building this to avoid just creating a clone. I'm happy with how it turned out - it's my own thing in it's way.\n\nThis started as a personal tool but I'm hoping it might become a small side income and at least be useful to some even if they just use the free bits. I'd really appreciate any feedback, especially on:\n\n* What current features would be most valuable to you?\n* Is the pricing reasonable?\n* What's missing that you'd want to see?\n* Other than here on reddit, whats best to get feedback & requests from users at the point of usage (eg Hotjars feedback tools)?\n\n\n\nYou can check it out at [https://gtmsuperhero.tagnetica.co.uk/](https://gtmsuperhero.tagnetica.co.uk/)\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, and I'm open to any questions or suggestions!",

That means your GTM snippet isn’t firing right away when the page loads it only runs when that function is explicitly called. Until then, your dataLayer events (like page\\_view, purchase, etc.) may be pushed into the queue but GTM isn’t initialized to pick them up.\n\nThat can cause exactly the symptoms you’re seeing:\n\n* GA4 showing up late in Tag Assistant - because the GTM container itself is injected later, not on page load.\n* Missing or inconsistent conversion data - if the GTM script loads *after* a user action (like a quick form submit, add\\_to\\_cart, or even a bounce), the event is lost since GTM wasn’t live to catch it.\n* Debug mode looks fine - because when you test, you’re forcing the script to load, so GTM eventually processes the hits but in real user flow, many hits never make it.",

GTM already has a built in event listener for form submit as well as there's a built in event for form submits (it's called generate\\_lead). \n\nWhat you have to do is link the two. You'll have to create a form submit trigger in GTM that triggers on something unique with the form. To find this, you have to go into debug mode, once there, put through a test form submit and then click on the form submit listener that pops up, and read what unique variable you can use (usually I use a click class or ID. Also you can play around with like \"only click text on this specific page\" if something like that isn't there. If THAT doesn't work, then you would maybe need your dev to associate a unique class or ID to the element.\n\nAfter that you have to make the tag and link the two. making a tag link to GA4 can be somewhat confusing, but I'll link this post here which this guy has helped me (and still helps me) figure out my analytics stuff: [https://www.analyticsmania.com/google-tag-manager-form-tracking-auto-event-listener/](https://www.analyticsmania.com/google-tag-manager-form-tracking-auto-event-listener/)",

There are tons of ways to do this, for example you could let developers implement datalayer events. As GTM doesn’t store data it is up to you to create tags, variables and triggers that read those dataLayers and send the data to GA4 for example. Next to datalayer event which a developer can implement you can also track various actions and parameters with CSS selectors for example. Cookies will contains a user and session id. So if a user visits your website a cookie is set. If he returns GA4 will read the cookie and thereby know that it is a returning user.\n\nIn a complete GTM course you will learn about all these aspects. Cookies, events, variables/parameters like the name of a button or the item that was viewed. It will learn you how to debug your setup with GTM and in the GTM debugger you will see literally every data that’s coming in and which you could use to enhance your tracking according to your needs. You’ll find a lot of automatically collected data for example which you could add to events as parameters as desired. \n\nI think learning GTM is the best way to get familiar with all aspects you’d like to learn. While you start working in GTM to set up tracking according to your compagnies goals you’ll, of course, run into a loads of questions and there is no single answer to solve them. Communication with developers about how to extract data from a website will get you more and more technical but ways of extracting data yourself with CSS selectors for example will teach you the technical sides of tracking to!\n\nThere’s extremely much to learn like server side tracking, SQL and bigQuery and much more. But knowing how data collections works is at the basis of all of this. Don’t expect, and don’t try to learn all aspects at once. Get comfortable with GTM and they you can proceed with other aspects that you’re interested in!",

You could use once per session for example, but some websites might have multiple forms with the same thank you page over and over again and if multiple are filled out by the same user you would indeed want it to fire multiple times.\n\nYour advice about keeping it simple is definitely good advice, just wanted to point out that there are still things to think about to be sure that the data is accurate. Some degree of knowledge of tag manager functionalities like settings from your example about triggering once per page / once per session / or on every specified event should be thought about while implementing more ‘general’ triggers.",

So, after getting used to normal GTM you can get into Server side and it’s not that hard to be honest.\n\nThe analytics mania course should be a very good course. Once you’re working with GTM and you’re unsure how something works so you Google it, he’s the one that’s on top of your search results with the answer to any question that you can think of! While I didn’t do it myself, I think his is probably one of the best.\n\nSimo Ahava is like te biggest legend in GTM, but currently more into server side I think. In many blogs about GTM from others you’ll see him being mentioned as the one who created/found out solutions to problem. I found a course (https://cxl.com/institute/online-course/advanced-google-tag-manager/)on CXL (maybe your company has an account as well, which would make it free) from him but I suggest you to ask them how old it is, much has changed over time, so if it’s outdated you shouldn’t use it probably. Analytics mania is up to date for sure!\n\nIn these courses they are also going to talk about basic HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Basic knowledge of this will be helpful eventually. If you have reached those topics in your GTM course and want to learn the basics of these, then check out codecsdemy, I found their html, css and JavaScript courses straight to the point and they are free to!\n\nIn conclusion. Yes, analyticsmania is an excellent choice. Simo Ahava’s course on CXL should be to if it’s not outdated so might want to mail them!",

After a bit of debugging in **GTM Preview Mode**, I found the problem:\n\n* Facebook Pixel was firing **twice** (once hard-coded in the site header, and once inside GTM).\n* Their form submission trigger was misconfigured, so not all leads were being recorded.\n* They had no clear event structure between GA4 and Facebook, so attribution was all over the place.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\n1. Removed the duplicate hard-coded pixel and standardized tracking in GTM.\n2. Set up a clean **custom event trigger** for form submissions.\n3. Linked everything to GA4 and tested with Pixel Helper + GTM Debug mode.\n\nOnce fixed, the numbers lined up across platforms, and they finally had **accurate conversion tracking**.\n\nWhat surprised me was how common this seems to be. A lot of websites I’ve checked have broken GTM setups without realizing it. It’s scary to think how much ad spend is wasted because data is misleading.\n\nHow do you usually audit GTM setups?

At Aimerce we help brands clean up these setups and the biggest shift comes once the events are standardized across GA4 and Meta and validated server-side.

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI'm using \"augment\" transformations to enrich event data in a server-side GTM container. One of those transformation computes a ReCAPTCHA score for some events.  \nThe idea is to use the result of the CAPTCHA assessment to trigger, or not, certain tags. The goal being to avoid recording conversions and data from spam traffic.  \nThe issue is that the \"captcha\\_score\" parameter I create via the augment transformation seems to be unusable in tags' trigger conditions. \n\nMy setup is like this: \n\n1. CAPTCHA Transformation adds the \"captcha\\_score\" parameter to the event\\_data\n\n2. I created a \"ReCAPTCHA Score\" event data variable that pulls the value from the \"captcha\\_score\" key in the event data object.\n\n3. I use this variable in trigger conditions by checking that it's greater than or equal to a certain value (>= 0.7 in this case).\n\nThe logic sounds fine to me, however in practice none of my tags with this condition ever fire. When I look at the value of my \"ReCAPTCHA Score\" variable, it is indeed undefined.  It's as if any event parameter added via \"augment\" transformations isn't recognized by event data variables. It's weird because when reading the docs, that's literally what transformations are for: manipulating the event data object.\n\nAm I doing something wrong here?",

I guess triggers evaluate the variables in their global context, when the client claims the request, not after transformations.\n\nMy workaround was to create a custom **tag** template instead, and use the [runContainer](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/server-side/api#runcontainer) API to \"clone\" the add\\_to\\_cart event after the Captcha score is retrieved, and add that to the event model manually.

Additionally, triggers set to fire on “Page View” might run too early before the dataLayer is ready; using “DOM Ready” or “Window Loaded” triggers usually helps. GA4 may also filter or deduplicate events due to IP exclusions, consent mode settings, or browser restrictions, which can cause missing conversions.

It's tracking everything and has an excellent rating. I have tags starting in both G and GT and both are firing/reporting back. However when I go to my Google Tag Manager, logged in with the same email address associated with my GA, I realized my view was super limited and all of the dropdowns only displayed the GA orange lines logo, and when clicked on opened a new tab in GA. I could barely navigate around at all.\n\nI realized that I wasn't seeing the \"Workspace\" | \"Versions\" |  \"Admin\" at the top of the homepage that I was seeing in some guides and how-tos. It actually kept prompting me to create an account, so I did out of the same email that I have all of my GA access with.\n\nNow I'm super confused. It's like the account doesn't recognize me at all or my GA access. Now the Recents dropdown has two options, the orange lines logo for my Google Analytics where everything is working, and now the new account with the blue diamond for GTM which seems to not be connected to anything even though they're the same email. I tried the New Tag > Google Analytics > GA4 Event, but when I paste the Measurement ID starting in G- that is currently firing on my M site, it says \"No Google tag found in this container.\" Combine with another tag isn't working either, as it says no tags found. The G and GT tags are new numbers that aren't the same as the ones I know are up and working.\n\nI've googled around a lot and can't find a clear explanation on how to connect these accounts, even though they're the same email address where I have all of the permissions. The whole reason I stumbled across this problem was my company wanted to install a new 3rd party pixel from a site called Premion. I'm happy the Google Pixel is working and all, but I could use help on linking GA and GTM together so that I'm actually seeing and managing the same tags on both sites....\n\nThank you!!!!!

Later, in Version 20, I created *Tag A*. When I restored Version 1, I expected *Tag A* to disappear. However:\n\n* In the **GTM workspace UI**, I still see *Tag A*.\n* In the **live container**, *Tag A* is not firing (as expected, since it wasn’t part of Version 1).\n\nSo it feels like the restored version didn’t fully wipe the workspace back to how it was at that point in time. Instead, it kept showing newer tags as “unpublished changes.”Is this normal GTM behavior? And what’s the cleanest way to restore a version and make edits starting from that exact baseline, without leftover tags from later versions hanging around in the workspace?",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Trying to confirm if *Browser → Server → GA4 + Meta* is the proper architecture when using GTM Server-side tagging. Right now, GA4 Event tags seem to bypass the server and go straight to GA4, with Meta picking them up via backend forwarding. I want to centralize all event routing through the server for consistency and deduplication—but I can’t find clear confirmation that this is officially supported or expected behavior. Anyone actually done this and know for sure?\n\n———\n\nI’m in the process of wiring up server-side tagging with Google Tag Manager for both GA4 and Meta (Facebook) CAPI. I’m trying to establish whether the architecture I’m aiming for is actually the “correct” best-practice approach—or if I’m overengineering something that Meta’s auto-setup intentionally avoids.\n\nHere’s what I’ve got:\n\n* GTM Web container handles tagging.\n* A **Google Tag** (not the old GA4 Config) is in place with a transport\\_url that points to my GTM Server container (custom domain mapped).\n* GA4 Event tags are firing from the Web container for things like form submissions, outbound clicks, etc.\n* Meta CAPI is installed via their GTM partner integration, which created:\n   * A server-side Meta tag\n   * A GA4 Event tag that mirrors all GA4 events\n   * A Meta Pixel tag with event\\_id configured\n\nHere’s what I’m trying to do is **Ensure that all GA4 events go Browser → Server → GA4 + Meta**, so that the server container becomes the single hub for both platforms. This would mean:\n\n* GA4 Event tags use transport\\_url to route through the server\n* event\\_id is attached browser-side for deduplication\n* Meta only receives events through the server (with deduplication support)\n\nThe problem is:\n\nGA4 Event tags don’t support transport\\_url directly. Meta’s GA4 tag bypasses the server entirely and sends data directly to GA4. The server sees these events only because GA4 forwards them from the backend (via the GA4 Client in GTM Server). This seems inconsistent and breaks event\\_id pairing for custom events.\n\nSo the question is:\n\n* Is the architecture I’m aiming for (**Browser → Server → GA4 + Meta**) actually the right way to do this when you’re using server GTM?\n* Or is Meta’s default approach (**Browser → GA4 → Server → Meta**) actually what Google/Meta expect and support for production use?\n\nBonus points if you’ve implemented this and have confirmation (from real behavior or from Google reps/devs/docs) that GA4 Event tags *are or are not* meant to route through the server when a Google Tag is present with transport\\_url.\n\nI’ve done a lot of reading and arguing with ChatGPT, and I’ve yet to see this spelled out clearly.

        "selftext": "Hey GTM wizards,\n\nTired of manually tagging every button, link, and UI element for click analytics?\n\nHere’s a free, open-source utility that **automatically tags all interactive elements** in your DOM with standardized `data-*` attributes, then captures every click and pushes structured data right to your analytics tooling Google Tag Manager (`window.dataLayer`), Tealium, RudderStack, Segment, Mixpanel, or your own endpoint.\n\n# What problem does this solve?\n\n**Manual click tracking = hours lost.**  \nEvery new campaign, A/B test, or product launch usually means endless repetitive tagging, then even more time double-checking every data attribute.\n\nThis project does it for you reliably, automatically, and at scale.\n\n# How to use with Google Tag Manager (GTM):\n\n1. **Add the script** (TypeScript library or copy-paste JS snippet from the GitHub repo) to your site, or deploy as a Custom HTML tag in GTM.\n2. **Set up a single trigger** in GTM:\n   * **Type:** Custom Event\n   * **Event name:** `click_event`\n3. **Create Data Layer Variables** for each value:\n   * `click_object.action`\n   * `click_object.context`\n   * `click_object.type`\n   * `click_object.value`\n4. **Add one new click tag** (for GA4, or your clickstream tool), attach your trigger & variables - name them as you like.\n5. **Done!** All click events across your whole site are now tracked automatically, no manual tagging required.\n\n**A few more details:**\n\n* Works out-of-the-box with `<a>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, etc.\n* Semantic data attributes are added automatically\n* Performance impact is negligible (\\~2ms overhead)\n* Fully customizable for other analytics platforms (just swap out the dataLayer push)\n\n**Want to contribute or check out the code?**\n\n* Unit tests are included (written in Jest/TypeScript).\n* If you want to add new features, more test coverage, or suggest improvements, PRs and feedback are very welcome!\n* [https://github.com/rathoreabdullah/Click-Tracking-Automation](https://github.com/rathoreabdullah/Click-Tracking-Automation)\n\nHappy to answer questions or help anyone get started. Hope this saves you a bunch of time!\n\nAbdullah",

It is agnostic of the site being Sitecore or Wordpress or AEM or a React SPA, etc. It captures the clicks, and attempts to identify the click element by id, class name, text, aria-label, data-testid, alt text, click URL, etc. It breaks down the click URL so you can leverage it for either measuring social media link clicks - click host name - or PDF downloads - click document. If, for example, your click is identified by an aria-label that is not set on the specific click element, but on the parent tag of the element, the code searches up 3 levels to identify the value. If your web developers used something other than aria-label or data-testid, etc to identify click elements, you can use this as a template. The only thing you need to change for the code to work is replace the {{GAID}} reference with the value used in your site GTM container.\n\n\n\n[https://github.com/drewspen/gtm-generic-agnostic-click-tracking](https://github.com/drewspen/gtm-generic-agnostic-click-tracking)",

If you're not planning on adding more tags, events, and so on, it's ok to leave your existing setup if it's working.\n\nIf you want to move over to GTM, you have to deploy your GTM script, recreate your existing setup in GTM via tags and triggers, consent mode settings, etc, and finally remove the GA4 script from your website. You'll have to do some reading to figure out how everything should be configured to work correctly, but there are lots of free resources out there like Analytics Mania.\n\n>if tags should be merged\n\nGTM can't be merged with other tags, because it's a tag manager/container. It sounds like you've got GA4 and Google Ads already merged and it's ok to leave them like that. If you migrate them to GTM, you'd have 1 Google tag for both (to reflect that they're merged) instead of 2 Google tags (1 for each; that's necessary for people who have separate tags for GA4 and Google Ads, and thus need separate tags in GTM as well).\n\n>you don't need to install multiple individual ID tags and that config options can be shared across tags\n\nThis depends not on GTM, but on your current tag structure (see above). In your case that would be 1 tag (more tags if you decide to add event tracking, conversion tracking, etc in the future). Config options can be set up from the Google Tag settings outside of GTM; you can also set them in GTM but it's not necessary. And the config sharing options are useful for more complex GTM setups, which is not the case yet for you.\n\nIf you decide to migrate, be very very careful about your cookie consent and consent mode setup, refer to the official documentation of the tool you're using.",

You have to add the configuration tag for ga4 if you want to do ga4 custom event tracking through GTM, but you can disable it from counting default events like page views and just leave your original 'hardcoded' ga4 tag.  You can then use GTM for the custom events you want while keeping your original config.  The only cost is complexity and confusion for anyone else that might need to administer the site in the future.  \n\nNot recommended, of course of course BUT absolutely will work.

        "selftext": "# Post Body:\n\nI’m trying to self-host a **Google Tag Manager Server-Side container (sGTM)** using Docker & Docker Compose on my own VPS (Ubuntu).\n\nHere’s what I’ve done so far:\n\n**Setup & steps already done:**\n\n* Installed Docker & Docker Compose.\n* Pulled the official GTM Cloud image: [`gcr.io/cloud-tagging-10302018/gtm-cloud-image:stable`](http://gcr.io/cloud-tagging-10302018/gtm-cloud-image:stable)\n* Wrote a `docker-compose.yml` file for two services:\n   * `gtm-server`\n   * `gtm-preview`\n* Exposed ports `8081`, `8082`, and `8083`.\n* Verified that containers start but then crash.\n\n**What happens now (the issue):**\n\n* Containers (`gtm-server` and `gtm-preview`) **keep restarting/exiting** with:Error: Missing container config. Please provide the CONTAINER\\_CONFIG environment variable or the container\\_config command line option. \n* When I test with:→ I only get **connection refused**.curl -vk [http://localhost:8082/healthz](http://localhost:8082/healthz) curl -vk [http://localhost:8083/healthz](http://localhost:8083/healthz) \n\n**Where I’m stuck / main questions:**\n\n1. I understand the error means the **CONTAINER\\_CONFIG** is missing. Do I need to download a `container_config.json` file from Google Tag Manager UI (Admin → Container Settings → Container Configuration)?\n2. If yes, where exactly should I put that file in my VPS, and how should my `docker-compose.yml` reference it? (env var vs mounted volume).\n3. Does this file need to be updated manually if I publish new versions in GTM, or will the container auto-sync?",

Is this a Consent Mode hiccup? WooCommerce block? Something missing in GA4 settings?\n\nAny help would be super appreciated 🙏",

Try firing a consent\\_update before your ecommerce events.  \n  \nEvent Parameter Structure – GA4 can sometimes ignore events if the items array isn’t exactly as expected. Make sure each item in the array includes item\\_id or item\\_name at minimum.  \n  \nDuplicate GA Tags – If GA4 is loaded both via your plugin and GTM, it can cause unpredictable behavior. Stick with GTM only for cleaner results.  \n  \nThat said, if you want an easier way to capture all Woo events (purchase, add\\_to\\_cart, etc.) without worrying about GA4’s picky behavior or consent handling, I’d highly recommend trying Qwestify. It auto-captures all ecommerce events (even in WooCommerce), works with cookie-less tracking, and needs no extra setup. Might save you from all this debugging madness!",

I haven't found a simple way to refuse the changes and clear the warning. \n\nIt really is safe to ignore. It's frustratingly alarmist, and has no bearing on your tracking.\n\nAs far as I can tell, it's mainly looking at two things. \n\nOne is whether your Google tags fire on a new domain that would require your Conversion Linker tag to have a cross-domain configuration when it's not set up for that. \n\nSince you don't care about that domain, that doesn't matter. I usually see it complaining about dev/staging sites. \n\nThe other (very annoying) thing it looks for is URLs found by Google's search crawlers that have your domain in them, but that your GTM container isn't added to. This frequently includes broken URLs or things like PDFs that you simply can't add GTM to.\n\nIf it flags one of those, you get a warning about \"urgent\" tag issues. If it flags both those things, you get \"critical.\" Usually they're not issues at all.",

        "selftext": "Is there another/better way to capture and send the fbclid URL parameter (which becomes the \\_fbc cookie/parameter) server-side?  Our current method:\n\n\n\nWhen we do tracking setups via GTM/sGTM, for Meta, one of the key components is the fblcid URL parameter for user matching and ad attribution.\n\nIf we're doing a web+server setup (Pixel + CAPI), the Meta Pixel will automatically read and capture the fbclid URL parameter and set it as the \"\\_fbc\" 1st party cookie, and pass it back with the Pixel data automatically.\n\nTo pass that \"fbc\" value server-side, in the web container, we create a 1st party cookie variable for \"\\_fbc\" (and \\_fbp also), and add it as an event object in the GA4 event tag.  (per Meta's documentation here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/guides/gtm-server-side/). Then in the sGTM container, we create an Event Data variable for that parameter, and then set it as the value for the Click ID parameter in the server tag.\n\nIf we're doing a setup that's server-side only (i.e. the Pixel doesn't automatically read the fbclid URL parameter and set the \\_fbc cookie), we use a Cookie Creator tag in GTM to set a 1st party cookie with format fb.1.{{Event Time}}.{{fbclid}}, where fblclid is the URL query variable.\n\n  \nHowever - we recently did a web+server setup on a Shopify store using their Customer Events section, and when we looked at the server container event data coming from the web container, it was saying that the fbc and fbp variables incoming were undefined.  I understand that the fbc parameter is only present if the user came from a paid ad, and thus has the fbclid URL parameter present.  But the \"fbp\" parameter is a device/browser identifier that should pretty much always be available.  \n  \nJust wondering if anyone has a different/better way of capturing and sending the fbc parameter server-side.",

        "selftext": "I run my own brand and web shop on BigCommerce, and am looking for a GTM expert to work with, to implement server-side tracking using Google Tag Manager (or advise me about it). I'm not an engineer, and I do work with a developer for other things. However they aren't a GTM expert.\n\n**The problem:**  \n\\- My Meta event quality and general tracking accuracy is highly variable.  \n\\- This directly impacts ad performance, so I'd like to improve the connection.\n\n**The context:**\n\n\\- My website is built in BigCommerce  \n\\- I use the native BigCommerce GA4 integration for Google Analytics; this seems relatively accurate (within \\~3% usually). However if I do implement a server-side set up for Meta, it feels like it would make sense to set up server-side for GA4 as well.  \n\\- I switched from just client-side Facebook pixel tracking; to both client and server-side.\n\n\\- My current server-side connection for Meta uses the Facebook CAPI gateway; however this is implemented using [Stape.io](http://Stape.io) Meta CAPIG solution, not a full server-side implementation of the Facebook CAPI\n\n\\- Implementing the Meta CAPIG seems to have improved accuracy, but not as much as I would have liked. There are still events where the event quality is variable and weird. For example, purchase events should be able to pass emails 100% of the time; but in Meta Events Manager, I can see this swinging between 33%-100%.\n\n**Potential solutions:**  \n\\- I previously had been using LittleData before they deprecated support for BigCommerce in July.  \n\\- I'm aware of Elevar and other similar solutions, but I believe most of these are focused on Shopify only.  \n\\- I've set up some trial sGTM containers using [Stape.io](http://Stape.io); these do seem to offer a good suite of tools for effectively improving my tracking, which hopefully will feed better data into Facebook.\n\nI know this is not a job board but I'd be looking to find someone to work with on a consulting basis, to avoid trying to DIY it or pushing my current developer too far. Any general advice or pointers would also be appreciated.",

I think it’s worth going down the path of understanding the entire cycle here. \n\nI think you need to look at the big picture, and that is to be able to grab customer data from as many sources as possible, and build a more complete profile on them (from email, quizzes, or any other channels you can). \n\nFeed them into a cdp with a database (like rudderstack, or a more expensive option like segment), then have that platform feed back a full picture to Google ads or meta. You quickly realise that it’s do it manually, or pay an obscene amount of money yearly to have it done for you (adobe cdp etc). This is only typically financially viable to the big boys (like Coca Cola etc). \n\nThe first step is obviously going server side, then future steps would be a CDP. Google Analytics can be made to report well, it just needs quite a bit of setup specific to your situation. \n\nThe amount of data stape is able to catch is amazing. I’m on shopify and klaviyo, but the premise is the same. Tracking is only getting more complicated with each iOS or chrome release, the companies that start building their first party data stores will have such an advantage in the future, and their ad spend will be far more efficient. \n\nChatGPT can be a great help in getting to your goals. I have used it heaps to set this up. It’s overwhelming, but just start with getting your tracking right (stape+GTM), then investigate the next steps from there. Reach out if needed, I basically set this up entirely using chatgpt, so not a professional. But now I have a complete understanding of why this is important. Prompt about planning the ultimate tracking setup for your situation, complain about price, use it to get clear on your goals etc.",

It fires server-side and all, but it's still not quite the same as a full server-side implementation, from what I'm gathering.\n\nIn terms of results, I saw a pretty good uptick in terms of event quality and overall attribution rate at first. Some scores went from \\~6.5-7 to about 8-8.5. But then after a few weeks the gap between purchases that Meta was able to attribute to ads, vs. what I can see in my store, went back up to be quite significant. And even with the server-side tracking set up in Stape CAPIG, some events that I should have 100% data for (for example, \"Purchase\" should always have an email), have some days/weeks where they'll be around 50-75%.

I am \\[CENSORED\\] from Google Ads Conversion tracking and Analytics team. I understand that you are concerned about a few questions related to having two GTM containers on the same page.\n\n>\\> Could you tell me if this is OK to do?\n\nYes, using multiple GTM containers on the same page is supported but usually it is not advised.\n\n>\\>  What issues will I run into?\n\nDuplicate Tags or Conflicts If both containers fire the same tags (e.g., Google Analytics, Ads conversions), it may lead to duplicate data or double-counting of conversions/events. Variable/Data Layer Conflicts Both containers share the same dataLayer, so if variables or event names overlap or are overwritten, it could cause tracking errors or unexpected behavior. Performance Impact Adding more containers can slightly increase page load time, especially if each container loads multiple tags. Debugging Complexity Troubleshooting and debugging becomes more complex with two containers, particularly when using preview/debug mode.\n\n>\\> Do you have any documentation for running multiple GTM containers on site?\n\nThere is no documentation for running multiple GTM containers on a site but you can go through this support article for reference (link to traditionally useless google article that always reads like generated by GPT2: https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9442095?hl=en).\n\nFor any other issues related to GTM containers implementations, That falls beyond my support scope. I would advise you to reach out to your web developer for the implementation related issues.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the situation.

Initial <script> block (before the GTM tag)***\n\n```<script>\n  dataLayer = {\n    'gtm.start': {\n      'GTM-XXXXXXX': true,\n      'GTM-YYYYYYY': true\n    }\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\n**Analysis :**\n\n• Structural error: dataLayer must be an array ([]), not an object ({}). This is a critical error.\n\n• GTM expects an array for dataLayer, so it can .push() objects into it.\n\n• gtag depends on dataLayer as an array → here it will probably crash or misbehave.\n\n***What should be done:***\n\n```<script>\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  dataLayer.push({\n    'gtm.start': {\n      'GTM-XXXXXXX': true,\n      'GTM-YYYYYYY': true\n    }\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n***2. Loading the GTM script***\n\n```<script src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js\"></script>\n<script>\n  gtag('js', {\n    'gtm.start': dataLayer['gtm.start']\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n**Analysis :**\n\n• This script loads Google Analytics via gtag.js, not Google Tag Manager.\n\n• gtag('js', {...}) initializes GA4, not GTM.\n\n• The call to dataLayer['gtm.start'] will be erroneous if dataLayer is not an object structured as expected (see error above).\n\n**Structural problem:**\n\n• The author is mixing GA4 (gtag.js) and GTM here, when what he wants to do is load several GTM containers, not initialize GA.\n\n***3. Noscript for fallback***\n\n\n```<noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXXX,GTM-YYYYYYY\"\nheight=\"0\" width=\"0\" style=\"display:none;visibility:hidden\"></iframe></noscript>\n```\n\n**Analysis :**\n\n• GTM does not allow multiple IDs to be chained in the URL this way: id=GTM-XXXXXXX,GTM-YYYYYYY is non-compliant.\n\n• Result: probably only the first container will be loaded, or none at all.\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\n- Compliance with GTM standards: ❌ (poorly structured dataLayer, bad GTM script, invalid noscript)\n\n- GA4 / GTM separation: ❌ \nConfusion between gtag.js and gtm.js\n\n- Impact on performance:⚠️ \nMay slow down loading or create conflicts\n\n- Risks: Bad triggering of tags, missing data, JavaScript errors\n\n**=Bullshit tips**",

I started posting on this subreddit when I found something interesting I discovered. I also replied to people having difficulties. I wasn't going to do freelance, but I had one, then two, then ten people message me here with variations of \"I'm really stuck, can you help? I'll pay\".\n\nThe course alone isn't going to get you there, though. You need to do the course, become curious and start running tests and little experiments on your own. You need to keep doing that untl you've gone though a hundred wrong ways of doing something so that you really understand it, know how to diagnose when someone else has done it the wrong way and intuitively know how to fix it.\n\nIt took me 3 months to get to grips with GTM. 6 months to get good. A year to become comfortable and 2 years to be near expert level.\n\nIt's not just GTM though. Learning HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation, JS and RegEx are all vital. There's more to it than even all that, but as long as you remain curious and interested, you will do fine.\n\nEDIT: I realise this doesn't directly answer most of your questions. All I will say is you will know yourself when you're at the point where you can take on gigs. You'll probably mess up once or twice early on. Everyone does.",

I had no real idea of GTM's power, either. In the years since, I've worked with agencies, and for one, but only recently am I working with an agency that knows how and why solutions do or don't impact site performance; or how to collect and purge temporary E-commerce event parameters via html tags to facilitate complex attribution modeling; or makes quick work of complex consent mode issues, etc etc etc. They don't get confused or befuddled. They work quickly but thoughtfully. The point of all of that is there are a lot of tiers proficiency \"beyond the blog\" so beware those feelings of supremacy and over confidence that come with successful learning. There's always more and better.\n\nGetting off the soapbox, Julius is awesome, and that's ambitious place to start, so good on you! But all courses are built around controlled scenarios - good to best cases where you complete steps and achieve predictable outcomes. The problem is that unless every gig is working from a clean slate, on a well developed site built on a simple analytics-friendly tech stack, courses don't get you very far, or  even worse, can get you in trouble because you know enough to be dangerous and you deem yourself  qualified after a course. In reality, if you want work, you're most likely going to walk into messy containers, broken things, and a dataLayer in chaos...a bunch of tech debt because unlucky paid social strategists have drawn the short straw over the years and had to \"do the GTM\". Folks that probably could't make it two paragraphs into a Julius post. Those are the people that are ready to write checks and hire you because they truly need you.\n\nIn short, I'd caution against taking any jobs that might test you too soon, and I'd have some heartfelt conversations with ChatGPT about how you can overwrite the dataLayer, or break E-commerce tracking, or render inoperable one of two add to cart buttons on the site, or otherwise fuck up a website in ways that lose money or data because you didn't test, or you published some JS you found on a blog or ChatGPT wrote for you that you don't really understand.\n\nSome very boring advice to take or leave: \n\nWhen you're working in someone's container, create workspaces for projects so that you can publish modularly, and don't modify default workspace ever - it's the current state of the site. \n\nIf you're adding pixels/script tags, test E-commerce and any other important events in Preview before publishing.\n\n Publish when you know you'll be able keep an eye on it for a day or two after (i.e., not the day before you're leaving for vacation). \n\nPut together an SDR and a business requirements doc and actually use them. Don't do anything until the business case for work is clearly understood by you and the client. \n\nIf you're hired to build tracking for a website, have a flexible overall tracking strategy you've thought through beforehand that doesn't include event tags for every event, and isn't going to max out your custom definitions in three months. DON'T figure it out \"as you go along\" haha. \n\nTracking is about aggregation and reporting - what will your reports or other outputs look like downstream? Will they serve the business case or did the solution wander? \n\nBe extra tidy...use folders. Document your events and work in a Google Sheet or somewhere else outside of GTM so devs and others without access to GTM know what you did. \n\nBe consistent with formatting and naming conventions, e.g. all dataLayer variables look like \"DL - customEvent\".\n\nA lot of boring non-GTM-fun stuff I know, but you're talking about starting a business after all. Freelancing is \"fun\", but you're going to be way ahead of the curve if you roll like a professional!\n\nGood luck!",

All event data from the imported tags in Container A is now being sent to the GA4 property connected with Container B.However, the original GTM container and GA4 property (Container A + GA4 A) are still active. So currently, two GA4 properties are collecting data for the same website hostname — one via the original setup, and one via the new one.The issue:  \nWhen comparing GA4 event data between the original property (GA4 A) and the new property (GA4 B), I’m seeing a **significant data discrepancy** for the same hostname. The volumes are far off, and I’m unable to pinpoint the root cause.Some additional context:\n\n* I have already paused the tags in *Container B* that could potentially interfere with *Container A* — particularly marketing-related tags that weren’t needed on the other site.\n* Even after doing that, the numbers did **not** improve.\n* My initial suspicion was that there might be interference — e.g., conflicting `gtag` instances, consent settings, or tag sequencing issues due to both containers being present on the same pages.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar discrepancies when running multiple containers on the same domain?  \nCould conflicting tags or consent issues cause data loss or suppression like this?Thanks in advance for your help!Let me know if you want to include logs, screenshots, or GTM debug notes in a follow-up.",

Ideally, the cleanest way to do this is to use one future proof Google Account/Gmail Address to set up both. To take it a step further, it’s so much easier if you setup ALL of your Google platforms (GA4, GTM, GSC, GADs, GBP, GLSA, etc.) using the same future proof Google Account/Gmail Address.\n\n* This will help mitigate any potential issues down the road like forgetting which email address you used to setup each platform, how to log into what, forgetting your password, having multiple accounts on more than one platform, and a myriad of other issues that come along with using multiple email addresses.\n\n**For a service area business (SAB) like electricians, contractors, HVAC, remodeling, handyman, roofing, etc., the most important GTM tags/triggers should focus on tracking:**\n\n1. how people ***contact*** you via the website\n2. how people ***interact*** with the website\n3. how people ***access*** the website\n\n# Track How People Contact You From The Website\n\nThe most common tags/triggers you’ll need to set up are for form submissions, phone call clicks, email clicks, and scheduling/booking. Essentially, you want to make it as easy as possible for someone on your website to contact you, and track every contact method. The goal is, if there is a way for someone to contact you on the website, set up a tag/trigger to track it. If you don’t do anything else, do this.\n\nThe types of tags/triggers you set up will vary based on the platforms you’re using for: a CRM (ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, etc.), forms (Gravity Forms, Cognito Forms, etc.), call tracking (CallRail, Invoca, etc.), and scheduling. This is one example of why you want the strategy ironed out before you start setting up tags willy nilly and wasting your time.\n\n# Track How People Interact With The Website\n\nGA4 has auto event tracking and enhanced measurement events (when turned on). These will track a lot of user interactions by default. However, you may want to consider alternatives since you’re looking to create more robust tracking. Using a heatmap tracking tool is great for getting a visual representation of how people interact with the website. You can use GTM to implement the tracking code for most (if not all) heatmap tools.\n\nWhen you know how people are interacting with your website, it allows you to refine your marketing strategies, optimize your user experience, and get better results if you are analyzing the data. If you don’t have someone monitoring, tracking, analyzing, optimizing, testing, etc., then you just end up collecting a bunch of data. It’s not necessarily a bad thing to have all that data, but it can be overwhelming if you don’t know what to do with it or have anyone to utilize it.\n\nAdditionally, I’ve worked with electricians and other home services businesses that offer coupons, referrals, or specials on their website. If you want to do something like this, then you’ll need to decide how you’re gonna do it and track accordingly.\n\n# Track How People Access The Website\n\n* **Paid Ads Tracking:** Since you are focusing on Google and FB Ads, you’ll want to setup tags for both in GTM. To do that, you’ll need to create the ad accounts first. If you’re unsure how to do this, you can do a quick Google Search - most platforms have specific implementation directions. If you’re doing Reddit ads, there is a tag for that as well. The same goes for most other paid ad platforms you might use like Bing/Microsoft Ads, Houzz Ads, Nextdoor Ads, Instagram Ads, etc.\n* **Organic Tracking:** Set up Google Search Console if you haven’t already, and connect it to GA4 & GADS. GSC is (IMO) just as important as GA4 and provides in-depth Google ranking data. You’ll also use it to submit/resbumit your sitemap, test live URLs, request indexing, disavow backlinks, and more - which will be very helpful once you start using your tracking to implement changes.\n   * UTM parameters are a gonna be your BFF to track the source/medium of organic users or sessions in GA4 & GSC. Use UTM parameters with any external link that directs traffic to your website: email campaigns, QR codes, Google Business Profile, social/social-adjacent profiles and posts (I’m including directories and listings with social, like: FB, Insta, LinkedIn, Nextdoor, Yelp, Bing Places, apple Maps), other websites, etc. Make sure to keep a list of these for reference and trouble shooting as you set them up.\n   * You can also use GTM to track outbound link clicks. So, if you have your social profiles on your website, you’ll be able to track when people click from your website to those platforms. This also comes in handy if you work with other companies for referrals, have preferred vendors, or add any links to other websites on yours.\n\n# Additional Suggestions\n\nI’m not going to go too much into retargeting, because that’s another novella :) However, I do want to make sure to emphasize *the importance of* ***local SEO*** *for your industry and all other SABs*. Paid ads are more of a short-term, lever style strategy, while SEO is a long-term strategy. Once you stop spending money on paid ads, the traffic stops too. SEO is going to stay with you, and improve your digital marketing performance long-term. It requires consistent updates, and, if you implement it correctly and keep up with algorithm updates, the faucet never really turns off.\n\nIf you want to rank organically for your services in your local cities and neighborhoods, you’ll want a SOLID local SEO strategy. This includes geo pages, schema, and a well maintained Google Business Profile among other things. Tracking your SEO is necessary for growing and improving your digital presence, so if you’re thinking about tracking - you’ve probably already considered this. I talk to a lot of SABs that don’t understand how important this is, so it’s my due diligence to pass along the knowledge!\n\nGood luck with everything, and may the algorithmic force be with you!\n\n&nbsp;\n*edit (1&2): formatting*",

Why do I want to add the google ads tag to my GTM and website if Google ads already tracks data in Google ads dashboard.\n2. Is it possible to use the same Google Ads tag in each of my websites' GTM and will it differentiate between the different website sources?\n3. Will this help me to understand more of the customer flow? i.e. Customer sees ad, clicks on it, goes to website, visits a few pages, click on button to book appointment, then goes to appt booking site(I assume this is the conversion but this is a third party site which we do own the site so we can track data in there as well)\n\nMaybe this is above my head and should get an expert involved but I figured I'd ask here first.

Why do want to add the google ads tag to my GTM and website if Google ads already tracks data in Google ads dashboard. \n\nIf you're using one ads account for multiple businesses, this might start to get messy when looking at the data. Moving to GTM might help you clean it up a bit, but you'll need to start over. \n\nTo answer your question, people prefer GTM because you can add non-google tags (like a Facebook pixel), and also you can make changes to your tags without having to reinstall the code every time. You need to add the Google Ads tag to GTM if you choose to use GTM or you won't be able to edit the Google tag with GTM. If you set up both, you might also end up duplicating data \n\nThink of Tag Manager as a Squarsespace like software and the Google tag is the website itself. You can either hire a developer to edit your site, or hook your site up to Squarsespace and edit it yourself. \n\n\n\n2. Is it possible to use the same Google Ads tag in each of my websites' GTM and will it differentiate between the different website sources? \n\nIt would make it hard to differentiate the data. You are better off having a different Google Tag for every business and a different GTM container for every business. \n\n3. Will this help me to understand more of the customer flow? i.e. Customer sees ad, clicks on it, goes to website, visits a few pages, click on button to book appointment, then goes to appt booking site(l assume this is the conversion but this is a third party site which we do own the site so we can track data in there as well)\n\nWhen you set it up, also incorporate GA4 and you will be able to build out reports that show the funnel. So yes, you will be able to see the overall flow, but ads itself doesn't really show this on its own. You'll also likely need to set up a conversion linker with GTM if you need to measure a journey across your site and possibly multiple domains.",

I inserted a redirect script via `theme.liquid` to forward any visitors who land there back to the new frontend.\n\nThe issue:\n\n* Google Analytics 4 **correctly tracks** the purchase event.\n* Google Tag Manager **fails to fire** the purchase event on Shopify’s “Thank You” page.\n* All other GTM events like **add to cart**, **view item**, etc., work perfectly on the frontend domain.\n* The “Thank You” page exists in the Shopify-hosted environment, and GTM doesn’t seem to trigger properly there—likely due to the multi-domain setup.\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n\n* Validated that the GTM purchase tag is set up correctly with the proper trigger and event.\n* Checked that the data layer is present and has the right structure post-purchase.\n* Attempted to inject GTM into the order status page using Shopify’s additional scripts section.\n* Made sure GTM is container-loaded properly in both environments.\n\nDespite all this, the purchase tag still doesn’t fire. It appears GTM doesn’t properly detect the event on Shopify’s side when running a headless setup.

        "selftext": "I built an online booking page for a client, with a Stripe Elements payment form.\n\nGTM works great up until customers check out: it's effectively a single-page app, and the SPA adds events to the GTM window.dataLayer, recording how the customer progresses through the steps in the booking process.\n\nBut when the customer submits the Stripe payment form itself, there's a sequence of redirects:\n\n* They start at [myclientdomain.com/bookings/](http://myclientdomain.com/bookings/)\n* Customer payment details are submitted to [something.stripe.com](http://something.stripe.com)\n* Depending on the payment method, Stripe might redirect the customer to [customersbank.com](http://customersbank.com), and the bank redirects to Stripe\n* After successful payment, Stripe redirects to [myclientdomain.com/payment\\_complete.php](http://myclientdomain.com/payment_complete.php) and my code post-processes the booking\n* I redirect to [myclientdomain.com/bookings/](http://myclientdomain.com/bookings/) , SPA shows a \"Thank you - all done\" screen\n\nBut after the redirects, it seems that **a new window.dataLayer is initialised**, containing only a \"booking-completed\" event from the SPA. So my client doesn't see the \"booking-completed\" event in GTM along with the other events relating to the customer''s journey through the booking app.\n\nI could avoid one of my own redirects, but I don't think I can avoid the customer being redirected to Stripe's domain, maybe a bank's domain, then back.\n\nHas anyone else solved this kind of issue? Recovering a GTM dataLayer after redirects, or using something like a GTM session ID to add post-redirect events into a pre-existing GTM session?\n\nThanks!",

This is the last blocker before I can confidently launch enhanced conversions for Google Ads.\n\nThanks in advance",

I double-checked and unfortunately, the current Formie setup doesn’t expose any editable success template or frontend block where we could inject code. The AJAX submission with redirect is all handled internally, and I don’t have access to modify Twig templates or use webhooks. So while the idea of using a webhook or payload listener is smart, it’s not doable here without dev support. Trying to override fetch/XHR would be too fragile for production, so I’m leaning toward a GTM-only frontend solution that listens to formie:submitSuccess and safely pushes the email after a delay.

        "id": "1jvgiqp",
        "selftext": "Hey Marketers of Reddit,\n\nI’m running into a bit of an issue with two of my clients. The problem is that I haven’t been able to get Google Tag Manager to properly track phone call conversions. I’ve gone through multiple videos, asked both Grok 3 and ChatGPT 4.5, but so far, no luck. Before I go ahead and spend money on a third-party call tracking service, I figured I’d check in here first and see if anyone might be able to steer me in the right direction.\n\nIn Google’s Tag Assistant, when I open up the conversion tag I set up, under the “Firing Triggers” section, here’s what I see:\n\n* ✅ Click URL | starts with | tel:\n* ✅ \\_event | equals | gtm.linkClick\n* ❌ \\_triggers | matches RegEx | (\\^$|((\\^|,)217146610\\_16($|,)))\n\nThat last “event” (not really sure what the proper term is), according to ChatGPT, means this:\n\n“This is GTM’s internal condition to ensure tags only fire if the correct triggers are matched. This particular cryptic RegEx expression ((\\^$|((\\^|,)217146610\\_16($|,)))) means:  \n‘Only fire this tag if the specific internal trigger ID (217146610\\_16) matches exactly.’  \nIf the internal GTM trigger ID doesn’t match, GTM blocks the tag from firing (hence the red X).  \nIt’s a condition auto-generated by GTM internally, not something you explicitly added.”\n\nThe frustrating part is I’ve tried configuring these tags in multiple ways—using a custom variable with the correct measurement ID, testing different tag types, everything I can think of—and it’s still not working.\n\nAt this point, I’d appreciate any insight. It’s starting to feel almost impossible to track any kind of conversion with GTM and Google—even something as basic as a form submission.\n\n  \nThanks for an input on this matter\n\nSincerely,\n\nMako",

But here is my perspective:\n\n**If a client can get CAPI “for free” via a plugin, what’s the practical reason to implement sGTM instead?**  \nIn a word, control. With plugin solutions, you often have limited control of things: Limited control on when tracking starts (which is a problem if you are in the EU), limited control of what parameters are sent with the conversion event, limited control in terms of what triggers you can use.  \n\n\nWhen we cancelled our PixelYOurSite Pro-subscribtion, it was because all of the factors above held us back from creating the best setups from our clients.\n\n  \n**Are both technically doing “server-side tracking”, or is that term being stretched in the case of plugins?**  \nIn my experience, they are both genuine server side tracking. The difference is in the answer to your third question...\n\n  \n**How do you justify the added cost and effort of sGTM to clients,** **especially if the plugin appears to \"just work\"?**  \nPlugin solutions often force you to use a server URL that has nothing to do with your domain - which makes all the cookies placed through the plugin third party cookies. A big part of server-side tracking is only placing 1st party cookies.\n\nAlso, in my experience, plugins are less stable. CMS updates, browser updates etc - so much can cause a plugin to stop working. \"Proper\" server side implementering through Google Tag Manager just works much more stable.\n\nFinally, paid server hosting solutions (Like Stape.io) have some amazing extra features like custom loaders (preventing ad blockers from detecting and removing GTM scripts) and Cookie keeper (extending the lifetime of cookies from 7 days to 31 days), which lead to more conversion data being sent.",

The hard part is getting the correct 1%...that will be a challenge for AI.\n\nSaid another way: the success of such an AI product is dependent upon the ability of clients to clearly articulate their marketeing strategy and plans.\n\nStepping back a bit: setting up tracking isn't our pain point.  Once you have a small group of productive tags in place, it runs itself and might add one tag per year for special situations.  But we've never had more than 30-40 tags...GA4/GTM causes us huge amounts of grief, but setting up tagging or tracking plans isn't on. But that's us...",

Sometimes third-party scripts or JS conflicts prevent the event from fully propagating to the level where GTM listens for it\n\n**Possible solutions:**\n\n• Use the “Just Links” trigger for your `<a>`buttons. This ensures that the Click Classes variable will be correctly populated and that the trigger will work as expected.\n\n• Verify that the built-in Click Classes and Click Element variables are enabled in GTM so that class information is available in your triggers.\n\n• If you absolutely must use “All Elements”, you may need to investigate the theme scripting side (Salient) or add a custom script to manually push the information into the dataLayer",

For context, we own a resort, so there’s some cross-domain tracking happening between our site and Cloudbeds.\n\nToday, I was about to start running some ads when I noticed in events manager that there were a lot of duplicate events (especially purchases). I spent hours testing and trying to figure it out, but nothing has worked so far. Out of frustration, I decided to pause both the pixel and GA4 event tags to see if that would fix it....To my surprise, even with those tags paused, events were still being triggered in the test events section of Events Manager. I’ve gone through wordpress looking for any plugins or code that might’ve been injected and causing this issue, but I haven’t found anything yet. I still need to check GA4 and Google Ads to see if they might somehow be firing the events. Or could it be Cloudbeds that’s triggering them?\n\nI’ve thought about implementing server-side tracking, but that feels like a bit of a leap right now. I figured I’d ask for some advice first before heading down that route.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EdWKZTB](https://imgur.com/a/EdWKZTB)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",

I’ve also experimented with using `gtag` (auto-updated version), but still no luck — Google Ads doesn't seem to pick up the values.\n\nHas anyone here successfully implemented something similar through GTM for Google Ads custom variable?

Any tips or advice to point me in the right direction would be deeply appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance",

HOWEVER for best iframe tracking you'll want to use the JavaScript postMessage method to send data from the iframe on the mariana tek site (the iframe) to the parent page (the SquareSpace site). It's easies to do this with two iframes - one for each site.\n\nThis will get you the best results. You can install the same GTM on both sites but you run into duplicate page views, cross domain issues, and other problems.\n\nI can share my mariana tek container with you to import so you can then receive all the events on your main SquareSpace container if you'd like. I'm not quite done with it and I still need to deploy but I should be done tomorrow.",

        "id": "1j8dxn4",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m running into an issue with Google Ads' latest updates that’s messing with our usual conversion tracking workflow. Previously, we used **Google Tag Manager (GTM)** to manually set up conversion actions, allowing us to specify the **conversion ID and label** for tracking performance across different pages.\n\nUntil recently, there was an option to **“Add a conversion action manually using code”** when setting up a new conversion in Google Ads. However, this option seems to have disappeared. Now, when I go to **Tools & Settings > Conversions > Create a new conversion action**, I’m forced into a setup that directly links to **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** instead of letting me manually define conversion events through GTM.\n\nHere’s what happens now:\n\n1. I select “Website” as my conversion source and enter the domain.\n2. Instead of an option to manually create a conversion, I’m immediately prompted to choose a **recommended conversion category** (e.g., “Submit lead form”).\n3. When I proceed, it **forces me to select an event from GA4** instead of allowing me to input a manual conversion ID and label, like we used to do.\n\nThis shift seems to push everyone into **Google Ads tracking via GA4**, rather than enabling **GTM-based conversions**. While GA4 integration isn’t necessarily bad, we **still want the flexibility to manage and fire specific conversion events via GTM** without being locked into Analytics.\n\nI’ve tried:\n\n* Looking for an **“Add manually using code”** option—can’t find it.\n* Checking different Google Ads accounts—same issue, or if the account is old enough, it is still available.\n\nHas anyone else run into this? Did Google officially remove this feature, or is there a workaround to **keep using GTM for manual conversion tracking**?\n\nWould appreciate any insight—thanks in advance!",

Web Analytics is, however, scalable. You need to be able to generate insights around your users' checkout and other behaviors - insights related to however your client/job/boss defines site success, conversion, etc. I used to think that knowing Javascript would be helpful, but smart businesses don't want you to \"moonlight\" as a JS or other developer; rather, they want (you) to delegate those tasks to developers that hold dev titles, which makes sense. So, demonstrating the ability to provide specs and work with devs to implement them are IMO more desirable for most Web Analyst roles.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't put any stock in knowing GA4 beyond what you absolutely need to. It's buggy, the reporting is bad, and it's functionally horrible. Knowing GA4 is essentially just the required platform for collection. Get to know Looker studio, as that's where you'll likely be doing a lot of reporting, and then dig into querying the raw data via SQL/BigQuery.

Everyone's experiences are different, so just my take:\n\n**Data Literacy**: I'm in my third web analytics and educating around data literacy, KPI, measurement planning, etc. are still a very fundamental part of the job. It has been in all three jobs. In my current role, the most challenging part of it responding to lots and lots of requests. That's a good problem to have though; if people aren't motivated/interested, it's not easy to fix that. It's not like you can hold them accountable, and who would want to do that anyway?\n\n**Implementation**: It's also normal to implement lots of things that people don't ultimately use if KPI/measurement planning isn't effective. You've probably realized this already: KPIs and/or desired insights, hypotheses should be part of the original dataLayer/tracking spec. Otherwise, you'll inevitably get data requests around what you aren't tracking.\n\n**BigQuery/SQL**: The data warehousing/ingestion part (BigQuery) isn't something you would do by your self probably. Most companies big enough to pay you a living wage as a web analyst will probably have database devs to set that up. SQL is, well, SQL. If you enjoy it, you can learn it. If you're querying raw GA4 data, there are some wrinkles that you don't find in typical database structures, however. Honestly, yes, there's a learning curve if you're starting from zero, but don't let that dissuade you. SQL skills are highly valuable. If you know SQL, you'll probably always have a job IMO, and not just in Web Analytics. A lot of people make SQL their thing and build careers around it. If you like data, it's fun stuff.\n\nAs far as GA4 is concerned, I think using SQL to query GA4 data will soon be a required skill for GA related web analyst jobs if it isn't already. The reason is that the reporting interface sucks, and there are lots of gotchas in the UI. Want to share an Exploration? Sure, but you have share it to everyone in the org and only you can change the date range. LOL. It's that bad. My explorations are constantly sampled, and I'm finding discrepancies between what are supposed to duplicate, unsampled reports. That's a dealbreaker.   \n  \nAs it is, I think GA4 is destined to be primarily a configured collection tool that you visualize in Looker (or other) and/or query directly from a data warehouse to build reports. The reporting UI is just too hard to sell to people as a viable and useful tool, and the Reporting API just doesn't feel reliable.",

If you can do a thank you page, then you can do pretty much all events. There are some tricky parts to do with cookie banners but they are generally one off jobs and no recurring revenue. \n\nI would move in to ads. With ai taking over, you need to feed the algorithms with accurate data. A lot of people are behind. You'll be able to make a lot more running good campaigns for people using your tracking knowledge than trying to get paid for tagging. \n\nThat's the route I'm going down. Paid ads for a monthly recurring fee Vs one off fix your tracking. The former is better.",

Dimensions like page\\_path will report identically provided only the domain has changed.\n\nI don't know why you'd need to do anything at all as far as getting tags to fire - as someone else said, conversion linker is irrelevant here.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nHope you're all well! Just trying to get an idea of what other people think about using tools like Ringside Data and perhaps the likes of Claritas, Resonate, etc. vs using ssGTM and GA4 to improve overall attribution.\n\nLooking at the documentation, it seemed like Rinsgside is doing it all in server-side, first-party context with their own attribution and modelling (similar to DDA in GA4).\n\nPerhaps, the real question is - what is it that these tools bring in that we cannot achieve with the existing setup or upgrading it to ssGTM / GA4?\n\nThank you!",

        "selftext": "Hi everybody!\n\nI'm a GTM noob trying to learn more. I've done my googling, asked ChatGPT, the whole nine yards, but I'm still not 100% sure if GTM can cover my use case. Hoping one of y'all can help.\n\nI was wondering if GTM, in tandem with a first party cookie setup, could be used as a simple affiliate tracker. I run a niche political merchandise store and my product sells so-so online, but sells extremely well in person. So I partnered with a some local sellers who sell the merch in person through an affiliate link I generated via a domain link on bitly. Some of these sellers post the link as a QR code on their stalls or on their business cards and others post the link on their social media accounts. There are probably other ways they sell, but this accounts for the bulk of the traffic.\n\nI ran a couple tests with GA4 and see the rough makings of this being possible via the traffic and sale attribution features of GA4, but I noticed the accuracy was a bit off. That led me down a rabbit hole where I started learning about why data attribution can be spotty and how to fill the gaps using GTM, server side tracking, and first party cookies.\n\nI have a little bit of coding knowledge so I know I can pass conversion information directly from my website to a simple application I made that tracks clicks and conversions by affiliate link. \n\nBut this almost feels too simple? Will this setup give me high/near-perfect sale attribution accuracy (anything 90% or above would suffice) or am I missing something?\n\nFor those curious, I know there are affiliate apps out there already, but I don't need all of their features (and therefore cost) and honestly am kinda on a warpath to learn how this works anyway lol.\n\nSorry if this isn't a super clear question, I honestly am kinda grabbing around in the dark haha. Hope someone can help!\n\nThanks,   \nWalrus",

You're right, it's absolutely not the best way.\n\nIf you want to use \"old school\" (non Google Consent Mode) consent control in GTM, the absolute best way to do this is by creating a Custom Event trigger with a regex match against \".\\*\" (i.e., all events) and a condition that looks for the presence of e.g. C0004 and if it's not there, the trigger will fire. Use this as an exception trigger added to every tag that requires C0004 consent.\n\nThere's a community gallery custom variable by \"taneli-salonen1\" that is possibly the best way to retrieve the C000X values because it looks at both the data layer and the relevant cookie. Super reliable.\n\nThus adding consent requirements to a tag is just adding the relevant exception trigger. Even works for tags that need both analytics and marketing consent, just add both exception triggers.\n\n  \nWhere you have existing tags firing on All Pages, DOM Ready, Initialization etc., you will have to move those to a Custom Event trigger of OneTrustGroupsUpdated. Doing this is a matter of editing the trigger, clicking on the trigger type and changing it to Custom Event. This way you keep any existing additional trigger conditions. Saves you having to create a new trigger and manually recreating the conditions, which is long-winded and prone to error.\n\nAll that being said, it's *so* much easier to implement Google Consent Mode!",

How could you know what to update before the choosing?\n\n\n\"firing in the US\" and \"everything that was blocked before now fires\" - Why is your initial state blocked? That is EU / GDPR - not US. US is opted in (not blocked) until explicitly opted out. \n\n\n\"OneTrust support team main solution seems to be that you create specific triggers\" - This has not been the correct/ modern way to configure OneTrust since October 2023. Use the GCM integration technique that OneTrust publishes on their web site. Following the instructions for using the tag template integrated with Google Consent Mode. On the individual tags set the consent settings. All CMPs (CookieYes, CookieBot, CookieHub, etc) work nearly identical to this.\n\n\n\"issues with the Autoblocker\" - The technique that OneTrust details on their web site does not employ the obsolete autoblocker.\n\n\n\"trigger/fire the blocked cookies\" - You do not trigger the cookies. You trigger the JavaScript tags. The cookies are just small tools that the tags use to 'remember' things - like PostIt notes. The tags are 'the thing'. All modern Consent Management Platforms (CMPs - the C stands for Consent not Cookie) including OneTrust control the firing of JavaScript tags and also the older image pixel tag technique.\n\n\n\"UTM tags\" - UTMs are not tags. UTMs are initial site landing URL query string parameters. Specifically URL query string parameters that trace their use back decades to the Urchin Tracking Module web analytics product offering.\n\nhttps://my.onetrust.com/s/article/UUID-d81787f6-685c-2262-36c3-5f1f3369e2a7?language=en_US",

        "selftext": "I am a marketing professional struggling with a change in GA4 since I asked our web team to switch from gtag.js to GTM and wondering if anyone has similar experience and / or a fix! \n\nI’ve noticed that GA4 has suggested we’ve dropped in terms of website visitors by 50% compared to the month before. It looks like we had a big dip around late September when the GTM switch went live and we haven’t recovered.\n\nThis also doesn’t appear to show in other platforms. While GA4 suggests a 50% drop in organic search visits, Google Search Console indicates we’re doing better than ever, up 10% on that period, with no dip in clicks through to our site. \n\nI am a bit lost as to next steps. I can’t see anything about GA4 changes or updates - what could be affecting us here? Is there a possibility that our tag or GTM has been set up incorrectly?",

I personally would still learn some basics to just understand better what to ask, but that's up to you.\n\nOn the other hand, if your goal is to start working in an agency or go freelance with multiple clients, I would learn a bit more of JS, including things like callbacks, async, promises etc.\n\nMy experience in digital analytics shows that JS is especially helpful at debugging - understanding how your code is executed, if it is affected by other scripts on the page, what exactly is being pushed to the dataLayer, etc. You wouldn't know what to ask ChatGPT if you don't understand how the whole thing is supposed to work. \n\nSo, if you have time and you are thinking about developing your career in digital analytics, go for it!",

                "body": "That’s a super common and frustrating issue when dealing with forms that don’t fire standard events, especially with HubSpot forms embedded via a WordPress plugin and then redirecting to an external site like Calendly.\n\nYou’re right on track thinking the HubSpot/WordPress combo is causing some funkiness, as these embedded forms often operate within an iframe or use AJAX, which GTM's built-in \"Form Submission\" listener often can’t detect.\n\nSince the built-in form submission listener, a regular click trigger, and even the page view of the Calendly page didn't work, here are a couple of solid tracking ideas for the conversion, followed by why you should consider upgrading your setup.\n\nFirst, your most reliable conversion tracking point is likely either detecting a successful form submit event *before* the redirect, or tracking the Calendly page view after the redirect.\n\nSince the simple page view didn't work (likely due to cross-domain issues with Calendly and GA4), let's tackle the HubSpot form first.\n\nHubSpot forms are known to push an event to the data layer on successful submission, but you need a custom listener for it.\n\nYou should try to set up a Custom HTML tag in GTM to listen for the `hsFormCallback` event, specifically looking for `onFormSubmitted`.\n\nThis script would push a new custom event like `hubspot_form_success` into the data layer, which you can then use to fire your GA4 event tag.\n\nIf you search for \"HubSpot GTM custom event listener,\" you'll find the specific JavaScript snippet you need to place in a Custom HTML tag, set to fire on all pages where the form appears.\n\nOnce you have that working, create a Custom Event trigger in GTM using the event name you pushed (e.g., `hubspot_form_success`) and assign it to your GA4 tag (e.g., event name `generate_lead` or `form_submit`).\n\nThis will capture the event *before* the redirect.\n\nAlternatively, since you mentioned they are redirected to Calendly, if you have access to modify the Calendly page setup, the best way to track the final action is by utilizing Calendly's own event listener logic, which can push events like `calendly.event_scheduled` to your data layer.\n\nHowever, since your conversion is the *form submission* that *leads* to the Calendly page, the HubSpot listener is the most direct solution.\n\nIf you still want to track the *booking* on Calendly, you'd need another custom HTML listener tag on the Calendly page (if embedded on your domain) or use the redirect page view with GTM's cross-domain linking enabled for your GA4 configuration tag.\n\nGiven your setup, let's stick to the HubSpot event listener as the primary fix for the form submission.\n\nNow, regarding your overall setup for the sales campaign, the combination of LinkedIn Conversions API + Facebook Conversions API + Google Tag Manager + Stape is a powerhouse solution for maximum campaign accuracy.\n\nThe reason is that both LinkedIn and Facebook's ad platforms rely on receiving timely and accurate conversion data to optimize their ad delivery algorithms - they need to know which users converted so they can find more like them.\n\nClient-side tracking alone (using just the Facebook Pixel or LinkedIn Insight Tag) is unreliable now due to ad-blockers, aggressive browser privacy features like Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) in Safari and others, and increasing cookie restrictions.\n\nThis results in significant data loss, which means your ad platforms are optimizing based on incomplete information, driving up your cost per conversion and reducing campaign performance.\n\nBy implementing server-side tracking, ideally via a managed service like Stape that simplifies the setup and hosting, you use Google Tag Manager's server container to send your conversion data (like the form submission you're trying to track) directly from your server to the ad platforms' Conversions APIs (Facebook's CAPI and LinkedIn's CAPI).\n\nThis server-to-server connection bypasses those browser limitations, ensuring your ad platforms receive nearly 100% of your conversion data, which improves your campaign performance, lowers your cost per action (CPA), and increases your match quality score because you can securely send more reliable user data for attribution.\n\nIn short, it’s a modern, privacy-respecting way to future-proof your tracking against browser changes and get the best return on ad spend for your valuable campaigns.",

The fact that tags fire in preview but get blocked in production is a classic sign of this.\n\nFew things to check:\n\n1. Make sure you've implemented proper consent management - especially for ad-related tags. Those functions getting blocked (`__ogt_ads_datatos`, etc) are typically related to consent/privacy stuff\n\n1. For cross domain tracking - double check that both domains are properly configured in your GTM settings AND analytics property settings. Easy to miss one side\n\n1. Check if you're using any ad blockers or privacy extensions in your testing browser vs production\n\n1. Verify your GA4 configuration tag is firing before any other tags that depend on it\n\nWhat helped me solve this recently was implementing a consent management platform properly and making sure all advertising/analytics tags only fire after consent is granted. With b2b advertising specifically, getting this tracking setup right is super important for campaign optimization.\n\nhappy to share more specific tips if you need em - proper tracking setup makes a huge difference in campaign performance! lmk what u find when u check those items",

When they click the 'Confirm booking' button, they are then sent an authentication code via email/SMS. Once confirmed, they are redirected to the final completion URL /success\n\nI'm seeing a massive difference between the number of clicks on the confirm booking button, and the 'actual' confirmed bookings on the /success URL. Any ideas why this might be, and how I can prevent users from dropping out of the path, which I think is happening due to the authentication code part of the process in GTM?",

That's being tracked as a page view event.\n\nBut it must be firing sometimes, as I have 28 events in GA4 confirming a booking is complete (/make-appointment/s/success), but 527 events reported for users clicking on the 'Confirm' button on /make-appointment/confirm (which triggers the enter code box to pop up).

(Set it up so that it triggers once per pageload, or otherwise).\n\nYou could solve this by changing the logic which automatically redirects them to the success page if the code is entered correctly. My idea here is that you force them to take an intermediary step before being sent to the /success page.\n\nI think the main issue is that the tracking is not at the very last step of the funnel, and many things behave unexpectedly there.",

The script would change from loading gtm.js from Google's domain to loading it from my own domain.\n\nHere's what the modified GTM script looks like:\n\n    javascriptCopy<!-- Google Tag Manager -->\n    <script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':\n    new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\n    j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=\n    'https://wp-demo.stape.dev/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);\n    })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXXX');</script>\n    <!-- End Google Tag Manager -->\n\nI'm hesitant to make this change because I'm concerned it might break all the marketing operations and tags currently running in our Web GTM. The custom domain I've set up is \"sst.okifinance.com\".\n\nHas anyone here implemented server-side tagging through Stape before?

Depending on what type of script you want to add you have to modify the javascript (remove script tags, add a few lines here and there...).\n\nThis is the documentation for implementing the GTM container and dataLayer events:\n\n[https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/pixels/custom-pixels/gtm-tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/pixels/custom-pixels/gtm-tutorial)\n\nI tried this two times on two different shops. While it was possible to add the GTM container in this way, I was just not successful with getting the dataLayer events implemented into the website even though I was exactly following the instructions.  \n\nWhat are your experiences with this whole issue? Does anybody have- or know of a code piece that I could add as a custom pixel that'll implement the GTM container and the whole e-ecommerce dataLayer? Would be greatly appreciated. In principal, I think it's great to have a possiblity of adding the e-comm. dataLayer without being dependent on a developer or buying an expensive plugin like Analyzify. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work as expected.\n\nThanks a lot and best regards!\n\n",

                "body": "What Shopify did actually makes a lot of sense, basically they don't allow you to run arbitrary scripts on the checkout page now which can undermine security and affect page performance. The problem is that currently most major platforms expose their functionality via a script you run on the page through GTM like Meta Ads, Google Ads, Google Analytics etc (basically all tags in GTM parlance) This will just stop working now. The sandbox alternative Shopify provides does not support all browser APIs so naturally even if you somehow manage to include GTM, a lot of tags would silently break. \n\nUnfortunately there is no complete solution on the client anymore for Google tag manager. You may be able to implement some tags but like I said, some functionality would silently break and a lot of tags would just not work anymore. \n\n The solution is to implement server side tracking and subscribe to important events like checkout, purchase etc on server side, then you can implement all the tags on server side to process these events. This is a bit more complex than the client side setup but it is (nearly) a 1 to 1 replacement with client side GTM setup. It also has the benefit to track important events which are not generated on website, for example order cancellations, refund etc. You could forward these events to Google Analytics 4 to get a complete picture of customer journey. \n\nHope this helps.",

If you add them both as-is they will work but this is not the recommended setup. Since you have an existing Google Tag on site all you really need to do is initialize the Google Ads tag. That would look something like this: \n\n```html\n<script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-96H5NXQXXX\"></script>\n<script>\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n  gtag('js', new Date());\n\n  gtag('config', 'G-96H5NXQXXX');\n  gtag('config', 'AW-11126366XXX');\n</script>\n```\n\nThe tag instructions on Google Ads even has an option that will give you a similar example as the above. The option should be something like \"I have an existing Google Tag\".",

However, I’ve noticed an issue where the tag is firing simply by clicking the button, even though I haven’t completed the form. It seems like the \"check validation\" feature in GTM isn’t functioning as expected.\n\nI’m wondering if there’s a way to track this issue. My first idea was to track the thank you page, but since it’s easily accessible, I tried using the “referrer” condition for the URL in the form submission and the page URL of the thank you page, but I’ve had no luck getting it to work correctly. Interestingly, other forms are still functioning as expected.",

It was working fine, until I had to implement consent.\n\nI created a Google Tag Manager container where I put a custom HTML tag from Sliktide (not relevant) and, after testing it in preview, it worked correctly. Then I was worried because I thought that the Google Tag I had linked to Ads and Analytics was sending data even though the user didn't consent, so I deleted that Google Tag and created one inside the container linked to my measurement id G-BLABLABLA that gets activated only when the user consents, but when I test it (by going, for example, on my website and doing some things, even with a VPN to be sue it doesn't get filtered) I don't get anything in Analytics.\n\nJust to be clear: on my website I only have my GTM-BLABLA tag installed, not any other ID.",

I want to ensure that consent choices from the CMP are properly passed to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) using Google Tag Manager (GTM), but right now, GA4 always shows consent as \"Refused\" by default, even when users accept cookies.\n\nBefore going any further, does the AdSense tool works for what I need (which is managing consent and track users on my website) ?\n\nHere is my setup:\nI’m using Google’s built-in CMP via AdSense (not a third-party CMP like OneTrust or Cookiebot).\n\nI haven’t manually added any scripts to my site—I want to handle everything through Google Tag Manager (GTM).\n\nI have enabled Consent Mode in GTM and activated Consent Overview in the container settings.\n\nI have no pre-existing GA4 tag in GTM.\n\nSo far:\nThe CMP is displaying correctly on my site and allows users to accept or reject cookies.\n\nHowever:\nEven after a user accepts cookies, Google Tag Assistant and GA4 DebugView still show:\n\nanalytics_storage: refused\nad_storage: refused\nOther consent categories also remain denied.\n\nThis suggests that GTM isn’t receiving updated consent signals from the CMP.\n\n\nQuestions:\nHow do I ensure that Google’s own CMP correctly updates GTM with the user’s consent choices?\n\nDoes Google AdSense’s CMP automatically send consent updates to GTM, or do I need to manually configure something?\n\nIs there a way to force GTM to listen for consent updates from Google’s CMP?\n\nAny insights or guidance would be greatly appreciated 🙏\n\nThanks !\n\n ",

A call to your CMP needs to be made at this point that needs to store your users settings (if they accepted cookies the settings should be over ridden to accepted).\n\n3.

But I just can't make it work.\n\nI’m planning to use server-side gtm setup with my custom domain to serve files, aka ~~first-party mode~~\\[edited\\] **First-party serving (same-site, cross-origin)**.\n\n***Ideal setup***\n\nMy ideal setup would look like:\n\n* ***wGTM***\n   * GTM is served via [https://my.domain.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-ABC](https://my.domain.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-ABC)\n   * GA4 is served via [https://my.domain.com/gtag/js?id=G-XYZ](https://my.domain.com/gtag/js?id=G-XYZ)\n* ***sGTM***\n   * Google Ads\n\nWhat I also tried:\n\n* ***wGTM***\n   * GTM is served via [https://my.domain.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-ABC](https://my.domain.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-ABC)\n   * GA4 is served via [https://my.domain.com/gtag/js?id=G-XYZ](https://my.domain.com/gtag/js?id=G-XYZ)\n   * Google Ads is served via [https://my.domain.com/gtag/js?id=AW-123](https://my.domain.com/gtag/js?id=AW-123)\n\nI tried these setups for Google Ads, and it's not working as I expect. Tag firing, tag success, but no requests emitted within server / browser.\n\n**However:** If I’m serving ALL the mentioned files from [googletagmanager.com](http://googletagmanager.com), everything seems to be working fine, and I see Google Ads Server ***Outgoing HTTP Requests from Browser***  requests to [doubleclick.net](http://doubleclick.net)\n\nSo these 2 setups are works fine\n\n***Setup 1***\n\n* wGTM\n   * GTM [https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-XYZ](https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-XYZ)\n   * GA4 [https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ABC](https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ABC)\n   * Google Ads [https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-123](https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-123)\n\n***Setup 2***\n\n* wGTM\n   * GTM [https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-XYZ](https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-XYZ)\n   * GA4 [https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ABC](https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ABC)\n* sGTM\n   * Google Ads\n\nBut I need my ideal setup to make it work.",

In the web container, we only have a GTag and GA4 events for each of the ecomm events we're tracking on the site.  There is no Meta Pixel tracking in the web container or on the website at all.\n\nThen in the server container we have a Facebook Conversion API tag to receive those GA4 events and connect them to Meta.\n\nHOWEVER - despite the fact there is no Pixel, and in the web container config we don't capture or pass the data in our GA4 server event tags at all, Meta is still receiving the \"fbp\" (browser ID) value and client IP address.\n\nIs there a way to remove those in GTM before passing to Meta?",

This is applying to all events.\n\nI've set up the tracking the same as I do all my other sites so I'm wondering if anyone knows a solution. Perhaps its something to do with how the website was built and I should speak to the dev? Please let me know.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/C09Hheq](https://imgur.com/a/C09Hheq)",

                "body": "I don't think I've ever audited GTM; rather, when starting a new job or freelance project, I've audited GA/GA4, and that typically cues a GTM \"clean up\" effort.\n\nIn GTM, there are best practices: use folders, stay organized, create new workspaces for specific efforts so that you can publish modularly, etc. Then, there are event and parameter naming conventions that directly impact GA reporting functionality (e.g., underscores for event names, hyphens for parameter names, consistent variable naming, e.g., 'DL - myCustomEvent'). It may include determining which tags are no longer in use, exporting their info, and then deleting legacy tags. There's of course testing tags to make sure their sending data, but much of that is done in the console.\n\nAfter that, there's auditing variables, tags, and triggers associated implementing Google Tag and E-commerce (e.g., What data are you sending with every GA4 event via the event settings variable? How many and which custom definitions are you sending with E-commerce events, and will that scale without running into problems associated with a limited number available?). Then, there's the holistic tracking strategy. As you're limited to 150 event-scoped custom definitions in browser-based GA4 360, how can you leverage reusable parameters (as existed in GA3 - Event Category, Action, Label) with GA4's new flexibility/capacity to include more/unique parameters? Which parameters only need to be available in queryable BigQuery raw exports? Are events pushed to the dataLayer? If so, are you leveraging reusable event tags for similar user interactions in GTM so that you don't have to create a new event tag/custom event trigger for every single event?\n\nSo, I guess beyond common sense workflows and adherence to simple technical specs, a GTM audit is, for me, pretty difficult to separate from an audit of the entire Analytics implementation. In a best case, that means looking all the way back to Measurement Planning, and usually includes current/future reporting needs. Oh, and how are you documenting GTM releases beyond GTMs version history? Confluence? Do people like developers, that don't need GTM access, need to be able to reference when and what was published?\n\nIf it's just a clean up effort (kind of laid out in the first paragraph), you may not need to hire anyone at all. It's ultimately pretty basic tidying, dotting i's, crossing t's, etc.\n\nIf it's a deep dive, there are lots of agencies that do that work. I've worked with AdSwerve, Bounteous, and at least one other I can't remember right now.\n\nIf it's all new, I'd caution against something like a \"checklist\" audit. Those can be useful tools, but it will absolutely pay in the long run to hire an agency or someone with significant experience. Getting things right and scalable early on can help avoid a lot of problems and work later. While most things can be hacked later on to keep the wheels on, big problems later on can lead to a lot of tech debt (hours and hours trying to fix or maintain historical reporting, fixing dashboards, etc.).",

Check via preview mode if you can identify your form submission with the history change or form events that are pushed to the dataLayer as mentioned before.\n\nAn other option could be using CSS selectors.

I would prefer to avoid magefan and do it myself. When I’m trying to set up the configuration I notice add to carts and checkouts initiated don’t fire in Google tag manager because they are form submission. I assume that’s why the Ajax listeners is used in the other container, and the amount of custom variables. But when I replicate the configuration it doesn’t fire, one reason I assume is because there is an old form submission listener in the 8y old container that’s not available anymore. \n\nI’ve spent 12 hours figuring out why and the only solution seems to be buy a paid extension/add-on, but I would really like to learn how to make it work manually. Anyone solved this problem before? ",

I have a few questions that I’d like some help with:\n\nLet’s say I have a client with a main website (maindomain.com) and a landing page for ads (subdomain lp.[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)). Would you recommend using a single GTM container in the same account for both the main website and the landing page?\n\nAre there any potential issues with duplicate tracking or counting? Would it be better to use permanent variables for both domains?\n\nIn my case, for ads, I plan to use different parameters to track where the lead came from in my CRM, for Google Ads and Meta specifically.\n\nI’ve seen some people set up separate GTM containers for their main website and landing page, even when the objectives are very similar. Is there a specific reason for this? \n\nI understand if it’s related to events that run for a limited time or other factors not directly connected to the lead generation goal, but when the sole objective is lead generation, why would someone use separate containers for the website and landing page?\n\nThanks!",

As Google migrated from UA to GA4, they auto-generated GA4 properties that are linked to the old UA script. Unless the client opted out of it, that's probably what they have. Have a chat with the client if they have any active GA4 properties for this domain. If they do, take a look if you can see that GA4 data stream ID firing in the network tab. If it's there, it's probably piggy-backing on the UA script. In which case you should first configure relevant GA4 pixels via GTM, before removing the UA script, in order to avoid temporary data loss. Ideally the hard-coded script removal and GTM workspace deployment should happen roughly at the same time.",

I also blog about this stuff if you need even more details. \n\nStep 1: In the Conversion settings page, find the \"Customer data terms\" section – make sure you’ve accepted these terms.\n\nStep 2: Turn on Enhanced Conversions for leads. In the same Conversions settings page, find the “Enhanced conversions for leads” section and check off ✅ “Turn on enhanced conversions for leads”. \n\nThen select your tracking method - eg. Google tag, Google Tag Manager, or Google Ads API *(if you use a server side tracker)*\n\nStep 3: Turn on Enhanced Conversions. There are two circumstances here. If you’ve already set up Enhanced Conversions, you are all good to go! You’ll know if you can see that Enhanced conversions is active tag.\n\nAlternatively, if you have NOT set up Enhanced Conversions, you will see \"Enhanced conversions has no recent data\". It means you will need to set this up from scratch. Fear not, I will walk you through it.\n\n  \nThere are 4 ways to set up EC:\n\n1. via Google Tag Manage**r** \\- If you’re already on GTM for conversion tracking, I recommend you stick to this and make some slight changes to your setup. [Google's support docs here](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13262500?utm_source=aimerce&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=my-10-min-guide-on-how-to-implement-enhanced-conversions) \n2. via Google tag - If you’ve set up [conversion tracking](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12216424?visit_id=638744916167193631-3149256661&rd=2&ref_topic=12215426&utm_source=aimerce&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=my-10-min-guide-on-how-to-implement-enhanced-conversions) on your site using , you can stick to this route and make some slight changes to your Google tag setup. [Google's support docs here](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7548399?utm_source=aimerce&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=my-10-min-guide-on-how-to-implement-enhanced-conversions) *(Note that Google tag needs to be directly set up on your page, not via a third-party tool or iFrame.)*  \n3. via Server side tracking - Once you’ve accepted the Customer data terms, turned on enhanced conversion, select “Google Ads API” as your method. Go to your server side tracking solution and connect your Google Ads account  - exact steps to this will probably differ solution to solution. \n4. via GA4 – Go to your GA4 Admin page, under the “Data collection and modification” section, click “Data collection”. Then find the “User-provided data collection” section, and click “Turn on”.  Note that after running side-by-side comparisons for hundreds of brands, this is the route I least recommend. I found that GA generally captured 20% less conversion actions than some of the other tools I ran experiments against. ",

I have a core configuration tag setup using the correct measurement Id & stream placed in my GTM container that is set to fire on all pages (successfully I might add) but I am not seeing any custom data (tags I made in GTM) in GA4, only the standard GA4 type events are showing up like click, scroll, user engagement, etc. . \n\nThe odd part is I can see all of the tags fire when I go into GTM tag assistant which leads me to the assumption that something is either wrong with the GTM code (I’ve confirmed with my dev team a few times that it’s place correctly) or more likely it’s an issue within GA4. I’ve tried the real time reports within GA4 and haven’t had much luck there either. This morning when I went into debug I could only see the google created events such as page view, scroll, etc. I’ve never seen anything like this before as typically when I create a tag with triggers in GTM, I am able to see it GA4’s Debug view, so I am extremely lost on what the issue could be and unfortunately I’ve never experienced anything like this and the research I’ve done has been generic or unhelpful.\n\nHas anyone ever encountered something like this and more importantly does anyone have any potential ideas on how to fix it?

Or having data sent directly from WP, without anything running on the front-end?\n\nThe \"standard\" method for GTM server-side on a website is still using the client-side for tracking. Basically, the \"website\" (usually some WP plugin) pushes events to the data layer, then GTM web is used to fire tags based on those events and sends them to GTM server. GTM server receives these events and then sends data to GA4, GAds, etc. (even back to the client, such as creating cookies).\n\nYou could entirely remove the client-side and just have your server (where WP is hosted) send data directly to GTM server. However, this is likely to lack plenty of data that you'd normally collect on the client side. In addition, this would require a lot more work for your dev team.\n\nI guess what's actually needed is more info on what are you looking to achieve as the end result.",

It is also a fall-back if other more reliable methods are not possible.\n\nSo short answer: No, it is not absolutely necessary to have a thank-you page to track conversions.\n\nThe ideal way is to use something called a Data Layer. A data layer is basically a JavaScript array that is a central communication hub between a website and marketing tools like Google Tag Manager.\n\nWhen a user interaction happens that needs tracking, an event is added (pushed) to the data layer (which is a JavaScript object with any details related to the event). GTM detects when things are added to the data layer and can then use it to fire tags (conversions and so on).\n\nSo if the user submits a form and the form emits an HTML event (this is different than a data layer event) that there is a successful form submission, a listener for the HTML event can be implemented that gets information from the form submission and adds it to the data layer, thus creating a data layer event. That data layer event can then be used by GTM to fire one or more conversion tags.\n\nSo yes, GTM handle conversions without needing a redirect to a new page.\n\nI start by first determining if a data layer is present. If not, I see if I can implement it. If not, I look to the next best way to track it, and so on.",

                "body": "## The Root Cause\n\nNextJS with App Router (13.4+) changed how scripts load. Your GTM implementation is likely using the old method that no longer works.\n\n## The Fix for NextJS App Router\n\n### Option 1: Using Next.js Script Component (Recommended)\n\nIn your `app/layout.tsx`:\n\n```javascript\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head />\n      <body>\n        {/* GTM Script with NextJS optimization */}\n        <Script\n          id=\"gtm-script\"\n          strategy=\"afterInteractive\"\n          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{\n            __html: `\n              (function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':\n              new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\n              j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=\n              'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);\n              })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXX');\n            `,\n          }}\n        />\n        \n        {/* GTM noscript */}\n        <noscript>\n          <iframe\n            src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXX\"\n            height=\"0\"\n            width=\"0\"\n            style={{ display: 'none', visibility: 'hidden' }}\n          />\n        </noscript>\n        \n        {children}\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: For Pages Router\n\nIn `_app.tsx`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Handle route changes for GTM\n    const handleRouteChange = (url) => {\n      window.dataLayer?.push({\n        event: 'pageview',\n        page: url,\n      })\n    }\n    \n    router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', handleRouteChange)\n    return () => {\n      router.events.off('routeChangeComplete', handleRouteChange)\n    }\n  }, [router.events])\n  \n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        id=\"gtm-script\"\n        strategy=\"afterInteractive\"\n        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{\n          __html: `\n            (function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':\n            new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\n            j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=\n            'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);\n            })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXX');\n          `,\n        }}\n      />\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Option 3: Using @next/third-parties (Newest Method)\n\nGoogle now recommends their official package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @next/third-parties\n```\n\nThen in your layout or app:\n\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleTagManager } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <GoogleTagManager gtmId=\"GTM-XXXXXX\" />\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Why It Broke \"Recently\"\n\n1. **Next.js 13.4+ App Router** changed script loading behavior\n2. **React 18 Strict Mode** in development can double-fire or block GTM\n3. **Google's changes** to how GTM validates container installation\n\n## Immediate Fix\n\nIf you need tracking working NOW while you implement the proper fix:\n\n1. Temporarily disable React Strict Mode in `next.config.js`:\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  reactStrictMode: false, // Temporary for debugging\n}\n```\n\n2. Clear your `.next` cache: `rm -rf .next`\n3. Rebuild: `npm run build`\n\n## Validation\n\nAfter implementing:\n- GTM Preview should show \"Connected\"\n- Analytics should receive data within 30 seconds\n- No console errors about GTM initialization\n\nThis is a critical infrastructure issue that typically takes 2-4 hours to properly fix and test across all your NextJS/React apps. The key is using Next.js's Script component with the correct strategy.",

When GTM Preview says \"no tag installed\" despite your implementation, it means the container isn't initializing properly. This is especially common with NextJS due to its hybrid rendering approach.\n\n## The NextJS/React GTM Problem\n\nThe \"recent changes\" you mentioned likely refer to Google's updated GTM snippet requirements for SPAs. NextJS apps need special handling because:\n- Server-side rendering (SSR) vs client-side hydration timing\n- React's strict mode in development can break GTM\n- App Router vs Pages Router have different integration points\n\n## Quick Diagnostic\n\nRun this in your browser console on any page:\n\n```javascript\n// Check GTM initialization in NextJS\n(() => {\n  const checks = {\n    gtmScript: !!document.querySelector('script[src*=\"googletagmanager.com\"]'),\n    dataLayer: typeof dataLayer !== 'undefined',\n    gtmObject: typeof google_tag_manager !== 'undefined',\n    containerId: window.dataLayer?.find(item => item['gtm.start'])?.['gtm.uniqueEventId'],\n    reactRoot: !!document.getElementById('__next'),\n    hydrated: !!window.__NEXT_DATA__\n  };\n  \n  console.table(checks);\n  \n  if (!checks.gtmObject && checks.gtmScript) {\n    console.error('GTM script loaded but not initialized - typical NextJS timing issue');\n  }\n  \n  // Check if GTM is being blocked\n  const blockedResources = performance.getEntriesByType('resource')\n    .filter(r => r.name.includes('googletagmanager') && r.transferSize === 0);\n  \n  if (blockedResources.length > 0) {\n    console.error('GTM requests blocked:', blockedResources);\n  }\n  \n  return 'See console for GTM initialization status';\n})();\n```",

If not, the traffic will show in GA4 as direct.\n\nA really robust tracking template can make a huge difference, as can server side tracking outside of the Facebook App that Shopify has, I never use that, I have a solution that is more reliable for advertisers I work with and we always know which channel, which campaign, which ad set, which ad produced the conversions, even if Meta doesn't.\n\nHope that helps, sorry it's a lengthy reply.

        "author": "Hopperkuh",
        "id": "1mo8bmh",
        "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI recently started running Google Ads on my Shopify store, but I’m still stuck on the conversion tracking for actions like “Add to Cart” or “Purchase.” The problem is that even though I manually trigger these conversions, I’m not receiving the data in Google Ads. Both Shopify and Google Support tell me the connections are set up correctly, but they are obviously not — this is driving me insane, so please have a look at my problem.\n\n**How do I know the setup is not correct?**\n\n1. I manually triggered all the conversions multiple times (e.g., by buying a product) and waited more than 7 days for them to appear.\n2. Google Tag Manager shows the tag firing.\n3. Tag Assistant also recognizes the tag.\n\nI think the issue is that I have multiple tags. When I check Google Tag Manager, I can see two GT tags active. When I look at the Tag Coverage, I find:\n\n* **GT-XXXXXX2JM** → appears on \\~485 URLs (main tag, including checkout and thank-you pages).\n* **GT-XXXXXXNDP** → appears on \\~63 URLs.\n* Some pages are not tagged at all.\n* Some pages have two tags firing simultaneously.\n\nThis is already very confusing. I’m not sure which of these should be the main tag and which is secondary. When I looked at Google Ads and GA4, I found the GT-XXXXXX2JM tag, so I assumed this must be the main tag. After discussing with the Google Support AI, we identified the other tag might come from the Google Merchant Center. I deleted and reinstalled the Merchant Center account as instructed in shopify\n\nThen something strange happened — I received from Merchant Center a completely new tag, **GT-XXXXXSHV**, which is now tagged to 7 URLs (landing page, checkout, and cart). The tag I had deleted from Shopify by removing the Merchant Center account is still active on its URLs — total chaos.\n\nMy suspicion is that the tag I always thought was my primary one (GT-XXXXXX2JM) was never actually recognized as the primary tag in Shopify. For example, in Google Ads and GA4 I see this warning:  \n“Unsupported tag implementation detected in Shopify. The Google tag is running in a custom Shopify pixel. This may result in double counting with your Google tag configured in the Google & YouTube app on your Shopify website.”\n\nWhen I first set up conversion tracking, I started with a manual tag — maybe this is where the issue comes from. But that manual tag was deleted a long time ago (including cache, etc.), and now I’m only using the connection provided by the Google & YouTube app for simplicity.\n\n**My question:**  \nHow can I solve this tag chaos? Is it possible to merge the tags? So far I haven’t found any way to delete a tag — I only see the option to merge, which also seems risky to me. I’d like to have a clean setup with just one GT tag.\n\nI really appreciate any help here!",

In Shopify every Google feature and META (Search Console, Analytics, Google Ads) are linked as of now.\n\nTo my understanding and experience, adding a GTM container to the website and add the tags for each platform, for instance the META config, Google Ads tag and the appropriate conversion events. This manual set-up gives greater flexibility and more control, analysis capabilities and reporting.  \n  \nHowever, they insist on using the connections made by Shopify with these tools. I do think a new environment with a solid set-up helps them in the future.  \n  \nWhat is your take / experience on this and how to tackle such an issue?",

First, ensure that your trigger uses \"All Clicks\" or \"Just Links\" appropriately and that your CSS selector is broad enough to consistently match all intended elements. Also, consider enabling GTM’s built-in variables like \"Click Classes,\" \"Click ID,\" and \"Click Text\" to debug whether the correct values are being captured each time. If the elements are dynamically inserted, try using a delay or a DOM-ready check, or switch to a more stable event (e.g., a custom event triggered after the element fully loads). Lastly, inspect whether any other scripts or navigation actions (like page reloads or JavaScript redirects) are interrupting GTM’s ability to complete the tag fire before the page unloads.",

Here's a summary of my setup and the problem:\n\nMy GA4 config tag has built-in consent checks and triggers on 'Initialization - All Pages'.\n\nThe CookieYes configuration tag in GTM has default consent settings set to 'disabled' and triggers on 'Consent Initialization - All Pages'.\n\nThe Problem:\nIn Google DebugView, I see that CookieYes sends an automatic cookie consent update to GTM. After the user interacts with the cookie banner, a second consent update is sent. This seems to cause GA4 to incorrectly classify over 90% of traffic as 'Direct', which is obviously not correct.\n\nPreviously, with other CMPs, I triggered the GA4 tag on 'cookie consent update' and it worked with a single event when the user actually updated their consent.\n\nCould anyone provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the GA4 tag and the CookieYes tag to work together properly? I need to troubleshoot this to ensure accurate traffic attribution.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

CookieYes sends an initial consent state (defaulted to “denied”) and then updates it once the user interacts with the banner. So GA4 respects that and adjusts accordingly.\n\nNow here’s where the issue comes in:\n\nOn first page load, GA4 fires but sees consent as “denied,” so it doesn’t collect identifiable data. UTM parameters like source/medium/campaign do appear in DebugView, which tells me they’re being passed but they don’t carry over into real-time or standard reports unless the user accepts cookies and then refreshes or navigates to another page.\n\nThis seems to be because UTM data is only available via document.location and document.referrer on the first page load. If the user consents after that first load, and GA4 only starts collecting data then, the original attribution context is gone so the session is marked as Direct.\n\nSo it’s not that GA4 is blocked from firing it’s that it fires before consent is granted, and once consent is updated, GA4 starts collecting but by then the attribution info has already been lost.\n\nSession counts seem fine, it’s just that the quality of attribution is poor unless the user refreshes or navigates after accepting. It’s a timing issue, really.\n\nAnd yes, defaulting to “denied” is required to stay GDPR-compliant for first-time users.",

ITotally agree with you ChatGPT can be useful, but it definitely has a habit of confidently suggesting overcomplicated solutions, especially when you’re trying to debug consent or tagging issues.\n\nFor example, in my case, ChatGPT suggested I disable the default page view by setting send_page_view: false in the GA4 config tag. Then, I was supposed to create a separate GA4 page_view event tag that would only trigger when analytics_storage = granted, using a custom event like cookie_consent_update and a Data Layer Variable {{dlv - analytics consent}} set to granted.\n\nIn theory, that would delay the page view until after consent and preserve UTM parameters but the issue was that CookieYes wasn’t pushing any analytics_storage consent updates into the Data Layer. The DataLayer variable just stayed \"undefined\" even after users accepted cookies. So the trigger never fired, and no page_view was sent at all.\n\nWhat’s strange is that I couldsee in GTM's Consent tab that the consent status was updated to \"granted\", but since CookieYes was handling it internally and not pushing that to the Data Layer, it broke ChatGPT’s whole approach.\n\nSo yeah, I’m struggling a bit here. I’ve spent hours trying to get UTM parameters to persist correctly. I can see in GTM Debug Mode that the initial page view is being sent before consent is granted, and I’m pretty sure that’s where the UTM data is captured and lost.\n\nOnly after users accept cookies and navigate to another page does a new page view get triggered and that shows up as the first page view in GA4’s DebugView, which confirms that attribution is getting lost right at the start.\n\nCan anyone confirm if that’s likely the root cause? And if so, what’s the best way to solve it?\n\nReally appreciate any insight this one's been driving me mad for days!!",

They’re missing completely even though I understand they should be auto-handled by GA4.\n\nThis is also why they’re not showing up in my real-time reports under Page view → Source / Medium / Campaign, and why I’m getting 90+% Direct traffic in reports. So it seems like GA4 isn’t picking them up at all.\n\nThe strange part: if a user accepts cookies and then hard-refreshes the page, then the UTM parameters appear in DebugView and Real-Time  so that seems to be the key moment where the UTM data actually gets captured and passed through.\n\nSo it looks like the initial page view is happening before consent is granted, and GA4 is either not allowed to collect attribution info at that point or isn’t persisting it and then by the time consent is granted, the UTM data is already lost from the URL.\n\nAny idea why that’s happening?

That means GA4 doesn't capture source/medium data unless consent is given, so traffic that *should* be attributed ends up labelled as ‘Direct’.\n\nTo address this:\n\n* **Google’s Advanced Consent Mode V2** can help. It allows tags to send cookieless pings *before* consent is given. These are used by Google to model user behaviour but aren’t shown in your actual GA4 reports, they just help fill in the gaps.  \n* Full tracking only kicks in once the user accepts analytics cookies. If most visitors don't consent, GA4 ends up labeling a big chunk of traffic as 'Direct'.\n\n\n\nEven with these features in place, you may still see major gaps in reported traffic if users don’t accept tracking cookies. To stay GDPR compliant, analytics tools must respect user consent, so you can’t collect complete tracking data without explicit permission.\n\nRefer: [https://www.cookieyes.com/documentation/drop-in-traffic-on-google-analytics-after-adding-cookieyes/](https://www.cookieyes.com/documentation/drop-in-traffic-on-google-analytics-after-adding-cookieyes/)\n\nIf you need help troubleshooting your setup or setting the tag behavior correctly, feel free to email us at [support@cookieyes.com](mailto:support@cookieyes.com).",

        "author": "Magefan_User",
        "id": "1lweebc",
        "selftext": "We're seeing plenty of peope confused now that the Google Tag Gateway feature's been introduced.  So've decided to shed some light on this feature to break any false definitions and give people clear understanding of what is Google Tag Gateway, how it works and why you need it.\n\nSo, if you’re working with Google Tag Manager web container, you may notice that tracking is getting less reliable. That's because  to ad blockers, browser privacy features (like ITP) become more sophisticated these  days. They treat the GTM script as third-party, which it is, since it loads from Google domain.\n\nSo the **Google Tag Gateway** feature fixes that without barely any changes to your current web container setup (not tags or triggers).\n\nLet's see how it works.\n\n# What is Google Tag Gateway?\n\nIn a standard GTM setup, your tags are loaded from [googletagmanager.com](http://googletagmanager.com), and tracking requests are sent to Google-owned domains. That’s why most privacy tools and ad blockers block them, leaving you with inaccurate data.\n\n**Google Tag Gateway changes this**: it reroutes all tag-related requests (from GTM, GA4, Google Ads) through your domain — e.g. `yourstore.com/tracking`. So from the browser’s and user's perspective, everything comes from your website, as first-party.\n\n# How It Works?\n\nBasically, everything works as usually with the web container, the only difference is - when you use Google Tag Gateway it routes the requests from [googletagmaager.com](http://googletagmaager.com) from the custom tracking path you set up.\n\nThe browser sees those requests as first-party, so they aren't flagged or blocked.\n\nImpressive right?\n\nThe best part yet is that you don't need to change anything in your current tag setup, setup a separate container (yet again) or configure server-side tagging.\n\nAll you need is to connect Cloudflare to your GTM, GA4 or Google Ads (spending on the channel you use for tracking) and that's it.\n\n**More details + setup instructions here**: [https://magefan.com/blog/google-tag-gateway](https://magefan.com/blog/google-tag-gateway)",

When I try to remove a listed “destination”, the only option here is: To remove a destination, you must assign it to another Google tag??????\n\nI also attempted to delete this tag totally, but can’t find an option to do that either.\n\nI deleted the GA4 property associated with this tag and created a new one and did not link it to the Google Ads account, but that didn’t help\n\nFor the most part this update has only impacted the Google Tags associated with Google Ads, however I do see the “No Google Tag Found” error in SOME of the Containers where the Google Tags associated with GA4 Analytics Measurement ID. I believe this is just a phony error message as there IS a Google tag there and seems to be tracking correctly on those.\n\nAfter 3 days, I’m ready to pull out what remaining hairs I have left on my head….Any suggestions, guidance, thoughts or ideas appreciated. \n\n",

                "body": "Imagine your website is a physical store. Google Tag Manager (GTM) is like an advanced \"camera system\" that observes visitors when they enter your store and notifies your \"partners\" (such as Google Analytics, Google Ads, or Meta) about what those visitors do.\n\nFor example, GTM can simply notify when a visitor arrives or provide more detailed insights, like tracking the areas they visit, the products they view, the items in their cart, or whether they complete a purchase or submit a form.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that GTM itself does **not analyze the data**. Instead, it enables the tools you connect to it—like Google Analytics or Facebook Ads Manager—to perform the analysis and give you insights. Think of GTM as the messenger, not the decision-maker.\n\nThe great part? Instead of installing a separate system for each of your partners, you install one GTM system and configure it to notify all your tools as needed.\n\n**How GTM Works:**\n\n* **Tags**: Tags are the connections between GTM and your partners. Each tag sends specific information (like clicks, purchases, or video plays) to tools like Google Analytics or Meta Ads.\n* **Triggers**: Triggers are the actions you want to monitor, such as a visitor clicking a button, submitting a form, or scrolling down a page.\n* **Variables**: Variables are like reusable templates or placeholders for information. For example, you can store your Google Analytics ID in a variable and reference it across multiple tags. If the ID changes, you only need to update the variable once, and all related tags will update automatically.\n\nTo set it up, you install a JavaScript tag on your website. Then, by configuring triggers, tags, and variables, you can track visitor behavior and share that data with the tools you use to analyze it.",

For example, a tag can track how many people clicked a button on your site.\n\t2.\tWhat does GTM do?\nInstead of adding all these code snippets (tags) manually to your website, you install GTM once. Then, you use the GTM interface to add, update, or manage your tags. No need to touch your website’s code again for each new tag.\n\t3.\tHow does it work?\n\t•\tContainer: GTM creates a “container” (a single piece of code) that you place on your website or app.\n\t•\tTriggers: You set up rules for when a tag should “fire” (e.g., when someone visits a page, clicks a button, or submits a form).\n\t•\tVariables: You can define extra information (like URLs or user data) to make your tags more specific.\n\t4.\tBenefits:\n\t•\tSaves time: You don’t need a developer for every small tag change.\n\t•\tFlexibility: Add or remove tags easily through the GTM interface.\n\t•\tOrganization: Keeps all your tracking codes in one place.\n\t5.\tWho should use it?\n\t•\tWebsite owners or marketers who need to track user behavior.\n\t•\tAnyone running ad campaigns and wants precise data for optimization.\n\nIn short, GTM acts as a middleman between your website and analytics/marketing tools, making it easier to track and manage everything.",

Starting April 10, 2025, containers with Google Ads and Floodlight tags will automatically load a Google tag first, before sending events.\n\nAll of my GTM containers already have a Google Tag firing on trigger \"Initialization - All Pages\". No other tags fire before that except for default consent settings at \"Consent Initialization - All Pages\".\n\nIs this yet another incorrect, misleading and ultimately useless notification from Google?\n\nI would ask them directly, but the email is from a no-reply address and despite the reassurance that I can \"contact them any time about this change\" there apparently isn't a route to do so.\n\nEdit: It turns out what they mean is I should add a Google Tag for Ads, as well as the one I have for GA4. No idea where they got that number of containers from though - I must have about 3 that use Ads. Also, even after adding the suggested tag it's still prompting me to create the same missing tag.",

I have some experience in GTM, and I have set up conversion tracking for clients multiple times, but I've hit a wall with this one.\n\nSo one of our clients has Google Tag Manager installed on their website via their web developer/branding agency. The quality of the container is excellent, and everything seemed great. However now we face the issue that none of the engagement is getting tracked by Google Tag Manager. What I mean by that is that none of the clicks are even being recorded, no click url's, click text or whatever is getting tracked. No information is being shown, which makes it pretty impossible for us to set up conversion tracking.\n\n  \nDoes anyone recognize this issue? I have no idea how to fix this. We've installed cookies so that's not the issue. \n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm having a problem setting up advanced e-commerce tracking on a Shopify site using Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4).\n\n\n\n**Description of the problem:**\n\n**Missing events**: When I use GTM's preview mode to test my implementation, I find that when adding a product to the cart, specific events such as add\\_to\\_cart or view\\_item are not fired. Instead, only the form\\_start and form\\_submit events appear. I don't have any events related to ‘item’ or the expected e-commerce tracking.\n\n**Intermittent loading of the GTM container:** In addition, I've noticed that when browsing the site during preview, the GTM-XXXXX container sometimes loads and sometimes doesn't, even when remaining on the same home page. This inconsistency makes diagnosis even more difficult.\n\n\n\n**What I've already checked:**\n\n**Presence of GTM code:** The GTM container code is present on all pages, placed immediately at the end of the <head> tag in the theme.liquid file.\n\n**Cache and extensions:** I've cleared my browser's cache, tested in private browsing mode, and disabled any extensions that might block scripts (such as ad blockers), but the problem persists.\n\n**Cookie Consent:** There is no cookie consent banner or CMP that could prevent the GTM from loading.\n\n\n\n**Additional information:**\n\n**Shopify Theme**: The site uses a custom theme. I have not made any recent changes to the theme that would explain this behaviour.\n\n**Third-party applications**: No third-party applications or scripts have been added or modified recently.\n\n**Other working site:** On another Shopify site I manage with a similar configuration, e-commerce tracking is working correctly, including add\\_to\\_cart and view\\_item events.\n\n\n\n**My questions :**\n\n**Missing e-commerce events:** Why are specific e-commerce events such as add\\_to\\_cart or view\\_item not being triggered when the corresponding actions are taken on the site?Do I have to manually configure the data layer for these events on Shopify? If so, how do I go about this?\n\n**Intermittent GTM loading:** What could be causing the GTM container to load randomly, even on the same page? Are there any specific settings to check or known Shopify issues that could explain this behaviour?\n\n\n\nI would be very grateful for any help or advice you could provide. Thank you in advance for your time and expertise!",

I advertise globally.  Originally, what I tried to do was only display my consent banner for EU & UK, and not display it for the rest of the world.  The problem with this is, because \"Default Consent (Global)\" is being set to \"Denied\" in GTM, it doesn't seem to give customers outside the EU & UK a chance to accept the cookies (because the consent banner doesn't come up) and there is a loss of conversions being counted in Google Ads for customers outside the EU & UK. \n\nNow when I asked the CMP Partner of the consent banner I am currently using on what configuration I should use in GTM, the CMP Partner told me that I should set \"Default Consent (Global)\" to \"Granted\" and then in \"Default Consent (Region-specific),\" I should add UK and add each country in the EU and set them to \"Denied.\"  I then asked Google Ads support about this, and they contradicted the CMP Partner and said \"Default Consent (Global)\" should be set to \"Denied\" in GTM.  Mind you, I think I am in the lowest tier of support for Google Ads and at times, it seemed like the staff I was interacting with were not trained well.\n\nFast forward two months later, I am considering using a completely different consent banner with a completely different CMP Partner, that also offers the option to bring up the consent banner only for EU & UK customers.  When I asked this second CMP Partner what the GTM configuration should be if I only show their consent banner to EU & UK customers, they said the same thing as my current CMP Partner and repeated the same GTM settings! \n\nThat's two different CMP Partners, who recommend if you only display their banner in the EU & UK, to set set \"Default Consent (Global)\" to \"Granted\" and then in \"Default Consent (Region-specific),\" I should add UK and add each country in the EU and set them to \"Denied.\"  Ergo, that is two different CMP Partners who are recommending the settings I make in GTM, go against what Google Ads support is saying.\n\nWhat I care about is whether my Google Ads account gets banned, if I follow the two CMP Partner instructions as outlined above, since it goes against the Google Ads support instructions. So my question is,  does Google Ads audit or check your GTM settings?  Or is GTM firewalled and Google Ads will never check my GTM settings?",

Not as neat, but it works.\n\nSo.... the point is it's possible to set the defailt consent differently based on geolocation. In your case, I would set all consent to granted by default but also define the list of regions where consent is denied by default. You can likely easily find the list of 2 letter country codes.

In the end, all that matters is that the EU and the UK do have default consent set to denied so you’re compliant.\n\nLike a month ago I got a message from Google that my cookie notice didn’t meet there requirements and I had to change it within like 90 days or they are allowed to stop the partnership. They can’t give legal advice so they don’t say what’s actually wrong and they had to recheck like 30 times before they chose to just tell me what I had to change 😂 I think they where truly done with me hahah. So, no they won’t ban you so easily. They would contact you, give you plenty of time to change it, and they will recheck as many times as needed until your compliant.

I have Google Tag manager installed in a client's point-of-sale (POS) system. At the beginning of November last year our code was removed from the site. The POS vendor doesn't keep logs in the admin portal and the client has no clue how it was removed. Unfortunately this means POS conversions were lost for November and part of December, a period of heavy conversions given Cyber Monday and Black Friday sales. This isn't the first time something like this has happened. Earlier in the year I had conversions tracking and then they rolled out an update that changed all the variables being used and didn't tell us so we lost February and March conversions and couldn't get back up and running for a few months because I had no idea what the variables were and the help docs were behind a login portal I didn't have access to. Not a huge fan of this vendor.\n\nI have no control over their POS vendor. So, I signed up for email notifications from the POS vendor for when they do updates so I can check to make sure our code is still there and functioning but it required me to go in and check manually and to remember to check amidst my other duties. Which is why I'm wondering if there's a away to automate that checking for me?",

The tracking works fine in the iframe and redirects, but when the user reaches the thank you page, GTM isn’t detecting the page view, and the tag doesn't fire.\n\n* The /thankyou/ page works fine when I go to it directly, and the tag fires correctly.\n* However, when the process runs through the iframe and redirects to the thank you page, Tag Assistant shows everything up to the final booing but doesnt show the /thankyou/ page\n* On top of that Tag Assistance then loses connection with the preview page (which in now on /thankyou/) and then show a “Can’t connect to the website” with the option to Reload (but reload restarts the preview page and takes it back to home)\n\n# What I've Tried:\n\n* Cross-domain tracking between the main domain and subdomain is set up and works for most steps.\n* I’m aware this could be an iframe or session tracking issue, but I’m not sure how to fix it.\n* Or it could be a GA4 issue - as its a bit of a mess over there.\n* 0Tested everything in GTM Preview mode, and the issue only happens when the user is redirected from the iframe.\n\n# Looking for Advice:\n\nAnyone got any idea how to get this working?\n\nFYI its for Google Ads tracking and the /thankyou/ page is the ultimate conversion so I cant really start ads until I can track that process.\n\nEdit:  \nGoddamit!!! So the problem was in the final redirect. GTM was watching for a redirect to [https://www.businesssite.com/thankyou/](https://www.businesssite.com/thankyou/)  \nBut in my infinite brilliance I forgot to add the **s** in http**s**:// so the redirect was going to http:// and GTM was losing the tracking.  \nAdd the s back to https and everything working again.\n\nBut thankyou everyone for your comments.

        "selftext": "Hi there\n\nI am having issues after installing server-side TikTok Events API with Google Tag Manager. After installing the events/Conversions in Ga4 are gone so they are not being sent to GA4. \n\nStrange thing is that when I go in GTM preview mode it still fires all the tags I once implemented for GA4. But somehow they are missing in GA4. \n\nAlso strange is that my Meta Pixel and TikTok Pixel seem to work so in their Events Manager I can see those conversions and events. \n\nOther thing I noticed is that somehow the events \"gtm.init\" and \"gtm.init\\_consent\" started to show in GA4 since the day it stopped working. In GTM preview mode it also looks like those events where somehow triggered by the automatically installed TikTok Tags.\n\nI then checked if there are some consent modes that have been activated with this implementation - but that doesn't seem to be the case. Container settings don't have any consent modes activated.\n\nTo be honest I am super clueless and I know it's very hard from an outside perspective to help me here - I am also trying with TikTok support (so far so bad) - but maybe anyone out here had the same or similar issue and figured out a way or a solution??\n\nThank you so much for your help in advance!",

Since TikTok and Meta Pixels work, it could be a GA4 tag setup issue. Check if server-side tags are conflicting with GA4 or if any consent settings are blocking data. Try ensuring that GA4 tags are set up properly.

                "body": "The match rate issue is likely due to missing fbp (browser ID) and fbc (click ID) parameters. Here's how to fix it:\n\nFor web implementations:\n\n* You need to grab both \\_fbp and \\_fbc cookies from the client browser\n* Also check URL parameters for fbclid (this gets stored as \\_fbc cookie when users click FB ads)\n* Use GTM's built-in variables or custom JS to extract these values\n\nKey implementation steps:\n\n1. Create custom JavaScript variables in GTM to read these cookies\n2. Pass them as parameters in your Conversions API setup\n3. Ensure proper event\\_id propagation between browser events and server events (crucial for deduplication)\n\nI'd recommend mapping out their entire funnel first to understand exactly which events need to be fired at which stages. This helps ensure consistent tracking across both pixel and CAPI.\n\nSometimes it's easier to rebuild than fix. If their existing implementation is a mess, consider starting fresh with a proper implementation rather than trying to patch the current one.\n\nFeel free to share more details about their setup if you need more specific guidance.",

That website has a completely different URL and seems to be a booking software that the button is linked to.\n\nNow I know that i can track the buttons on the ACTUAL website easily.

I suppose I would need to have that pushed as it's own unique DLV (or something similar) that picks up the either or that takes place, and then use that in the user provided data section of the tag.\n\n  \nI really appreciate you taking the time to put this together. The only issue is that the reason I am trying this out is I am trying to consolidate two conversion tags into one. Dev was looking for ways to have us reduce tag load so I was just playing around with some ways to consolidate without compromising data quality to our ads platform.

        "selftext": "I am working with the web developer to set up Google Tag Manager across two different sites. I wanted to install Tag Manager so that we could potentially use it to install javascript for other analytics platforms apart from Google. \n\nFor the first site, my colleague just went through the steps of setting up the Google Tag; she went and made a new property for the site, got the Google Tag ID, and gave it to the web dev who installed it through Duda's CMS/backend. I went and made a Google Tag Manager Container, gave him the GTM ID and the script/noscript code, all of which he installed. However, I can only see the Google Tag as being active when I look in the Tag Assistant. The data is still flowing through to the Google Analytics property, but for the life of me I can't figure out why the Tag Manager won't work. \n\nFor the second site, I set this up by creating a new property and data stream, but I didn't have the dev add the Google Tag first. Instead I made a container for Tag Manager and I then gave the GTM ID and the code to the dev who installed it. Then, I created a tag in Tag Manager using the data stream Google ID and sent that to a new live version through the container. Everything seems to work fine - the data stream has data, and in Tag Assistant I can see both tags are firing. \n\nI don't know enough about all of this to know if the way the first site was set up (by adding the Google Tag first) has something to do with why this isn't working. Maybe it won't let Tag Manager work if it detects an existing Google Tag? We've gone through the code for each page on the first site and ensured that the GTM tag ID is indeed present on each page, and it even says that it has been detected on 8 of 8 pages in the Tag Coverage tab. But in Tag Manager, I have an \"Urgent\" warning saying that it \"stopped sending data\" and hasn't received data in over 48 hours, and that it the tag is missing on some pages. \n\nSo I'm kind of at a loss here. Any help would be much appreciated! \n\n",

                "body": "Okay so, I took a quick peek and I see the following:\n\n# 1.)\n\nThe container is definitely loading and I can see that it is registered by Tag Assistant as well. Although, since I don't have access to the container I cannot see the events that it is processing. Instead I have to look at the \\`dataLayer\\` array to check what is being pushed.\n\n# 2.)\n\nChecking the \\`dataLayer\\` shows two events named \\`\"gtm.js\"\\` (Container Loaded). As there should never be two of these I checked where the second one was coming from and it seems like the developer has implemented the container code twice, using two different methods.\n\n**Method 1:**\n\nThis is a modified version of the original container code. Either the dev modified it themselves or they're using a plugin of sorts that outputs this code.\n\n    <script>\n      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n      window.dataLayer.push({\n        'gtm.start': new Date().getTime(),\n        event: 'gtm.js'\n      });\n    </script>\n    <script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-NZB78TCN\" id=\"d-js-gtm\" onload=\"window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('gtmLoaded', { bubbles: true }))\"></script>\n\n**Method 2:**\n\nThe original unmodified container code.\n\n    <script>\n      (function (w, d, s, l, i) {\n        w[l] = w[l] || [];\n        w[l].push({\n          'gtm.start': new Date().getTime(),\n          event: 'gtm.js',\n        });\n        var f = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\n          j = d.createElement(s),\n          dl = l != 'dataLayer' ? '&l=' + l : '';\n        j.async = true;\n        j.src = 'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=' + i + dl;\n        f.parentNode.insertBefore(j, f);\n      })(window, document, 'script', 'dataLayer', 'GTM-NZB78TCN');\n    </script>\n    <noscript>\n      <iframe src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-NZB78TCN\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" style=\"display: none; visibility: hidden\"></iframe>\n    </noscript>\n\n\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n* The container is indeed being loaded, twice!\n* One of the container implementations need to be removed as having duplicates of the Container Loaded event will definitely cause issues.\n* Assuming you have access to the GTM container you should be able to see it Tag Assistant and/or Preview mode.\n* If you don't have access then that is the reason why you are unable to debug the container using Tag Assistant.",

If you want to do Tag Manager, I'm pretty sure you still have to put the script on the site. Then, you go through and make the tag and trigger like you mentioned, and when you preview the site with Tag Assistant, you'll see that the Tag Manager is active, and that the Google Tag is sourced from the container. That's what the second site looks like. The container source is \"on-page gtm.js snippet\" and the source for the GTag is that container.\n\nWhen I go into Tag Assistant on the first site, I only see the Google tag - that Tag Manager tag says that it isn't detected.

When I asked him to go with Tag Manager instead, I guess he assumed that it would replace what had been done, but I'm not sure that it did. I don't know enough about the HTML to look at the site and see if it is incorrect. I see the correct tag IDs for the container and the Gtag (the Gtag would be the same whether it was installed individually or through a container I think), but beyond that I'm at a loss.\n\nThere is an option (I can't remember where right now) that says \"Ignore duplicate on-page configuration\" which is turned on. Do you think that could prevent the GTM from working if the on-page gtag config preceded it?\n\nEither way, sounds like we just need to scrub it and start over I think.

                "body": "I appreciate all your help. With the tips provided and asking the right questions to ChatGPT, I came up with a solution that I will leave below: a step-by-step guide on how to track an iframe button click.\n\n  \nSOLUTION PART 1\n\n**Step 1: Code Injection in the Iframe Source Domain**  \nIf you have access to the iframe's source domain, you can inject code to track the \"Book Now\" button click and communicate this event to the parent page via `postMessage`. Below is the code you should insert:\n\n**In the** `<body>` **of the iframe:**  \nInject the following code into the `<body>` of the iframe's source page:\n\n    htmlCopy code<script>\n      // Add a listener for the click on the \"Book Now\" button\n      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n        var bookNowButton = document.querySelector('#bookNow');\n        \n        if (bookNowButton) {\n          bookNowButton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n            // Send a message to the parent page indicating that the button was clicked\n            window.parent.postMessage('bookNowClicked', '*'); \n          });\n        }\n      });\n    </script>\n    \n\n**Explanation of the Code:**\n\n* `DOMContentLoaded`: Ensures the script runs as soon as the DOM is fully loaded and the button is available.\n* `document.querySelector('#bookNow')`: Selects the \"Book Now\" button by its ID.\n* `bookNowButton.addEventListener('click', ...)`: Adds a listener for clicks on the \"Book Now\" button.\n* `window.parent.postMessage('bookNowClicked', '*')`: When the button is clicked, sends a message to the parent page (where the iframe is embedded), notifying that the button was clicked. The argument `'bookNowClicked'` is the message being sent.\n\n**Step 2: Code on the Parent Page to Capture the Iframe Message**  \nNow, on the parent page (where the iframe is embedded), you need code to capture the `postMessage` sent by the iframe and push it to the dataLayer.\n\nAdd this code to the parent page:\n\n    htmlCopy code<script>\n      window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {\n        if (event.data === 'bookNowClicked') {\n          dataLayer.push({\n            \"event\": \"cta_booknow_click\", // Name of the event that will be captured by GTM\n          });\n        }\n      });\n    </script>\n    \n\n**Explanation of the Code:**\n\n* `window.addEventListener('message', ...)`: Adds a listener that captures messages sent from the iframe to the parent page.\n* `if (event.data === 'bookNowClicked')`: Checks if the received message indicates that the \"Book Now\" button was clicked.\n* `dataLayer.push`: Pushes the `cta_booknow_click` event to the dataLayer, which will be captured and processed by Google Tag Manager.",

Then I use my debugger extension (tag hound is my go-to), and I hope that the demo site/current client has a GTM container added.

The custom javascript variable can be seen below:\n\n    function() {\n      var a = {{Custom JavaScript Variable}};\n      return a.includes(\"footer\") ? \"footer\" : a.includes(\"bookingForm\") ? \"bookingform\" : \"unknown\"\n    }\n        \n\nSomething to consider if you want to see for yourself, or keep this strategy in your back pocket for another time.",

This has worked flawlessly.\n* In the past, we integrated GA4 directly via snippets into the website code. However, now that we’re using Google Tag as well, the GA4 snippet would be used twice since our GA4, Google Ads, and Google Tag are connected, this makes the direct snipped redundant, right?\n* Google Tag Manager is already firing our purchase events without any additional GA4 tag setup. Is this normal? Will I lose any tracking if I don’t set up an additional tag for GA4 and GoogleAds?\n* I am using a third-party booking software that sends the purchase event to GA4, and we’ve connected the same purchase event in Google Ads. Am I correct in assuming that I don’t need to install the Google Ads tracking code (AW) additionally since the purchase data is already coming from GA4?\n\nLast but not least, the Google Ads tracking gets quite often lost between my WebSite and the final purchase event on the third-party website... in almost 30-50% of cases (it just indicates direct source in GA4), is there any trick to keep the attribution?\n\nThanks a lot!",

You can create a trigger, and, well, trigger the Google Ads conversion tag when it happens.\n\nFor example:  \n\\-> someone visits the \"thank you page\" -> Google Ads Conversion Tracking Tag is firing.\n\nThis will work. You're very likely to use exactly this set up for the Facebook/Twitter/Whatever pixel conversion tracking\n\nBut alternatively (preferably?), you can use the above trigger to trigger not the Google Ads conversion, but to send the event to GA.\n\nExample\n\n\\-> Someone visits the \"thank you page\" -> Google Analytics: GA4 Even Tag is firing.\n\nThat tag sent the event and other information you choose to sent, to Google Analytics, and you'll see it in the settings (admin) -> property -> Data display -> events (note, it may take 24 hours or more before you see it there).\n\nThen you can mark this event as **key event** (if it's named \"purchase\", then it's likely already marked that way)\n\nThen you just need to link the GA and Google Ads(property setting/ product links).\n\nAnd you can go to Google Ads, and you can import your Key events from GA as Goals (Goals -> Create Conversion Action -> Import)\n\n4) So it's more or less the same thing that point 3, but instead of the GTM sending the event to GA, Booking platform do it, right? Sounds like it may work. I would be cautiously optimistic  about it (but not an expert, or experienced in that area).",

We experienced unusual drop in page visits in Analytics (flagged also as anomaly by GA), and some users were complaining that they were trying to do a reservation and when they were trying to send us the reservation (click on a button), all the data from their form would disappear and they couldn't finish the process. \n\nAfter trying a few things, I found out that if the user does not accept cookies, a weird code gets generated and it is added after the original URL when they click on a link eg:\\_gl=5\\*122rme\\*\\_up\\*SQ..\\*\\_ga\\*BTc4STUzSzQyOC4xNzFxQUQ0OTgz\\*\\_ga\\_84KRT983QW\\*MTczMTk0PRDKi4xLjAuMTczMTk0NDkL3TSwLjAuMA (changed the codes with some random letters as I don't know if these codes can be used for something as there are our GA tags for example but the structure is there) and it throws 403. \n\nAt the moment I have disabled GTM and everything works fine again, but I am trying to understand what is happening and why this gets generated.

        "author": "trucker-123",
        "id": "1gjfobn",
        "selftext": "Hi.  I am using the Cookie Script consent banner (Cookie Script is a certified Google Ads CMP partner) only in the UK and EU for my website.  This means that for countries outside the UK and EU, the Cookie Script consent banner is not being shown on my website. I installed the Cookie Script consent banners with a tag in GTM (Google Tag Manager).\n\nNow the problem is, in Google Ads, the conversion count column on the Campaign Report is not counting some conversions for customers outside the UK and EU.  In fact, I did a test and I clicked on my own ad in Google outside the UK/EU (so I was not given the consent banner), registered on my own website, and I was not counted as a conversion in Google Ads.\n\nI asked Cookie Script support about this and they recommended in GTM, that I set \"Default Consent (Global)\" for my Cookie Script consent banners settings to \"Granted\", and then under \"Default Consent (Region-specific),\" I should add UK and add each country in the EU and set them to \"Denied.\"  \n\nI took a screenshot of Cookie Script support's answer, gave it to Google Ads customer support, and then asked Google Ads customer support if I could do this, and they said no, I can't do it, because setting \"Default Consent (Global)\" for my Cookie Script consent banners settings to \"Granted\" could violate customer privacy outside the UK and EU.  I then asked Google Ads support again if setting \"Default Consent (Global)\" being set to \"Denied\" in GTM is causing some of my customers to not being counted as conversions in Google Ads outside the UK and EU, but they repeated the same customer privacy issue and wouldn't answer my question.\n\nSo given that my consent banner only appears for customers inside the UK and EU, but the consent banner won't appear for customers outside the UK and EU, I have a few questions:\n\n1) Does anybody know if \"Default Consent (Global)\" being set to \"Denied\" would cause conversions to not be counted for customers outside the UK and EU, if my consent banner isn't shown to customers outside the UK and EU? (this is the question that Google Ads customer support refuses to answer directly)\n\n2) Is there a way in GTM where I can have the Cookie Script consent banner tag suppressed outside the UK and EU, so that the issue of consent isn't even on the table outside the UK and EU (would this make it legal outside the UK/EU if consent isn't even on the table like the old days?), and would this work with Google Ads conversion counting?  Before the Cookie Script consent banner and before I transitioned to GTM, I was just using the old Google Ads conversion tag script and conversion counting was working fine in Google Ads - I assume with the old Google Ads conversion tag script, the issue of consent isn't even on the table for outside the UK and EU, so I assume nothing is even violated?",

Without a cookie banner or other consent mechanism, it's odd that the consent would change.\n\nIf you click on the 'container loaded' and 'DOM Ready' events in Tag Assistant, is your consent set to 'Denied' at those stages? If it's granted, this might not be affecting your tracking. Make sure you're clearing your cookies if you've already accepted tracking on the EU version of the site.\n\nNow, I obviously can't tell you this for certain, but it's very unlikely that Google would take action against your account for consent related stuff outside the European Economic Area, which is where they're mostly worried about. And they would most likely warn you before banning you. \n\nI've seen Google Ads threaten accounts in the past for accidentally collecting email addresses in URLs, and they gave the client a couple of months to fix it before they would disable the account. \n\nThat being said, if you were to implement the cookie banner for other regions, you could set it to opt-out rather than opt-in and you'd be fine under the majority of global privacy laws (disclaimer: this is not legal advice). Many users just ignore it completely, so it won't affect your tracking nearly as much as an opt-in banner.\n\nGoogle Support just can't risk recommending something that might violate some country's law, and it's pretty much impossible to know all of them.",

Just check to see if there are values in the Consent tab. \n\nTo your second question, it's theoretically possible but difficult (GTM doesn't inherently know where users are and consent values load before anything else) and I don't think there would be a legal difference between defaulting to granted vs not sending any consent values at all (though I'm not a lawyer).\n\nI'm guessing Google doesn't want to tell you to default to granted while not showing a banner because it would technically violate some privacy laws like CCPA (which requires a way for users to opt out). But whether cookies are granted in GTM just affects tag functionality; you're not using those values as a consent log or anything like that. \n\nI would go with Cookie Script's recommendation, and also consider showing the banner with opt-out defaults in other regions to make sure that you're generally compliant with other privacy laws.",

You will find that on the script provided by the consent management platform. Note: As you're setting this up from google tag manager so don’t put that script to the header. Then trigger the tag to consent initialization.

GA4 Event, Conversion Linker, Floodlights, Google Ads... they will all still fire without consent.\n\nYou can check this in Tag Assistant, but in reality it is best to jump into Chrome dev tools to have a look in the Network tab.\n\nFor GA4, filter the Network tab data with \"collect?v=2\" (or your GA4 measurement ID. Click on one of the hits. Click on \"Payload\". Look for the **gcs** parameter.\n\nPrior to granting consent, users in the UK and EU should not be tracked and the value of the **gcs** parameter should be **G100**\n\nAs soon as the user grants full consent, the value of the gcs parameter should be **G111**.\n\nI can get into so much more detail about this that you might want me to just not... but shout if you need more help.",

You only need one, fired on initialization and with send\\_page\\_view set to false.\n\nFor measuring page views, create a GA4 Event tag, the event name will be page\\_view and you fire that on all pages with an All Pages Page View trigger.\n\nAssuming you're OK with the Consent Mode modelling - i.e. gcs=G100 / \"cookieless pings\", then you don't need to add additional consent requirements to Google tags (or GA4 Event tags, Conversion Linker etc). If you wanted to absolutely block the tags so that no data at all was being sent to Google without consent, you could add more consent requirements and that would cause the tags to stop firing.",

Now, they have the sort of catch-all Google tag. When you are in Tag Manager creating a new tag, you get a list of tag options to choose from. In the main list, there is a Google Analytics subsection, but there is also just a \"Google Tag\" option below it in the main list. However, when you go into the Google Analytics subsection, it has what appears to be the same \"Google Tag\" (and the GA4 Events tag). My understanding is the the Google Tag itself collects most of the basic events for analytics, but my question is this: Assuming that I don't need to set up any special events, do I need to create a tag using the \"Google Tag\" under the Google Analytics section AND create a tag using the \"Google Tag\" option on the main list? Or is that just the same thing? \n\nHopefully I explained that well enough. I was [following this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8_sbW63sH0&list=PLI5YfMzCfRtZs_2SypnheSkr8PMi4ZhbI&index=2&ab_channel=GoogleAnalytics) and it just shows you how to set up the Google tag with Tag Manager. As you can see, he selects the Google tag present in the main list. So I'm just wondering if I need to do anything more than that to get basic analytics because it seems as though there is no difference between that tag and the one in the \"Google Analytics\" section (excluding the events tag).

I do not see the Google Tag type at all, and searching for it does not reveal it, either. \n\nI have checked my account permissions and I have the ability to publish, read, and write changes, so I should be able to add the right types. \n\nIs there another setting/permission that I need in order to access the Google Tag type?",

The new TAG (and so the GA4 events) I created of course have different names than the agency one.\n\nWhat should I do? Wait till the 31st to publish my GTM tag?

The industry standard is all these accounts belong to the client. If the client doesn't have them prior to working with an agency, the agency can create them in the client's name, but the client must always be the primary owner.

But a GTM account is usually and should be owned by the client. If it is owned by client then that is your appeal. If not then make it your responsibility that the client creates an account for themselves. Don't make the same mistake as the other agency, do the work the way it's meant to be done.",

Having trouble understanding the point of the \"Google Tag\" when I'm measuring my website data with GA4 and using the \"Google Ads Conversion Tracking\" tag to measure conversions from Google Ads.\n\nWhat role/benefit does the Google Tag provide? I'm sure there's a point to it since Google is recommending it so much, but I'm not seeing it. Does it help make attribution more accurate? Help manage cross-device tracking, or?\n\nI've been Google searching for this, but when I type in \"Google Tag\", it's giving me results about \"Google Tag Manager.\" I'm just curious about the Google Tag 😂",

The main differences in the new versions of this script (besides it now being marketed as Google Tag) are:\n\n\n- No external dependencies. Depending on the product that you were initializing with the gtag.js API, some additional external files had to be downloaded on order to make use of certain functionality. Most of this is now baked into the same script.\n\n\n\n- Shared configuration across multiple accounts/destinations. Previously, initializing multiple tag ids on the same page/site would download a unique version of gtag.js for each initialized tag id, as each account and tag might contain different settings. \n\n\n- Additional features.",

There are two ways to manage gtag behavior: directly within page code by adding additional script to the gtag, or through Tag Manager which injects any new script into page code through the gtag.\n\nAs an example, when creating a new conversion action in GAds, you are given the option of adding it as a snippet of event code directly to the site right after the gtag OR you can add it through Tag Manager. Best bet, where possible choose the Tag Manager route because it's less dependant on others to get work done. In my experience, adding new script directly to the site is a notoriously slow process because developers usually have a backlog of work ahead of your request.",

I am hoping my issue is just a lack of basic understanding of how this all works. I decided to DIY Google ads for my business. I have used google tag manager to set everything up. However, it didn't work at first and my conversions were not going through to google ads. After hours of messing about, I have made this mess.... \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI cant post photos... so no clue how to show this but. i have made a Tag with the below triggers.\n\n**Tag type**: Google Ads Conversion Tracking - Google ads\n\n**Triggering**\n\nAll Pages : *Page view*\n\nConsent Intialization - All Pages - *Consent Initialisation*\n\nInitialization - All Pages - *Initialization*\n\nPage Url Equals Booking Complete - *Page View*\n\nTag - *Page view* \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have no clue what I actually need in this mess... but once i had the above it started to work. I assume a lot of this is doubled up and i dont actually need them all. The most important is the Page Url equals booking complete as that tracks when someone sucessfully books on. \n\nIt also tells me that my conversion linker tag is missing in the container? But pages are triggering otherwise and heading over to google.\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated. ",

I already have a Google Ads Conversion Tag setup and it has been working well for me for years. The existing Google Ads Conversion Tag script on my website looks like this:\n\n><script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-123456789\"></script>\n>\n><script>\n>\n>      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n>\n>      function gtag() { dataLayer.push(arguments); }\n>\n>      gtag('js', new Date());\n>\n>\n>      gtag('config', 'AW-123456789');\n>\n></script>  \n\nI have not created a Google Tag Manager account, and of course, I have not installed the Google Tag Manager script on my website yet.\n\nThe best I could find was [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uELet8yUns) but in that video, it just shows how to create a new Google Ads Conversion Tag in Google Tag Manager. Can I not use my existing Google Ads Conversion Tag or am I supposed to make a new one?\n\nSo I guess I am supposed to:\n\n1) Create a new Conversion Action in Google Ads (or can I reuse my current Conversion  Action that is already setup with my Google Ads Conversion Tag above?)\n\n2) Get the Conversion ID and Conversion Label of this new Conversion Action\n\n3) Create a new Google Tag Manager account\n\n4) Remove the Google Ads Conversion Script above\n\n5) Install the Google Tag Manager script at the top of the <head> and <body> tags\n\n6) In GTM, setup Tag Configuration and copy the Conversion ID and Conversion Label here\n\n7) In GTM setup Triggering\n\n8) In GTM create a Conversion Linker tag\n\nDid I get this right?",

What other Google tags do you mean when you say multiple? Like, for example, using GA4 and your Google Ads remarketing tag? Or something different?\n2. Yes. What type of tag ID are you trying to combine?\n3. Google Tag Manager as a platform is designed for the installation and management of many different types of tracking codes (not just Google tags) on your website(s). It's not really related to combining Google Tags like you're talking about\n   1. Yes, on the GTM homepage there is a little \"Google Tags\" tab where you can look at your associated tags, but this is not the primary use case for GTM\n4. You can import GA4 conversions (or \"Key Events\" as they're now called) into your Google Ads account. Whatever custom variables or parameters you set up in the GA4 event won't have any effect within Google Ads however. You're just simply importing the conversion.",

It did a fairly good job of answering all of your questions and would be helpful to some degree. \n\nBesides that, I would just put it out there that you would want to use Google Tag Manager to manage all of your marketing tags. You would install a unique GTM code snippet on one website. So, if you have multiple websites, each site would have its own unique GTM container. \n\nWithin a GTM container you can set up multiple Tags to do different things. One Tag could be your Google Analytics Configuration tag that fires the baseline Google Analytics 4 code onto each page. Other Tags could be Google Analytic Events that fire events into GA4 depending on what user actions you want to track. \n\nHope this helps some.",

After a successful purchase, Stripe loads a success page that quickly redirects the user back to our domain.\n* I’ve implemented a `dataLayer.push` with the event `purchase_success` on the Stripe success page, which should trigger GTM to capture the event.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\n* The success page loads very quickly and redirects almost immediately, which seems to be causing GTM not to load in time to capture the `purchase_success` event.

Google seems to be unreasonably bad at explaining anything related to the tag, And any support I've found is equally as bad. Is it so hard to just TELL US HOW THE DAMN THING WORKS?  \n\n\n\\> \"You've set it up incorrectly\"  \nThe only instruction are \"Copy and Paste these 4 lines of JS code into the header tag of your website\". That's a pretty simple instruction, and easy to verify. Yes I can check the developer console to see the code is indeed in the header tag, And Yes I can check the network to see the google tag request is being sent properly. WHAT ELSE IS THERE?\n\n\\> \"You gotta wait 24 to 48 hours\"  \nWe've waited 480 hours. If it magically turns on we'd be able to see it. This isn't a helpful insight.\n\n\\> \"It only tracks the clicked Ads\"  \nYes and we've gone in and clicked on the ads many times over a long period of time. My test case is \"THE HOMEPAGE IS VIEWED\". You'd think that'd be a pretty simple case to test, Given  that the Ad goes to the home page. You'd think a PAGE LOAD would be an easy thing to track.\n\n\\> \"You need a Google Global Tag Manager in order for your Ads Tag to work\"  \nI'd certainly hope that Google itself would mention this somewhere, anywhere, if this is true. Do we need 2 tags? What's the point of the 2nd tag? You'd think you could just link the Global  tag to the Ads tracking events? \n\nIt boggles my mind how bad Google's Tracking systems are, especially since it's a primary business for Google. There's not 4 steps to the setup, and it's basically nothing more than a copy / paste. HOW ON EARTH can you screw up that installation if you know what you're doing? And yet it's not working. And there's NOTHING seemingly we can do to troubleshoot it. When I use Google's Troubleshooting tool, It tells me \"We didn't detect the trigger\". The PAGE  LOAD trigger. Even though I can see the tag and see the network request from the tag. Even though I'm ON THE PAGE. Even though there's literally nothing else to do with it. No details on what the issue is. Again, You'd think that Google could say \"From this request, We got THIS data, Which did / didn't trigger THIS tag\".",

I gave up on the Google Tag Manager after several hours. It shows up in the source HTML, but Google's backend does not detect the tags. I tried several tags, and then said, “Screw this, I want to do something else now.”\n\nThe rest of my comment is mixed with opinion and slight ranting. I have fading interest when things piss me off, as does a lot Google issues I run into. I'm a very tech savvy individual who also enjoys the challenge of solving problems – when there is actually a solution, and you learn something from it, always enjoy those. However, anytime I run into an issue with Google, I end up wasting hours only to find there is no solution. A lot of times the solution with Google is to downgrade the app, use the old version, or wait for Google to get off their asses and listen to feedback. Thus my fading interest when I'm faced with a Google related issue. \n\nIn this circumstance, I just used a simple Header Footer snippet plugin and copy and pasted the tags manually for each Analytics, like the old days. Told my clients that Tag Manager is in beta and broken right now.\n\nThe whole idea of Google Tag Manager was to be able to include other tags, from other vendors, nice and clean – so the idea was anyways. However Google has implemented it, it does not work. Why can't Google make simple, easy to use, straight forward products anymore. They used to be at the edge pushing neat features and things that just clicked and made a lot of sense. Google used to leave you with the feeling/thinking of, “wow, why don't other companies do it this way?”\n\nThis is off-topic from our original comments, but more and more I'm constantly asking myself, wow why does Google do this stupid crap. I'm not a Google hater because of the products they kill, I'm hating Google more and more everyday because things don't “just work” like they used to. Or they do things that don't make sense. \n\nLike moving Google My Biz to Search team, and making you type in search to find your businesses, using the Maps app to Manage your business; it's all clunky. They charge for Google Voice in Workspace, and it is still that abandoned back burner project. Google search doesn't even show relevant results. GBoard (Google Keyboard) keeps (it just changed keeps into keys) autocorrecting entire sentences after I move to the next, and hitting backspace doesn't undo the change or teach the algorithm/AI that I didn't want that change. I'm sometimes scared to send messages typed on my phone without thoroughly reading them to make sure that my sentences didn't get changed. That when I change my sentences back to what I intended, that they dont get changed again. Google makes me so mad.",

Let's say you want to send contact form conversion to Meta pixel, TikTok and Reddit. You can do it all in one go using TagWizard.\n\n3) Added features, e.g Javascript Variable Builder.

Thus the tag is triggered, but doesn't complete before the current page is unloaded.\n\nI haven't had to try to fix this one, but I've seen one strategy where you try to delay the next page load. I'm not a fan of that, because it just seems a fraglie way to do things that can be changed by a browser at any time.\n\nThe other strategy is to carry over all of the data you need to the next page and then fire the tag on page load. That seems a more sensible option.",

A week ago, I officially removed my Google Tag script and to replace it, I installed GTM, along with installing the Google Ads Conversion Tag for it, and installing the Conversion Linker Tag.  This was all done a week ago, but I am still not getting any conversion data yet in my Google Ads reports. Anyways, I was able to create a new Conversion Goal and set the Action Optimization for this Conversion Goal as Secondary, which means it should be used for observation only and it won't interfere with the bidding of any campaigns. I want to install the old Google Tag script and get it to work with this new \"observation\" Conversion Goal, to see if it picks up conversions for Google Ads, where the GTM Conversion Tag is not picking up conversions in Google Ads.\n\nMy question is, can I install the older Google Tag script at the same time my Google Tag Manager script is installed on my pages without causing any problems?  I notice that the Google Tag script references https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js  and requires an ID pattern of AW-????????? whereas the Google Tag Manager script references https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js and requires an ID pattern of GTM-????????, so it looks like they reference different libraries?\n\nWill the old Google Tag script and the Google Tag Manger script work separately of each other if they are on the same page, or will they interfere and cause problems?",

This time it's all me, and I don't have an IT background.  \nI've watched a bunch of tutorials and have a pretty good idea where to start except for one issue: do I install Google Tag Manager first and use it to install GA4? Or do I set up the accounts separately and then link GA4 to GTM? Google doesn't seem to have an easily discoverable answer and so I thought I would ask you smart folks. TIA.  \n",

        "selftext": "My client has been tearing his hair out for 2 months trying to move to GA4 and get tags working. He wants to monitor traffic on his ecommerce site, log when products are viewed, and when they are purchased so he can tie it up with his ad spend. It seems like this is the meat and potatoes of what GA4 should do, he's not wanting anything exotic, so I said I'd try to help because I assumed he's doing something wrong. I should add that we use Google Mail and have done for probably 15 years or so, and as a developer I work with Android and rich snippets and various other Google code. So I am not an IT newb.\n\nThe client added me as a user to his account. When I go to my Google Analytics panel, I can see his site in there now. Can click on it and view details. \n\nIt gives me some code to put on the web site, and when I check, this is exactly what we have there already. So that much appears good. Also, I can see how many users in the last half hour, etc. so data is coming in.\n\nNow I note that the code it gives me to put on the site links to the domain [googletagmanager.com](https://googletagmanager.com). So this GA4 code seems to basically be Google Tag Manager, or at least very closely related.\n\nSo I am thinking now I need to look at tags, maybe create some. But there is nowhere to do this in the GA4 panel. After some flailing around ( everything seems to be several clicks away from where it feels like it should be) I am informed that I need to go to Google Tag Manager. I follow the link, and duly log in. This feels a bit strange. I am not sure why I am logging into \\*another\\* Google system. It feels like this should all be in the same place, since GA4 code to place on your web site literally links to [googletagmanager.com](https://googletagmanager.com). Anyhow, I go with it.\n\nBut in Google Tag Manager, I see his domain, but it looks like an old ID. It starts GTM- instead of G- and the rest is completely different. I cannot see his new GA4 ID in there, the one that their Analytics panel shows and whose ID is baked into the code to put on the web site and which was shared with my account.\n\nAt this point I really have no idea how to create tags for an ID that doesn't appear in my Google Tag Manager panel, but has been shared with me via Google Analytics.\n\nThis all feels very half-baked. I've gone through the documents, but it all sends me round in circles, following links back to Google Tag Manager where the ID I need to work with is not present.\n\nDoes the client have to separately give me access to their web site ID in Google Tag Manager, even though they already shared it in Google Analytics? Is there a reason why Google decided that Analytics and Google Tag Manager should be separate entities, rather than a single integrated system, which would seem to make more sense?\n\n&#x200B;",

If its there, it means GA4 is manually coded into the website. But if its not there, and you can find the GTM ID instead, then GA4 is installed via GTM.",

It *is* likely to be the Google Tag, which is a relatively new, unified script that instantiates one or more Google platforms e.g. GA4 and/or gAds. It cannot instantiate GTM though. Yes, Google have fumbled their naming scheme exactly as badly as this sounds. Compounded further by them and others calling on-site scripts \"tags\", which are 100% distinct from tags within GTM.\n\nGood to know: you cannot create any tags within GA4 (oh how I hope this comment ages like wine instead of milk!). You can create or even modify existing \"events\" based on rules and you can mark those events as conversions (soon to be renamed as \"conversions and key events\").\n\nIf you want fine-grained control over data collection, that's where you might turn to GTM. The GTM script can replace the existing Google Tag and from within GTM you would then implement GA4 and any other platforms you wanted to pass data to.\n\nGTM is essentially a visual programming environment where you modify a container, which then is compiled down to a javascript file hosted on [googletagmanager.com](https://googletagmanager.com) and instantiated by a specific script you will find when clicking on the GTM-XXXXX ID within GTM. *Even there*, there is an inconsistency, because it instructs you to implement 2 pieces of code, only the first of which is actually relevant.\n\nYes... this is probably overly complicated. It keeps me in a job.\n\nDo shout if you want some specific help with this!",

This was all working before I removed things and put everything but the following into Google Tag Manager.\n\ngtag('event', 'conversion', {'send\\_to': '<removed>','value': <order value>,'currency': 'USD','transaction\\_id': '<transaction>',});\n\nSo I added the following back to the page.  The gtag function no longer throws an error.  Is mixing gtag.js and Google Tag Manager OK?  Or can this cause unforeseen issues?  Thanks!\n\n<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->    \n\n\n<script async src=\"\\\\\\[https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=\\\\\\](https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=)<Adwords ID>\"></script>    \n\n\n<script>    \n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || \\\\\\\\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\];    \n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}    \n  gtag('js', new Date());    \n  gtag('config', '<ID from Google>');    \n</script>    \n",

But when I check the total orders (example:100 orders), Analytics only shows 20. So, there's data missing.\n2. **Tag Verification**: I checked all the tags and IDs in GTM and everything seems correct. This includes the server and the web container setups.\n3. **Web vs. Server Containers**: In the web container of GTM, all tags are working fine. However, in the server container, I can't see any previews. I don't know if it is normal, as I ony have the tag to comunicate between GTM and GA4.\n\nI'm searching for a while and I can't understand the issue. Someone can help? Thanks",

After hearing about GTM for over a decade, I’m finally getting a chance to get my hands dirty.\n\nFirst order of business was creating a GA4 event tag for form submissions across the site. Seems to be working.\n\nThen I created a Google Ads Conversion tag for email subscription conversions, a more specific form of form subscription. It appears to be firing appropriately according to the preview/debugger. But I found it odd that, even though my GA4 and Google Ads accounts are already linked, that this second conversion isn’t showing up anywere in GA4 automatically. Is it normal Google Ad Conversions tags in Tag Manager do not automatically show up in GA4 tracking, and that I’ll have to make a GA4 event tag to measure this type of conversion?\n\nFurther question - am I correct that Google Ads will only count this GTM email subscription tag as a conversion if it is, in fact, a conversion that stems from a respective Google Ad?\n\nWould it make more sense to just start with the GA4 event tag and pipe that into Google Ads as a conversion, rather than make separate GA4 and Ads tags in Tag Manager? Wouldn’t that kill two birds with just the one stone?",

Its just better to use the GA4 and Ads tags. However, the real pain is setting up just the trigger tag. Once you set up trigger for say email subscription then all you need to send it to GA4 is use the appropriate tag, enter property ID, give it an event name like email_subscription and thats it. One trigger can be used to send that data to anything like GA4, Ads etc…\n\n3. Yes, it will only count it as conversion if it is from Ads. But if you send it to GA4 too through a tag then it will show up in GA4 regardless of source.",

While setting up a custom add_to_cart event, I see the options in this [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/OaQ06GS). The Wix add_to_cart event is outlined [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/setting-up-business-events-with-google-tag-manager#business-events-sent-by-wix). The event model in this case is\n\n```\nWix EEC event\naddToCart\nWix EEC Payload\necommerce: {\n  add: {\n      products: [\n        {\n          category: \"All Products\",\n          currency: \"USD\",\n          id: \"df19c1f7-07d8-a265-42f8-e8dfa824cc6e\",\n          quantity: 1,\n          name: \"Product 1\",\n          sku: \"123\",\n          price: 85,\n          type: \"physical\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n```\n\nIt doesn't have currency, transaction_value and item_count on the base level - but is nested inside the product array.\n\nI can populate it using a data layer variable defined to be `ecommerce.add.products.0.currency`. While it works, it seems repetitive. So, I tried to define a products datalayer variable as 'ecommerce.add.products` and reference {{products}}.0.currency. However, this doesn't work, and shows up as [object Object].0.currency. \n\nAlso is it possible for me to have the Product Information section (from screenshot) filled in based on the product array? If I want to do that I seem to have to create a row for each possible entry in the products array (but, I can't know the number of rows in the even beforehand).  Or is that for some other purpose?\n\nAlso, what is conversion_id (again from screenshot)? It doesn't seem to be in the payload from Wix - do i map some other field to it.\n\nWhat would the best way be to map these fields to the reddit pixel tag? Thanks",

I've got a team of devs that can help me install the code and all sorts.\n\nMy question is: can I somehow get back our GTM account? or create a new one and start from scratch - if there's already one account created.",

But when it comes to e-commerce functionality, they also rely on Google Tag defined through the WooCommerce plugin. This ensures proper functioning of the data layer and provides e-commerce events. On the other hand, it seems that the Google Tag from WooCommerce is loaded before the CMP, and this has led to some complications in configuring this combination effectively.  \nI'm reaching out to the community to seek advice on the best practices for configuring WooCommerce, Google Tag Manager, and a consent management tool like Cookiebot. I want to ensure that our e-commerce events work seamlessly while also maintaining compliance with GDPR. One way would be to define the ecommerce events manually, and keep the Google Tag only in the GTM, but I hope there would be a more simple way to do it.",

We're trying to make sense of Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics and Google Ads in the following context: We have a contact form on our website and are already tracking \"success – sent\" as a tag/trigger in GTM. Now we would like to use this tag to a) track the event overall in Analytics and b) track the event as a goal/conversion for Google Ads. Is there a way to use one tag for both? And Google Ads conversion cleverly can distinguish by acquisition? Or do I have to set up redundantly one GA4 and one Google Ad variant of the tag. Googling for this topic always brings up just ONE aspect of the both. Could someone point us to the best tutorial/help site/blog post? Help is much appreciated! Thank you!",

My client is just starting her photography business in a fairly small town and we simply wanted to set up Analytics to be able to track how her updated SEO-copy is doing.\n\nAny guidance is GREATLY appreciated!!

Any kind of DOM event such as page loads, mouse clicks etc.\n\n'Complex' events (which isn't an industry term btw, mostly it's referred to as a Custom Event) are more application function oriented. An example is something like the act of logging into an application. A browser doesn't have an explicit native DOM event for when a user logs into an application. It's just a bunch of button clicks, form submissions and page loads as far as it's aware.\n\nYou might be able to derive the fact that a login has occurred from a page load event of a particular URL, but that's a messy (although sometimes necessary) way of doing it, as your event identifiers are \"decoupled\". Yeah, a page load occurred, but what happens if your developer changes the url of the page?\n\nA complex event like this can be declared in a dataLayer. This is a neater, clearer way of telling GTM (and thus GA) that a login event has occurred.\n\nTo declare a dataLayer event, the following needs to be somewhere in your source code:\n\n    <script>\n        dataLayer.push(\n             { 'event' : 'login' }\n        );\n    </script>\n\nGTM can pick that up as a Custom Event, and use it as a trigger.\n\nNote that the value \"login\" can be anything you want. There are no predefined values that GTM is expecting. So that could've just as easily been \"application-login\".\n\nThis means you can use it for anything. An example that I have in real life is \"sales.funnel.step.1.complete\" to denote the completion of the 1st stage of my 4 stage sales funnel.",

I set up two Google Tag Manager variables of type Data Layer Variable inside of Google Tag Manager, **actionType and vid**.  \n \n3. I added a GA tag with the following:  \n **Track Type: Event (wrong?)**  \n Action: {{Event}}  \n **Google Analytics settings: {{Tracking ID - GA - Settings}} (wrong?)**  \n Custom Dimensions: 1 {{Properties - Actiontype}} 2 {{Properties - VID}}  \n Triggering: Button Click (Custom Event)  \n \n4. Added a trigger in Google Tag Manager with:  \n Trigger Type: Custom Event  \n Event Name: btnclick  \n \n\nI am not sure if the Track Type inside GA tag is correct, and I am not sure if the Google Analytics settings is correct. In the tutorial, the guy uses Page View, so I am unsure if I chose the correct settings and whether it would work. I am pushing into the dataLayer after the jQuery event listener for click is triggered.\n\nWould this allow me to get the view count for all videos (We have about 1,000 videos)?\n\nAlso, upon setting custom dimension, we are given these instructions:\n\n    Example Codes for This Dimension Copy the following code snippet for your platform. DO NOT FORGET to replace dimensionValue with your own.  JavaScript (gtag.js) For instructions on how to setup custom dimensions using gtag.js, please refer to the gtag.js developer documentation.

If I'm collecting all possible automatic events through enhanced measurement in GA4 but with also using custom dimensions for events parameters (e.g.: link\\_URL parameter for outbound click) that I manually set-up in GA4 Events tab, would moving to a set-up where I fire GA4 tag through GTM stop those from being collected? \n2. Would I need to set again in GTM those event parameters that I had already set-up in GA4 or would they carry-over?\n3. Also, if I set-up in GTM a custom event with GTM that belongs to one of these enhanced measurement categories, would it measure duplicate (1x for GTM event 1x for enhanced measurement) ?\n\nThanks in advance",

If you use the base GA4 Configuration Tag in GTM, in essence all that is doing is running the gtag on your site. But, it does have a few benefits (you can send custom parameters or user properties with those hits). \n3. I would think they would still double and you'd have 2x page\\_view\\_example\\_A but again, I haven't tested this myself.",

Are you basically asking if you move from a gtag embedded on the site to a GTM container where you have a configuration tag firing, will that affect Enhanced Measurement? No, it should not as long as you remove the gtag and install the published GTM container at the same time.\n2. You shouldn't need to modify the parameters you set up in GA4 event editor.\n3. This is an interesting question and I'm not entirely certain, but I see no reason it wouldn't double. But you can obviously test this yourself. And if you'd prefer to fire an event tag through GTM, you can just turn off that event in the data stream enhanced measurement settings (except for pageview which is turned ON ~~off~~ if any enhanced measurement is enabled).  \n\n\nEdit: was typing on my phone earlier and had a couple typos.",

        "selftext": "Hi All.\n\nI have setup a site with Universal Analytics to use the Tag Manager consent features in conjunction with a Consent Platform and all is working fine on that front. The problem I have is that when a visitor does not give consent to analytics cookies, even though the analytics hits are still sent to Google Analytics, this data does not show up in any reports.\n\nApparently this a known issue (Thanks to [/u/sahava](https://www.reddit.com/u/sahava/) for his [blog post](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/consent-mode-google-tags/#restrict-analytics-storage) that helped me finally figure out what was going on) and is due to a new parameter gcs, which includes the consent status of the hit. All traffic with the gcs parameter set doesn't show up at all in the Analytics dashboard.\n\nAs this is a news publisher site, Analytics numbers are very important so I am trying to figure out a workaround. So far I have come up with two possible ideas but have no clue if they are possible or how to implement.\n\n1. One workaround would be to remove the gcs parameter from the hits sent to Analytics. Is this possible? Any pointers to documentation or code that shows how this could be done would be really appreciated. I did try google with no luck.\n2. The second workaround would be to use the \"storage: none\" method as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4502128/convert-google-analytics-cookies-to-local-session-storage/19207035#19207035). While this works fine and hits are sent and counted without cookies being set, I can't figure out a way to update this if a user consents to setting cookies. What value should storage be set to for normal operation with cookies? Is is possible to push a new config value with gtag commands that takes effect without refreshing the page?\n\nI would really appreciate any pointers or feedback on the ideas above or to hear any other suggestions or solutions that might help solve this problem.",

For example:  \n\\- If you don't remove it, someone else could be running their own pixels, GA code, etc... and stealing your data. If it's an agency that lacks integrity, they may be working with others in your space and using your own data to fill a targeting pool for those clients (just one of many examples of why this is risky to leave on the page)\n\n\\- If the other container is changing values in the dataLayer that you will also be accessing/changing with your container, you need to consider whether your container code should go above or below the existing code so those values aren't re-written before your tags fire (if you're eComm, this can be really important)  \n\n\nHard to say, but if you absolutely can't track it down I'd probably recommend removing it, then checking all your relevant vendors that might have been using it to see if anything breaks (Google Analytics (check all custom dimensions, eComm if applicable, etc...), Google Ads, Facebook, LinkedIn insight tags, cookie pop-up behavior on your site, other functionality on your site, etc....)",

        "author": "selderzzzz",
        "id": "lpnh7i",
        "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI've been working on setting up enhanced eCommerce tracking for a webshop using Google Tag Manager. I'm trying to track what products have been viewed, added to the cart, purchased etc. I manage to pull data out of the datalayer and send it to Google Analytics. The only issue is that it is possible to view or purchase multiple products at once and I want to track all of those.\n\nThe way the datalayer is made each product that is viewed, added to the cart or purchased has a number in it. For example:\n\n* ecommerce.impressions.0.name would be the first product\n* ecommerce.impressions.1.name would be the second product\n* ecommerce.impressions.2.name would be the third product\n\nCurrently, to get it working into Google analytics I made a total of 5 tags each using the same properties except the label changes to a different datalayer variable based on the number described above. This way I can track 5 products that have been viewed from the webshop catalog or are purchased. To measure an additional product I would have to make a new tag.\n\nHowever, I have the feeling this is not the way it should be done as it is a bit inconvenient and it makes a mess in Google Tag Manager.\n\nI tried putting them all into one single tag separating the labels with a \",\". However, this didn't import correctly into Google Analytics as it made one big label/string combining all the viewed products during the moment the tag fired instead of listing each product on its own and adding +1 impression/event count to each individual product.\n\nI hope that the issue I described is understandable. I tried adding some screenshots, but sadly that's not allowed. So if you need extra clarification, please let me know. If anyone knows how to fix this I would really appreciate it :)",

        "selftext": "I'm looking at the source code of a page that I'm inserting a script in and it gets fired however there is no trace of the code in the source code nor can I find it with inspect. Where is this code and is there anyplace where I can learn more about these more technical GTM details so I can start thinking about optimizing performance of pages etc?\n\nOne concrete example I have right now is this:\n\n1. I'm inserting a script on all pages that have a path starting with a date. So I created a custom HTML tag with a trigger that only fires on pages where the path matches a reg expression consisting of a date format. \n2.  I now need this script to load before the GTM initialization tag fires so I am adding dataLayer = dataLayer || \\[\\] ; and then pushing that data into the data layer before the GTM container.  I'm doing this in the header. However I can only change the header globally (sucks I know) so I adapted my script that it only fires on page paths that equal the same regular expression.\n\nMy issue is that it's now loading on every single page and then checking whether the path matches the regex. This has an impact on performance on ALL pages. Now here is the question: in the situation described in '1' tag manager has to check whether the page path matches the regular expression aswell to decide whether to fire the tag. Does this happen in exactly the same way as I'm now doing in '2' or is it doing so in a more efficient manner?",

GTM will check and fire the custom script if it matches the regex rule. \n\nI'm not sure what issue your are facing, though.",

In other words, it's a waste of money showing ads for certain campaigns for users that are already on the hook. If you're not utilizing the User ID features I suggest you start doing so.\n\n\n\n\nSegmentation can be done based on hostname, user properties or a combination of both depending on what you're after. Which is why two data streams doesn't make sense if you simply want to segment based on the hostname as you can easily do so even with a single stream.\n\n\n\nAs for having two data streams. You would benefit from just sticking to one. The only reason to have two would be if the main domain and subdomain require different tag settings for some reason and you've already stated that you will be using one Google Tag for both streams.\n\n\nIf you're using the same GTM container on both domains it makes even less sense having two streams as you would have to configure the container to juggle two different measurement IDs based on the hostname. This means making sure that you're not accidentally sending the same data to both streams simultaneously.",

And in my mind I know the answer is probably simple but I don't have enough experience to come up with it at the moment. Extra but inconsequential explanation. (Our website is incredibly complicated. We have two different sites A and B that interconnect and a hosting company that partners with our suppliers to automatically input inventory so we have to contact them to make changes for site B. But we have more control over site A so I need to know what I am talking about before reaching out to make changes to site B. Site B doesn't work without site A and vice versa and I am trying to step up and set up their tagging and tracking properly to start running ads.)\n\nSide question that isn't as important but how do you track conversions on an ecom site.

        "selftext": "Hello,  \nA brief introduction about myself: I have been working with network/automation for the past 20 years. Recently, I started working with Performance Marketing and noticed that our tag manager is not providing the detailed data I desire. For instance, it's not tracking link clicks or product views.  \nI strongly believe the issue lies within the company's Shopify setup, based on the following observations:  \nWhen I activate debug mode and navigate to a product page, add a product to the cart, and then open the cart, the events I receive are different. I tested this in a clean store that I personally set up, comparing it with the store I work for, and the results varied greatly.  \nI suspect the issue could be related to the classes assigned to each element in Shopify. They might not be set correctly, preventing me from accessing the necessary data layer variables. Has anyone else encountered this problem? Could you guide me toward a solution?  \nP.S.: I'm aware there are paid solutions to address this, but I'm keen on learning, even if it takes longer.  \n\n\nStore i'm trying to fix: [https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T02H6LBJ4R0-F062R8GGJQJ/image.png](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T02H6LBJ4R0-F062R8GGJQJ/image.png)\n\nMy own store: https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T02H6LBJ4R0-F062TMEDDAQ/image.png  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nMy company's websites use a lot of longwinded CF7 forms. I'm keen to be able to send the title of each form to GA as part of the event. With other forms I have used a datalayer variable with a bit of code like 'response.8.value' to extract it from the datalayer. However in some reason forms I have been looking at it seems that the title is not always in the same place and so I need something which can dynamically pull out that title from wherever it appears in the datalayer. For example in this particular form it would be the first value pair:\n\n    response: [\n        {\n          name: 'data_source_detail',\n          value: 'DTR-WEBINAR-Beacon-Discovery-June-2021'\n        },\n        {name: 'download_name', value: 'Webinar'},\n        {name: 'type', value: 'Live Webinar Registration'},\n        {\n\nBut in others it might be the second or third. How can I target it based on the name i.e. 'data\\_source\\_details'. Or is there a way I can capture it earlier in the process, perhaps with the successful form submit event?\n\nApologies if I've confused anyone - I may not have explained it all that well.

Do I need to manually put this code into the data layer on my website, or can Tag Manager do that for me? Also, if I'm understanding it correctly, I think the custom html code would look like:\n\n<script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || \\\\\\\\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\]; window.dataLayer.push({ 'event' : 'generate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_lead'}); </script>\n\nDoes that sound correct?

I'm working at a digital agency where i am the first and only one to start up their online advertising branch. I'm now at a point where i got multiple customers for which i have set up multiple advertising campaigns on different platforms (i.e. Google Ads, LinkedIn and Facebook/Instagram). \n\nThe problem i am facing now is that i have to set up conversion tracking for multiple platforms. I am doing most of the tracking with Google Tag Manager which seem to work properly for one platform. But the question is; when i set up tracking for organic visitors, visitors through Google Ads AND visitors through LinkedIn Ads which have the same conversions (call through website telephone link, filled in a contact form and a brochure download). How to properly set this up?\n\nRight now i'm setting up the same triggers with different tags. \n\nExample:\n\nConversion: Filled in contact form  \n1 tag for organic visitors which have filled in a contact form  \n1 tag for paid LinkedIn visitors which have filled in a contact form  \n1 tag for Google Ads visitors which have filled in a contact form  \nThe tags above do use the same trigger\n\nAnd so on for each type of conversion.. (brochure download 3x, clicks on phone numbers 3x, clicks on mailaddresses 3x, etc.) \n\nIs the above example the correct way?\n\nNext question is, does Google Tag Manager or the Tag from the advertising platform itself distinguish when a user came through an ad or when he/she didn't? So they don't fire multiple tags?",

The crime**\n\nThis Site had a GTM Server-Side container.\n\nI had the idea of passing some data I need through from the web container to the server-side container.\n\nSo I used a tag from the gallery, the '**Datatag from Stape.io**' as the provide many useful tags for server-side tagging :\n\n[https://imgur.com/chkJS2x](https://imgur.com/chkJS2x)\n\n[The github page for this tag.](https://github.com/stape-io/data-tag)\n\nThis tag was published exactly on 09/11.\n\nI was thinking this is just sending some datas to my ServerSide container.\n\nBut I in the tag details it was doing more than that.\n\n\n\n**3. The evidence**\n\nAside form the entire site being desindexed at a rapid pace, I noticed something weird on the Googlebot crawling reports.\n\nThe type of files crawled were odd. Usually the main file type is Html.\n\nBut now it was '**Other file type**' :\n\n[https://imgur.com/sn0qpnF](https://imgur.com/sn0qpnF)\n\nAnd we can see that the exact moment it rose :\n\n[https://imgur.com/T29JoRz](https://imgur.com/T29JoRz)\n\nWas when the html file type stopped being crawled.\n\n[https://imgur.com/36f90Md](https://imgur.com/36f90Md)\n\nAnd the date is matching when I published the Datatag.\n\nAnother evidence is form that moment, Google refused to crawl the website again (espcially **Google Smartphone Bot**).\n\nThe moment I removed the tag, the pages could be submitted again.\n\n  \n**4. The verdict**\n\nI am still waiting (and praying) the pages will get indexed again.\n\nIs this the real culprit?\n\nI went back to read the details of the Datatag and it can inject third-party cookie and make 'GET' requests to every URLs.\n\nIs this the cause? External scripts toying with **HTTP headers** and sending an alarming message to Google Bot?\n\nWhat's our take?",

I work at Cloudflare, one for the CDN providers for that feature and I am happy to answer questions you may have about implementation details on the orange cloud. \n\nSimply put, with that gateway, you'll onboard your site onto a CDN. Doing this means your visitor will see the CDN IP when accessing your site, not the one from your origin, your server hosting your site. With Google Tag Gateway, your libraries like gtag and GTM will get served from the CDN automatically instead of Google. So for the visitor, when loading your site,..gtm and gtag libraries y will look like they are loaded from your website (\"/gtm.js\" instead of \"tagmanager.google.com/gtm.js\"), most importantly under the same IP. \n\nThe practical implications are: 1/ limiting impact of ad blockers 2/ improved data collection through first party mode 3/ to a little extent (really little) performance gains. \n\nTBH, there's more in Cloudflare for you to augment your GTM tracking and soon Docker containers hosting will be supported which will make it the cheapest option to deploy Server-Side tagging.",

The fact that you are sending this data from the user's browser (without CDN / server-side), it means you are revealing their IP address to Google (by making the network call from their client (chrome/firefox/edge..), to Google/Meta etc.. This in itself, ALWAYS will include their IP address (this is the nature of the network calls). So there will ALWAYS be grounds to get in trouble.  \nWith CDN, and similar setups, you remove that last obstacle, but that still doesn't mean, you can start collecting PII (this needs to be researched it's own, as it can change from region to region and in the context, health niche usually has stricter definitions in Germany for example.  \n\n\nWell, this didn't turn into a sum-up, but I hope it helped😅  \nFeel free to ask any questions!🫡",

Both are under different domains. for the BE service, we don't even have full control over the domain.\n\nWe have server GTM up and running with Stape + cross-domain linking is enabled, installed GTM code on both the sites are nonce aware and pointing to the server container. even tho we are losing 40% - 50% of traffic source/channel/campaign data while they are leaving our website to the booking engine.

When did you set up your implementation in GTM originally?

Id take a look at their docs and make sure you're using the most up to date version. Probably simple, but just something to double check. \n\n  \nSynxis also tightened their CSP pretty recently, which means you absolutely need whitelisting to work or else nothing you do will help.\n\nAlso, if the browser were stripping params, you'd still have a record of the session under direct (UTMs should be fine though). Lots of browsers are blocking tracking (even server side). Depending on the hotel, usually between 50% - 80% of my direct sessions are from Apple.\n\n  \nWhat percentage of your total sessions are Direct or \"not set\"?\n\n  \nWe also merge our clients GA4 tag with their Google Ads tag which helps with tracking accuracy too.",

Mapping the ssGTM container to a subdomain does not circumvent ITP unless the first two octets of the IP adress match that of your core website. You would need to set up and serve requests from a path on the site to effeticely mitigate ITP.\n\n2. For your tagging server to be able to set cookies on the booking engine, the tagging server must be in at least a same-site relationship to the booking engine domain. That is, it must have its’ own tagging endpoint (tagmanager.synxis.com or synxis.com/tagmanager). If not, cookies will not be able to be set in the HTTP repsonse, and you will be left with the restricted JavaScript-set cookies.\n\nI would recommend setting this up, if your concern is ITP.\n\nTo your point about the referrer data. I find it unlikely that the URL is too long. But if that is the case, then you would need to find a way to cut down the length of the URL. You need the linking parameters to be present in the URL for the cookies to be set on the booking engine.\n\nTo be honest, there’s a lot of things that could contribute to the issue you’re having, so it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what the issue is without being able to debug the site. As a sanity check, could you confirm that you have added the booking engine to your domains in GA4 (I’m assuming we’re talking about GA4 here)? And have you checked if there may be any redirects that strip the query parameters when navigating to the booking engine?",

        "selftext": "So here is the scenario.  An order processor I am using supposedly requires that GA4 be setup in GTM with the following custom html tag rather than a Google Tag :\n\n    <script async src = \"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id={{ga4-tracking-id}}\"></script>\n    <script>\n    function gtag() {\n    dataLayer.push(arguments);\n    }\n    gtag('js', new Date());\n    if (!window.clsid) {\n        gtag('config', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', {\n            'cookie_flags': 'SameSite=None;Secure',\n            'page_referrer': '{{fsc-referrer}}',\n            'page_location': '{{fsc-url}}',\n        });\n        window.clsid = {\n            client_id: '',\n            session_id: ''\n        };\n        gtag('get', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', 'client_id', function(r) {\n            window.clsid.client_id = r\n        });\n        gtag('get', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', 'session_id', function(r) {\n            window.clsid.session_id = r\n        });\n    } else {\n        gtag('config', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', {\n            'client_id': window.clsid.client_id,\n            'session_id': window.clsid.session_id,\n            'cookie_flags': 'SameSite=None;Secure',\n            'page_referrer': '{{fsc-referrer}}',\n            'page_location': '{{fsc-url}}'\n        });\n    } \n    </script>\n\nThere reasoning for this isn't clear and after contacting them about it and if it was possible to just use a regular Google Tag they were clueless and of no help at all.\n\n{{fsc-referrer}} and {{fsc-url}} are not a big deal and I always have access to them.  Other than that the only variable used is {{ga4-tracking-id}} which I of course have also.\n\nThe reason I want to change over to a Google Tag instead of the above custom html is because of the built-in consent checks that come with the Google Tag - a custom html tag does not have these.  I want to take advantage of consent mode v2 where it can still track events even without consent given.\n\nLooking at the code I don't see a whole lot going on other than the custom cookie\\_flags, page\\_referrer, and page\\_location parameters.  client\\_id and session\\_id shouldn't even need to be set right because that will just happen automatically I would think, but then why the if/else depending on if window.clsid exists or not?\n\nI am just trying to make sense of the code and what it is actually accomplishing over just using a plain old Google Tag instead.  If it makes a difference the order processor's checkout pages, which is the most important part here because I want to track the checkout process and sales, is hosted on their domain and not mine.  The checkout process appears to load inline or within an iframe 'in' my own hosted html - that is accomplished with js.  I'll also add that they load my gtm on their side with my container id as well.",

From what I gather, it seems like the client and session ids stored in `window.clsid` are used by the custom link decorator function. This function is used to manually decorate the callback URLs of the storefront. \n\n\n\n\n**Why do they need a custom link decorator when the Google tag already handles this automatically?**\nThe Google tag linker only decorates `<a>` link elements by default. Since the checkout redirect is most likely handled programmatically (the user never clicks a link element to trigger the navigation) the linker parameters aren't appended to the destination URL. Passing client and session ids allows you to manually stitch the visit without using linker parameters.\n\n\n\n\nWhile this does get the job done there are a number of improvements that could be made here. It would for example be much more preferable to generate a linker parameter and pass that on instead of client and session ids. This would allow the Google tag to stitch the visit automatically instead of having to manually map the ids to the tag. Although I won't go into much detail on this and will try to focus is solving your issue as it is presented.\n\n\n\n\nAll of this code can be updated to work with the GTM Google Tag:\n\n1. Create two Google Tags. Tag A, which is blocked if `window.clsid` is defined and Tag B, which is blocked when `window.clsid` is `undefined`.\n\n\n2. Configure Tag A according to the config seen in the if-statement.\n\n\n3. Configure Tag B according to the config seen in the else-statement.\n\n\n4. Create a custom HTML tag with the following code:\n```html\n<script>\n    window.clsid = window.clsid || {\n        client_id: '',\n        session_id: ''\n    };\n    window.gtag = window.gtag || function gtag() {\n        dataLayer.push(arguments);\n    }\n    gtag('get', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', 'client_id', function(r) {\n        window.clsid.client_id = r\n    });\n    gtag('get', '{{ga4-tracking-id}}', 'session_id', function(r) {\n        window.clsid.session_id = r\n    });\n</script>\n```\n   5. Save the custom HTML tag without a trigger.\n\n   6. Go to Tag A and use tag sequencing to fire the custom HTML tag **after** Tag A has fired.\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration outlined above **should** provide the same results as the original code while allowing the use of the built-in Google Tag.",

I would have to do some tests to check that.\n\n\n> It is almost as if the gtag functions fail because I put some console.log() stuff in there to debug and nothing outputs.  \n\nEven though there is no asynchronous code in your custom HTML tag, the processing that occurs after calling gtag SET is asynchronous. This means that if you placed your console logs below the gtag function call they will always return nothing since the console logs will be executed before the gtag callback function is called. If you want to log the values manually, make sure to place your console logs inside the gtag callback function (same place where the client and session id are assigned).",

        "selftext": "I feel like I'm getting close to figuring all this out. Thanks for all the help thus far!\n\nI'm stuck on one last issue. My google tag events are firing...but not all of them. And I'm not sure why. It appears the google tag event binding isn't getting attached to everything it should be. \n\nThe quick outline of the page structure is this (pseudo-markup):\n\n    <head>\n    ...my gtag script..\n    </head>\n    <body>\n       <main>\n        ...initial elements...\n       </main>\n    </body>\n\nAfter some user interactions within 'initial elements' we swap out the contents of <main> dynamically so we now have:\n\n    <head>\n    ...my gtag script..\n    </head>\n    <body>\n       <main>\n        ...new elements...\n       </main>\n    </body>\n\nAll the elements in the initial page load get their event listeners attached properly via the google tag. \n\nWhen we swap out the content in main, the new content coming in has SOME of the events properly bound with the GTM event listener. But not all. It binds to the first handful of matching elements but then stops. \n\nInitially I thought that was pretty slick...seems that google tag logic watches for dynamically loaded content and re-scans any new dom objects it finds. But that it doesn't bind to ALL of the new content is what is confusing. \n\nAt first I thought it's because we load in some of the content in set to `display: none;` which makes some sense. Maybe google for whatever reason opts to ignore elements set to display: none;?\n\nBut even if I turn that logic off, it still doesn't bind to everything. So that didn't seem to be the culprit. \n\nIs there any reasons why the google tag logic won't bind my event listeners to all my elements? \n\nOr Is there a way to call the google tag logic to tell it \"hey, take another look at the DOM to see if you missed anything you should have bound to\" via my own code?

What GTM does is listen for all clicks on the document and then delegates events based on your conditions. Since the listener is attached globally, it can recognize clicks on dynamically loaded elements as well.\n\n\nOn the other hand, of the trigger is set to fire  on \"just link clicks\", GTM will attach listeners on link elements specifically.

        "selftext": "**Edit:** thanks all. Found the answer (as always) on Simo Ahava's blog: [https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/consent-mode-v2-google-tags/](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/consent-mode-v2-google-tags/)\n\n>If consent is *granted*, then any hits collected on the same page while consent was *denied* will get automatically **reprocessed** to have the granted status.\n\nHi all,\n\nI have a client with an on-page hardcoded gtag.js implementation of GA4. Since they have a global audience including EU, I have implemented a consent management platform (CookieBot) through Google Tag Manager. This seems to work in that all GA4 hits are fired in consent mode until the user provides consent. However, because all hits before consent approval are fired in consent mode, we end up without a starting page\\_view event on the original landing page, which can screw with source attribution if there's UTM tags etc present.\n\nSo I guess the question I have, is whether it is a good idea to re-fire the GA4 pageview tag through GTM after consent is granted? Or does the gtag consent update call already make sure that previous hits in the same session are re-processed without consent mode?\n\nThe complication I have, is that GA4 is installed on-page using gtag.js, whereas the CMP is installed through Google Tag Manager. So just blanket firing the pageview tag on the cookie\\_consent\\_update datalayer event will result in duplicates in cases where people have already provided consent.\n\nWhat would be a good solution here?",

That user\\_engagement event should have a gcs parameter = G111 (assuming the user granted full consent).\n\nGA4 backtracks from there to understand \"hey, this user consented.

So make sure your banner can’t get ignored.\n\nDon’t refresh the page on cookie consent or sent another page view, you will get duplicates.\n\nBut as mentioned above, add the Google config trough GTM instead of hardcoded.\n\n\nBTW, if the default consent state and the update comes from GTM, than you should check carefully whether GTM is loaded before the Google Tag fires.\n\nIn my opinion, use hardcoded CMP and use GA4 config within GTM. If a user has a ad blocker for example, it might block the GTM tracking script which will result in no cookie banner shown if it’s fired trough GTM. And if you’re fully compliant, which almost nobody is, without consent you couldn’t even load like a YouTube vid for example on your website because they automatically set cookies.",

        "selftext": "UPDATED BELOW\n\nHello- as the title suggests. \n\nDetails below, but I am trying to track just simple things: clicking on tel: and clicking on an outbound link. Healthcare field. I set it up the same way on both sites on the same date, but it's only working on one. GTM preview mode shows success on both sites. Details:\n\n- Wordpress sites\n- GTM is installed via the WP plugin called \"Site Kit\"\n- tag is GA4 Event\n- trigger is clicks - just links \"click URL starts with tel:\"\n- For both sites, it appears GA4 is installed within the Site Kit GA4 option AS WELL AS a container inside of GTM. It's the same on both. \n\nThe ONLY difference I can see is that in Site Kit inside WP, in the module where GTM gets installed, on the site where it's not working, at the bottom there is a message that says \"Placing two tags at the same time is not recommended.\" and I'm not sure what that means. Does that mean GTM is stalled twice? Is GA4 installed twice?\n\nI installed both of these on Friday, May 9. Again, verified that both were firing properly via tag manager preview. Didn't look all weekend. On Monday I verified the event was populating in GA4 on one site but not the other.  \n\nI'm stumped. Please help?\n\nUPDATE: So it's looking like the consent issues here are restricted on GA4 and it's not necessarily an issue with Site Kit. I had hoped to keep the tag as a GA4 event so I could track on all channels, but ultimately decided to create the tag as a Ads conversion and it's now recording just fine. Not ideal but better than nothing. Now that I'm at least getting that data to come in, I'll be more comfortable working with their team to find other solutions to track across all channels over time. \n\nMeanwhile, if I could just figure out why my Google Hosted 'All Conversions' aren't populating..... (see the [SECOND issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1kcg4s3/google_ads_location_extension_question_x2/) I lay out here). Thanks for all the assistance on this, y'all.",

                "body": "That is a frustrating and common issue with the constant changes to Google's tagging ecosystem.\n\nYou are correct in thinking that a single Google Tag from GA4 should theoretically handle tracking for both GA4 and Google Ads once they are linked.\n\nThis is Google's intended setup to simplify things.\n\nThe confusing part is that even when platforms are linked, you may still see that \"No Google Tag found in this container\" warning in the Google Ads conversion setup interface.\n\nThe message appears because the Google Ads interface expects to see a specific Google Tag (which used to be called the \"Global Site Tag\" or `gtag.js` with an \"AW-\" ID) deployed, even if you are using a combined Google Tag from GA4.\n\nWhile the single GA4-based Google Tag *should* be sufficient if you’ve correctly added Google Ads as a destination in the tag's configuration settings within the GA4 admin area or GTM, the Google Ads setup wizard often doesn't recognize the GA4 tag as its own dedicated tag, especially for new conversions.\n\nThis is often just a quirk or lag in the Google Ads interface’s detection mechanism, not necessarily an indication that your existing tracking is broken.\n\nYou have a few options, and the best practice is shifting toward server-side tracking for robustness.\n\nRegarding your question about two Google Tags, you generally *should not* need two separate ones (one for GA4 and one for Google Ads) if you're using the modern Google Tag setup and have properly linked the accounts and configured the GA4 Google Tag to send data to the Google Ads destination.\n\nHowever, some experienced users still opt to deploy a separate Google Tag for Google Ads in GTM, just to bypass this confusing interface error and ensure the Ads tag is explicitly present and configured with default parameters, which can be useful if you've heavily customized your GA4 tag.\n\nIf you decide to add a separate Google Ads Google Tag, just make sure both tags don't fire on all pages with the same configuration, which could lead to duplicate data or conflicts.\n\nNow, let's look at the more future-proof solution: Server-Side Tagging.\n\nThe combination of the Google Ads API, Google Analytics Data API, Google Tag Manager, and a service like Stape provides a significant upgrade to your tracking setup.\n\nHere’s how this works and why it’s a better solution:\n\nServer-side tagging involves moving your tracking tags from the user’s web browser (client-side) to a cloud environment (server-side), typically hosted via a custom domain.\n\nYour website sends a single data stream to your server-side GTM container, and *that* container then distributes the data to Google Ads, Google Analytics, and other vendors.\n\nUsing the Google Ads API and Google Analytics Data API alongside your GTM and Stape setup allows you to send data directly from your server to the respective Google platforms.\n\nThis is superior because it significantly improves data quality by making your tracking more resilient to client-side issues, such as ad blockers and Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) features in browsers like Safari, which often block or shorten the lifespan of the third-party cookies used in traditional client-side Google Ads tracking.\n\nStape, or a similar service, simplifies the hosting and management of your server-side GTM container, which is often the most complex part of the setup.\n\nIt allows your server-side environment to act as a first-party collection point, meaning the tracking cookies are set from your domain, which browsers treat more favorably.\n\nThis can help you capture more reliable `gclid` (Google Click ID) values for attribution.\n\nMoreover, server-side tagging facilitates powerful data enrichment and compliance.\n\nYou can use this setup to better implement Enhanced Conversions for Google Ads, which involves hashing and sending customer-provided data (like email addresses) directly to Google Ads for more accurate conversion matching.\n\nYou can also implement your cookie consent logic more robustly, ensuring that data is only sent to vendors after consent is granted, and you can manipulate the data before it leaves your server to maintain privacy or enrich it with crucial business information, such as calculating product margin before sending the conversion value.\n\nWhile the \"No Google Tag found\" error is annoying, it presents a good opportunity to move to this server-side architecture, which will future-proof your tracking and provide better data quality for optimization.\n\nYou would set up your web GTM container to send data to the server container, and then use a server-side Google Ads Conversion Tracking tag (and `Standard Events` like `purchase` for GA4) within the server container to handle the conversion reporting to Google Ads.",

        "selftext": "Update: was just on the phone with Google Support (got a hold of somebody via the Google Ads support) and they said that for some reason my debug view in GA4 is just not working properly but analytics IS actually tracking everything so.. I guess I'm good lol. Still a bit strange but at least I didn't do anything incorrectly haha.\n\n\\----\n\nSo I've set up a bunch of tags to track a variety of events. The confusing thing is that they all fire in preview (and during that also in the GA4 debug view). When I go to the same pages to trigger the same tags, tag assistant confirms that those tags were fired BUT debug view does NOT show any events. Not even the page views from my GA4 Config tag for page initializations. My website is on Wix (planning on moving to Wordpress in the near future).\n\nWix: under marketing integrations, I've connected Google Tag Manager **and** Google Tag. I've tested disabling the Google Tag option here and that made no difference. I also disabled the cookie consent banner briefly, again no events sent in debug view.\n\nThis is how the tag is set up (I followed Analytics Mania's video most recent video on this):  \n\\- Tag configuration: Google Tag  \n\\- Tag ID: the data stream ID from GA4 (triple checked that it's the right ID)  \n\\- triggering: initialization - all pages\n\nGranted, I'm very new to GTM and GA4 so I must have obviously missed something but I've been racking my brain and can't figure out what.\n\nI double checked the data filters and made sure to switch off the \"internal traffic\" filter. I do have a cookie consent banner on my website but even after accepting that, the event still doesn't show in GA4.\n\nI don't have any ad blockers on my browser (Google Chrome). I downloaded Firefox and went to my home page, still no page\\_view event shown in the GA4 Debug View (same for the Admin Debug View).\n\nI've also read that debug view can be delayed, so I've waited to see what it shows. Nothing. Whereas when I'm in preview, the event usually shows up after a minute or so.\n\nIf tag assistant is confirming the tag fired and the event was sent, something must be wrong with GA4, right? Honestly, my brain feels fried from trying to figure this out all day. I just don't get why it works in preview but not outside of that? (again, I'm very new to this stuff. Forgive me if I'm missing something obvious here)\n\nAny help is highly appreciated. I want to run Google Search Ads soon but I want to make sure everything's tracked properly.",

                "body": "It's advanced in the sense that you'll need to have experience debugging in GTM, using Console to find and inspect custom dataLayer events, and most likely how to create a global event settings variable and add it to your Google Tag Configuration tag if it exists.  In my experience, data like page type or logged in status are configured to send with EVERY even and not just page view. To do that, you'll need to configure your Global Event Settings to include those dataLayer variables then add that to your Google Tag Configuration. If your implementing via a plug in that automatically sends page views, and there's no Google Tag Configuration in GTM, etc., you may not be able to add parameters the page\\_view event, so before anything, you need to know how GA tracking is currently implemented.\n\nYou need to know:\n\n\\- How page views triggered - either by a custom page view tag or automatically via your Google Tag Configuration - and what event pushes page type, logged in status, etc. to the dataLayer,  \n\\- how to confirm the dataLayer variable exists in GTM, and how to confirm there's associated data in dataLayer,  \n\\- how to add dataLayer variable either to an existing page view tag or to your Global Event Settings variable and Google Tag Configuration tag\n\nThe simplest scenario (not including creating and configuring Global Event Settings and Google Tag config), assuming there's a page view tag, page type is being pushed to the dataLayer. (If there's no page view tag, I'd stop before doing the following to assess the best way forward):\n\n1. Open GTM\n2. Create a new workspace 'add page type variable' or use the default workspace\n3. Search for a GA4 page view tag and its trigger.\n4. Navigate to 'Variables' in GTM and in your user-defined variables, search for a page type variable (e.g., DL - page\\_type, DL - PageType, etc.). If it exists, note the dataLayer variable name in the configuration  - this is the variable you'll look for. If no page type variable exists, you'll need to identify the event pushing page type on the site and use the page type parameter to create a new variable in GTM later.\n5. Click \"Preview\" top right and when your site loads, look at the \"tag assistant\" tab - the events that are pushed to the dataLayer are listed on the left in the order they're fired. In the main part of the page, you'll see tabs for Tags, Variables, DataLayer, Consent, and Console.\n6. In the left list of events, look for the event that you identified as the trigger for your page view tag in step 3 and click on it.\n7. If you found a page type dataLayer variable in GTM: Click the 'Variables' tab in the main part of the page and look for that variable. Hopefully there's a value there for page type. If you didn't find a page type parameter in GTM, locate the event that's pushing the page type data that you want to send in a new dataLayer variable in GTM. You can do so by opening Console in dev tools in chrome, typing 'dataLayer' on command line at the bottom, and looking for all dataLayer events. Note the page type parameter in the event - likely something like 'pageType = \"homepage\"'\n8. Go back to GTM, look at your page view tag. If there's no page type variable, you'll need to create a new dataLayer variable (in Variables in GTM) using 'pageType' or whatever parameter you just identified in the dataLayer pushed to your site. Add it to your tag - call it page-type and select the existing page type variable or the one you just created.\n9. Click preview again, trigger your page view tag, and confirm that the page type parameter is present with valid data.\n\nThat's a the easiest scenario assuming you have a page view tag and that the site is pushing a value for page type to the dataLayer either via a CMS plug in, or custom dataLayer event, etc.\n\nConfiguring Global Event Settings to send data in every event will require a little more configuration, but you'll still need to have done everything above.\n\nAnd you need to register and new parameters in GA4's custom definitions as event-scoped or they'll only be available in BigQuery exports and not GA4 online.\n\nAlso, dimensions are not registered to a session - only events. You can segment on sessions that include an event, but there's no session scope in the traditional sense even though it seems like it.",

        "selftext": "Hey, I have multiple integrations on my website, I want to exclude that specific tag for specific integration to fire on a particular IP address. There is no help from YouTube, there is a blog, but it is not working. Can anyone help me with this?\n\nEdit:\n\nI followed this COA:\n\n# Step 1: Create Custom HTML IP Addresses tag\n\n* Visit [tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com/) and log in with your account.\n* Choose the appropriate account and container you want to configure.\n* Click \"Tags\" on the left menu and select \"New Tag.\n* For example, name the tag as \"IP Exclusion.\"\n* Choose \"Tag Configuration\" and select \"Custom HTML.\n* Paste the following JavaScript code that retrieves the IP addresses and forwards them to the dataLayer:htmlCopy code\n* Select \"all pages\" as the trigger.\n\n\n\n    <script>\n    (function getIpAddress() {\n      fetch('https://api.ipify.org')\n        .then(function(response) {\n          return response.text();\n        })\n        .then(function(ip) {\n          window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n          window.dataLayer.push({\n            event: 'IPAddressEvent',\n            IPAddress: ip\n          });\n        });\n    })();\n    </script>\n\n# Step 2: Creating a Custom Variable\n\nWith the tag and trigger ready, the next step is to create a custom variable that captures the IP address from the data layer.\n\n* In Google Tag Manager, go to \"Variables\" via the left sidebar.\n* Scroll to 'User-defined Variables' and click 'New'.\n* Give the variable the name \"IPAddress.\"\n* Choose \"Variable Configuration.\n* Select \"Data Layer Variable\" as the type.\n* Under \"Data Layer Variable Name,\" enter \"IPAddress\" as used in the tag.\n* Click 'Save' to save the variable.\n\nNow that we have the custom variable \"IPAddress\" set up, here are the steps to use this variable in a new trigger that activates only under certain conditions, and how to then add this trigger as an exception to the Google Tag to exclude specific IP addresses.\n\n# Step 3: Set up Trigger for Specific IP Lockout\n\n* Go to \"Triggers\" in the Google Tag Manager dashboard and select \"New Trigger.\n* Choose the \"Initialization\" type.\n* Name the trigger, for example, \"Exclude Specific IP.\"\n* Set the condition so that this trigger activates only if the \"IPAddress\" variable equals a specific IP address you want to exclude. Replace \"\\[Fill in IP Address\\]\" with the actual IP address you want to exclude.\n\n# Step 4: Add the Trigger as an Exception to the Google Tag\n\n* Go to 'Tags' and select the Google Tag\n* In the 'Triggering' section of the tag configuration, add the newly created 'Exclude Specific IP' trigger as an exception.\n* This ensures that the tag is not triggered when the site visitor has the specified IP address.\n\nYou have now ensured that certain ip addresses are not sent to the server container. Save all changes and use Preview mode to ensure that the tag is not firing for the specified IP address. Publish the changes after you have verified that everything is working correctly.\n\nSource: [https://taggrs.io/en/anonymize-ip-addresses-google-tag-manager/](https://taggrs.io/en/anonymize-ip-addresses-google-tag-manager/)",

                "body": "That's a super common and frustrating issue, so you're definitely not alone in seeing these attribution discrepancies.\n\nIt sounds like you have a solid server-side setup, which is the best foundation, but let's dive into the likely reasons why GA4 is being more liberal and what you can do about it.\n\nThe core reason GA4 is attributing more liberally, especially without the `gclaw` cookie, is that GA4 uses Identity Resolution and Conversion Modeling which the standard Google Ads Tag does not.\n\nThe Google Ads Tag primarily relies on first-party cookies, specifically the `gclaw` (Google Click ID) and other click IDs, to link the ad click to the conversion.\n\nIf the `gclaw` cookie is blocked, expires, or the user switches devices, the Google Ads Tag can lose that signal.\n\nGA4, however, employs a user-ID (if implemented), Google Signals (cross-device/cross-platform), and device ID (client ID on the web) to create a more holistic user journey.\n\nWhen it can't observe a direct link, its Data-driven attribution model uses machine learning to model conversions, estimating conversions that would have occurred but for privacy restrictions, linking them back to an ad interaction even without the direct `gclaw` proof.\n\nThis explains why GA4 attributes conversions to ads even without the cookie and without strong UTM parameters - it's using internal signals or modeling to make the connection.\n\nYour observation that GA4 attributes via client ID (or Google Signals) and shows higher numbers is a direct result of this broader, modeled approach, which is why your organic conversions aren't being reported in Google Ads; Google Ads is only concerned with Google-paid channel interactions and their associated conversion value.\n\nRegarding which method to trust, generally, you should use the Google Ads Tag/API data for optimizing Google Ads performance.\n\nGoogle Ads is a self-attributing platform, meaning its data is what your bidding algorithm sees and uses.\n\nFor accurate ad performance, especially for bidding, the Google Ads Tag (or its server-side equivalent) is the primary source of truth for the platform itself.\n\nYou should use the GA4 data for a broader cross-channel understanding of the user journey, how Google Ads is assisting other channels, and a full-funnel view.\n\nThe best practice for handling these discrepancies and ensuring the most accurate data for Google Ads is to transition your tracking to include the Google Ads Conversions API (CAPI), implemented server-side.\n\nA great solution for this is to use Google Tag Manager (server-side container) hosted on a service like Stape.io.\n\nThis setup is superior because you send the conversion data *directly* from your server to Google Ads using the API.\n\nHere's why Google Ads CAPI + Google Tag Manager + Stape.io is the solution:\n\n* Bypasses Browser Restrictions: By sending the data directly from your server (via Stape's managed cloud environment), you bypass many client-side issues like ad blockers and aggressive browser cookie policies that affect the client-side Google Ads Tag.\n\n* Maximizes `gclaw` Preservation: In the server environment, you have more control over the first-party cookies, and Stape's Cookie Keeper feature can help extend the life of essential identifiers like `gclaw` beyond what the browser might allow, improving the match rate.\n\n* Enhanced Conversions: The server-side Google Ads tag allows you to easily implement Enhanced Conversions.\n\nThis means you can securely send hashed first-party user data (like email address) along with the conversion.\n\nThis user data is used by Google to significantly improve the match rate between an ad click and a conversion, especially across devices or when the `gclaw` is unavailable.\n\nThis is crucial for minimizing the data loss the standard Google Ads Tag is experiencing.\n\nSingle Source of Truth (Server): With this setup, your server is the central point for the `purchase` event, and it reliably dispatches the data to *both* GA4 and Google Ads, reducing the risk of one platform failing to track the event correctly while the other succeeds.\n\nIf you implement the Google Ads tag server-side and activate Enhanced Conversions, you'll see your Google Ads conversion numbers rise and the discrepancies narrow, giving you a more complete picture of your ad performance directly within the platform.",

        "author": "CulturalAtmosphere34",
        "id": "1dn0nwu",
        "selftext": "Hi all - I'm new to Tag Manager and have been able to get most of the setup done without any trouble. The one thing that I can not seem to figure out is how to track conversions from HubSpot form submissions, and post-submission page visits.\n\nSome background info:\n\n* We use SquareSpace for our website.\n* We use HubSpot forms (ex. demo request) with the form's HTML script embedded within each of the applicable pages on our website.\n* Tag Manager is installed on the website and is working as expected.\n* When a form is submitted, we use the HubSpot URL redirect option to land the submitter on a thank you page.\n   * Our thank you page url's are unique to each of the forms submitted (ex. trial request = \"mysite.com/thank-you-trial\")\n* I have tried Page View (page url contains), History Change (page url contains), and even a Custom HTML listener event trigger following [this guide](https://fizzypop.nz/digital-marketing-insights/track-hubspot-form-submissions-with-google-tag-manager-and-analytics/).\n   * The Custom HTML listener event trigger is the *only* of the 3 options that actually registers a 'generate\\_lead' event.\n\nThe issue I'm facing is once the form is submitted, the Google Tag is not being fired on the thank you page that the website visitor is redirected to. My original thought was that the form submission is essentially \"ending\" the visitor's session, and then another session would begin starting on the thank you page. But in reality, it doesn't. But then if I click to another page, the tag seems to reconnect itself and fires for all following activities.\n\nWhen I use Tag Assistant on the thank you page url, the Google Tag fires as expected, so that removes the question of if the tag is on the page or not. But when I submit the form using the process that a real website visitor would, the tag is not fired on the thank you page after the form submission event. Even using the GA4 DebugView shows nothing after the form submission. Tag Assistant is also disconnected when redirected to the thank you page via the form submission.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a timing issue of some sort, but it's truly throwing me for a loop. Has anybody experienced the same scenario and been able to figure out the reason behind the tag not firing? Thank you in advance for any potential solutions, I genuinely appreciate any ideas!\n\n\n\n**\\*\\* UPDATE \\*\\***\n\nI spoke with someone from Google's Tag Manager team and they indicated that when a HubSpot form is submitted, the redirect page that is established in the HS form's settings is loading *on the page the form lives on (????)*. This prevents the tag from firing when using the \"page URL contains\" firing criteria. Doesn't make sense to me since the URL clearly changes, but what do I know?\n\nThe only solution, per that rep, is what other's have already referenced and what is shown in the custom HTML listener event trigger guide (hyperlinked above).\n\nFor whatever it's worth if you're using Google Ads and want to track the conversions, this is how they told me to set it up:\n\n1. In Ads, create your Conversion Action, for every form, and find your Conversion ID and Conversion Label.\n2. In Tag Manager, create a tag for every form.\n   1. Tag Type = Google Ads Conversion Tracking\n      1. Put in the Conversion ID and Conversion Label for the applicable Conversion Action you created in Ads.\n3. In Tag Manager, create a Trigger for every form.\n   1. Trigger Type = Custom Event\n   2. Event Name = \"hubspot-form-success\"\n   3. Trigger Fires on 'Some Custom Events'\n      1. Page URL contains \\[the url the form lives on\\].\n4. Connect the Trigger(s) to the applicable Tags, publish changes and then perform a test submission using the Preview tool to verify the Ads Conversion Tag fires.",

Depending on your use case, it should work.\n\nThat said, I had a call with Google's Technical Team last week regarding issues with Google Ads conversion tracking. This issue came up as a result due to what the rep explained as \"the data flow is essentially breaking once the form is submitted\" and the rep was stumped since the thank you pages are tagged properly.\n\nHe was going to do some internal work with his team to try to figure it out, and I have a reconnect call set up for tomorrow. If I'm able to get any more info around the reason this requires a workaround in the first place or if Google provides an alternative solution, I'll make sure to come back here and provide an update.\n\nIf you're not using Ads, the workaround will likely give you the info you need.

The actual tags and any code related to them is not bundled within the published container. What you are seeing in the container code is simply and object that houses a minimal amount of information about the paused tag.\n\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n`{ function: '__paused', vtp_originalTagType: 'html', tag_id: 5 }`\n\n\n\nThere are only 3 pieces of information related to the paused tag:\n\n1. Tag type: `function: '__paused'`\n2. Tag type when unpaused: `vtp_originalTagType: 'html'`\n3. Tag ID: `tag_id: 5`\n\n\n---\n\n\nSo regarding your statements, in reverse order:\n\n>3. You're basically serving dead weight to your users\n\nSince the object serves no purpose for you users this statement is technically true. Although, the object in my example only takes up around 60 bytes of data. I just created a fresh container and published it. The size of the bundled container script is just above 65 kb in size.  That means I would have to fill my container up with over a 1000 paused tags in order to even touch the size of the container code. Keeping in mind that an actual production container can easily reach double the size of an empty container I'd say this tiny object is completely negligible.\n\n\n\n>2. It's affecting your site's performance and user experience\n\nFirstly, loading an extra 60 bytes of data on top of a script that is +65 kb will not be noticable in any type of regard and especially not for the end-user. Second, considering that this is simply a static object, i.e. it is not executing any type of code it will affect neither website performance or the end-user experience in any negative way.\n\n\n\n>1. Your container file is bigger than it needs to be\n\nThis is the interesting one because behind this statement lies the question \"what purpose does this object serve?\". I can't claim to have the answer but my educated guess is that it is included for the sole purpose of making it easier for Preview Mode to show you your paused tags in the preview interface.\n\n\n\nYou see, the GTM API offers no functionality to make a request for \"all paused tags from X container\". Instead, options are:\n\n1. Fetch the container configuration (which only includes a list of Tag ID's)\n2. Fetch the configuration of one specific tag (using the Tag ID)\n\n\n\nSo, if no paused tag ID's were available in the published code, in order to show you information about paused tags, preview mode would have to:\n\n1. Make a request for the container configuration.\n2. Extract all Tag ID's from the configuration.\n3. Make an individual request **for every single tag** included in the container configuration (**paused and unpaused**).\n4. Filter the list of all tags based on paused status.\n5. Present the results.\n\n\n\nAs it is right now, all that needs to happen is:\n\n1. Make a request for one specific tag using the paused tags ID.\n2. Present the results.\n\n---\n\nExcuse the wall of text, kinda got ahead of myself here. ( :\n\n\nOh yeah, and u/DigitalStefan, u/StefanAtWork , don't be fooled, you were indeed correct stating that:\n\n>Published containers minify a lot of things and paused tags are dropped entirely",

So you agree that  paused tags are still present in the production container :) And yes, as I have quite clearly expressed in my original post and as you confirmed, there's only three pieces of information available. Still, it is there, for no clear purpose.     \n  \nAs for the impact on the performance, it's not solely about the weight of the container file unfortunately. The way GTM works is that, every time a tracked interaction happens on the site, all predicates and rules are checked in, sequentially, through a for loop. If you pay attention to the detail, you'll see that paused tags are still checked everytime their trigger is true, even though they will never fire. So whatever minimal this operation can be here, the browser is still 1/ blocking and 2/ wasting cpu time inspecting useless objects. This has an impact on performance, and you would be surprised how much it can damage your UX and CWV (I have had multiple realizations of this when migrating GTM containers to Zaraz, gaining 40-60% on TBT, TTI and FCP). I agree with your example: it's a really small object, which is just a tiny fraction of the total weight of the file, especially from a fresh, empty container. Yet, in my experience, what I have seen, and keep seeing through tagstack daily, scanning random corporates sites, is containers filled with hundreds of tags, of which a a good few dozen are paused, for months.\n\n>  \nif no paused tag ID's were available in the published code, in order to show you information about paused tags, preview mode would have to:\n\nI doubt that this is the design choice Google engineers made to be honest, because prod and preview environments are two different things. For instance, tag names are not present in the production container file, yet you can see them in preview mode. It's because preview mode go tap information somewhere else than just from the production container file. Public APIs are one thing, but Google also use their own private APIs to grab and manage information in GTM containers, especially when in preview mode. \n\n Love the conversation by the way, really cool to see so much engagement and passion around that topic.",

How are you handling consent?\n\n\n\n\n> What is the difference between doing individual conversion API setups for these platforms to complement our client-side tagging, vs. setting up a server-side tagging solution and using that instead to connect to Meta & these other ads platforms? \n\n\nTime, complexity and cost. By all means, a direct integration with each individual API is great but everytime you need to make a change or add something new you need to involve a developer.\n\n\nUsing a centralized solution means that the developer can manage the quality of a single API (the one to your tagging server) instead of however many for each individual vendor you want to integrate.\n\n\nAdditionally, a dedicated tagging server allows you to do stuff other than exclusively forward requests to vendors. You can set cookies and serve scripts in a first party context, modify requests, enrich data, etc.",

Conflict with website CSP (Content security Policy)\n5. also, apparently, the Google Ads tags can sometimes simply \"look that way\" despite them working correctly.

I’ve tested in incognito mode, cleared caches, and confirmed that other Measurement IDs (e.g., `G-PGF88SQQTV -` [`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-PGF88SQQTV`](https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-PGF88SQQTV) ) work without issues.\n\nThis URL needs to be accessible for Pixel Manager for WooCommerce to be able to report to the GA4 ID. It's currently unable to reach it, because it 404's for some reason.\n\nSince this happens even when manually accessing the link, it seems to be a backend issue with this specific ID.

        "selftext": "I have a tag that I want to run that is dependent on another, so I've set it up as a sequenced firing after the dependency tag. But, I also don't want to fire my tag until DOM Ready triggers. However, the dependency tag it is sequenced after, fires earlier than DOM Ready.\n\nCould I have the tag both sequenced and give it its own DOM Ready trigger, and will it fire once both are true? Or what happens when both types of triggering exist?\n\nSummary:\n\n* **Tag A** \\- Fires at *Page View*\n   * **Tag B** \\- Dependent on Tag A and should not fire until after Tag A, also needs to wait for *DOM Ready*, which is later than the Page View event.\n\nWhen I Google this, the AI response suggests that yes it will fire once both are true, but then the first result suggests the opposite, that tags that are sequenced ignore any of their own triggers (post from 2014).\n\nFurthermore, the heading right above the sequenced tag in the Triggers window says \"Your tag will also fire right after these tags\", which implies to me an \"Or\" condition, not \"And\" condition, and also does not imply that existing triggers will be ignored.\n\nTrying to do some GTM Preview testing and it seems like it fires twice, which would be an \"Or\" condition.",

However, I've noticed that some recordings are being generated for URLs like:\n\n* `/en/uk/page/***`\n* `/he/il/page/****`\n\nThis behavior is puzzling because these URLs do not match the specified condition I set.\n\nSome additional details:\n\n1. My website generates millions of pageviews daily, but only a very small subset of these seem to erroneously trigger the tag.\n2. When I debug these problematic URLs in Google Tag Manager (GTM), the tag does not appear to fire, as expected.\n3. Despite this, recordings for these unrelated URLs still appear in Hotjar.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the issue may not be with Hotjar itself but could be related to other tags behaving unpredictably. I’m worried that other tags on my site might also be firing when they shouldn't.\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar issue or have insights on what could be causing this? Could there be a conflict or misconfiguration in GTM that's causing tags to fire intermittently?\n\nAny advice or suggestions on how to troubleshoot and ensure tags fire only under the correct conditions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

You can do this the most simple way by creating a trigger that checks \"is the hostname the one I expect it to be\" and then use that as an exception trigger on every tag, so that the tag is blocked if the hostname is incorrect.\n\n**If you are currently sending data to GA4, pull up a standard report, add a secondary dimension of hostname and look for those spam domains.

                "body": "You're trying to track when a user clicks on one thing, and then on another, right?\n\nYou can't track two clicks in a single event. You can either create an event tag for each click with its own trigger, or create a single tag with multiple triggers and distinguish the clicks in reports by adding dynamic variables as parameters. For example, the built in {{click text}} variable captures the string/text of what ever you're clicking on. The ChatGPT suggestion is basically that, but generic click and linkClick triggers cast very wide nets. It's a good solution in some cases. Depending on traffic, it's also a ton of events that impact site performance. But you cast smaller nets by targeting all clicks on a specific part of the page.\n\nI don't know why tag sequencing has been suggested. Tag sequencing is used when you want to make sure one event (e.g., a click) fires before or after another event (e.g., another click). It's only there to prioritize the order in which tags/events fire when they all fire more or less together (e.g., custom html tag scripts). It's commonly used to make sure a script runs first to generate data or something else another tag needs to collect. It has nothing to do with your problem.\n\nSomeone suggested BigQuery, and that's an option if a. you're firing events already and b. you're ingesting the raw data and are able to SQL query events and timestamps to reliably create your sequence. It's not easy, but probably provides the most reliable data. But again, you can't magically query click event data in BigQuery that doesn't exist. You still need to create the necessary event tag(s) and triggers and collect/send the data to GA4. In the linked BQ solution, the provided SQL query doesn't sequence anything. Do you see anything in the query having anything to do with when the events occurred? It's a bad solution and it shouldn't have been suggested.\n\nChatGPT's suggestion is not uncommon; in fact, depending on your event limits, counts, traffic, etc., it can be a very valuable \"fall back\" solution that collects data you don't know you need or want yet. Yes, you're collecting every [gtm.click](http://gtm.click) or gtm.linkClick or both but if you configure the tag/event with dynamic variables like {{click text}}, {{click element}}, {{click URL}}, etc., it may provide all the data you ever need for analysis. Again, the single tag solution is common. Creating a tag/event for every single click event is far far less common because it's ridiculous. Also, you don't have to send events for every click on your site. You can target every link click in, for example, your nav.\n\nRE: tracking the sequence of 'corporate' to 'employment', just create a sequenced segment in GA4 based the sequence you're interested (click 1 then click 2); you can also specify a time-based condition to only include sessions/events where Users clicked on 'employment' within a number of seconds or minutes of clicking on 'corporate.' It's that easy. Sorry, but this is the whackiest thread of solutions I've probably ever seen on Reddit. RUN! LOLOLOL.",

Even if you hit their free quota of one million events/month, the cost for an additional million events is $5. It is the best and the easiest way to set up server-side tracking if your website is already on Cloudflare.\n\nIf you don't want AdBlockers blocking Zaraz like they block GTM, change the path of the Initialization script, Main script, and Track endpoint on settings > endpoints. The default path has \"zaraz\" in it, and Ublock Origin uses it to block Zaraz. Don't be a fool and change the path of the track endpoint to /track.js or /tracking.js.\n\nSafari found out that people were using a subdomain of the domain that the user has requested to set cookies, and now they are limiting the cookie expiration date to 7 days if the IP address of your server-side tracking domain (ss.yourdomain.com) does not match the first half of the IP address of the domain that the user has requested (yourdomain.com). People are now using Cloudflare Workers and reverse proxy to load sGTM on the domain that the user has requested.\n\nThe thing is: you will end up having a Cloudflare account, and if your domain is proxied through Cloudflare (orange cloud on) and you're using Zaraz, it will be easier to avoid this Safari limit (in theory) than setting up a reverse proxy.\n\nThis is better explained: [https://www.cookiestatus.com/safari/#cname-cloaking](https://www.cookiestatus.com/safari/#cname-cloaking)\n\nCons of Zaraz:\n\n1). A while ago, I searched for what Simo Ahava thought of Zaraz because it seemed too good to be true, and what he said was:\n\n\"SGTM means ownership and control. You have full freedom to configure the GTM proxy however you wish, using custom templates to create additional data flows and so forth. Further, you own the server stack (under provisions of the cloud service you use).\n\nIf you want ease of use, a service like Zaraz might indeed be the solution. But 'easy' isn't necessarily a virtue when it comes to the complexity of data flows and especially the governance thereof...\"\n\nFor me and my clients, this isn't an impeding factor.\n\n2). Google's Enhanced Conversions and Offline Conversions.\n\nIf you want to send EC using Zaraz, you will need a developer token with basic access and send this conversion through the Google Ads API. This is Google's fault, in part, and Zaraz is working to solve it, but I still don't know how they'll solve it.\n\nYou can send Offline Conversions without a developer token with basic access if you are using Stape because they have a workaround for it.\n\n3). To set up server-side tracking with GTM and sGTM, you have a bunch of videos, courses, and blog posts teaching you about it. To set up server-side tracking with Zaraz, you have their documentation, their discord, and less than 10 videos teaching about it, and nothing else.\n\n4). To be fully GDPR compliant, the data of EU users must not leave European servers. You can achieve this with Cloudflare using their data localization suite. The data localization suite is available for enterprise users of Cloudflare, and the enterprise plan costs $200.\n\nIf your client is a medium to large company and they use Cloudflare, they are likely already on the enterprise plan. If your client is a small company and wants to comply with cookie laws, I recommend Stape.\n\nMore info: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/keep-analytics-tracking-data-in-the-eu-cloudflare-zaraz/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/keep-analytics-tracking-data-in-the-eu-cloudflare-zaraz/)\n\nUnobvious pros of Zaraz:\n\n1). Workers Variables and Context Enricher. It's not worth explaining it.\n\n2). Only one account is needed for server-side tracking (Zaraz), database (D1 database), and automation (Workers). If you have clients, you know it's a pain to ask them to create accounts, set up billing, and share partial access to your account for the tools you need to use.",

I have a few questions regarding its implementation:\n\n1. Is it primarily used for traffic pass-through or redundancy control? i.e whatever payload comes, its passes to Google's respective product/service, like that GA4 one by default.\n2. Should we set up the server-side Conversion Linker tag, or is the client-side version sufficient?\n3. Is it necessary to configure both client-side and server-side tags together?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any insights or guidance. Thank you!",

Furthermore but think you should never use the same conversion label in both client and server GTM. Since this might result in duplication in the conversation count.\n\nYou could start with a dual setup where you use both client and server tags. Meaning you create two conversions labels for the same action. You create a client tag with a unique label and a server tag with a unique label. In this setup you also create a conversion linker in both client and server.\n\nOnce you have enough data to validate your setup you should pause/delete your client GTM tags, to reduce the load on the client since this will be done through your server GTM.",

The variables in GTM preview for the event are correct, and what should be passed with the tags.\n\n\n\nHowever - the tags are passing a contents array that includes multiple products.  Two datalayer events later is a \"view\\_item\\_list\" event, and the datalayer there contains the products that are being passed.  Trying to figure out why the tags on the \"view\\_item\" event, when the variables on that event are correct, would be passing variables from a datalayer event that happens after that (the view\\_item\\_list) event.\n\n\n\nThe only consideration is that the datalayer events aren't setup ideally on the website side (can't change it so have to work with it), and both \"view\\_item\" and \"view\\_item\\_list\" occur before the \"Container Loaded\" event where most \"All Pages\" base codes fire.  So we used tag sequencing to ensure the base tags for Meta, Google, etc. fired before the view\\_item/ViewContent event.\n\n\n\nStill not sure why when the trigger and variables and datalayer are all correct for the tag, it would pull values from another event that happens AFTER it.

        "id": "184dbcq",
        "selftext": "Hi folks, I've been trying to implement consent mode with OneTrust & GTM, but running into a few issues.\n\n**My setup is as follows**:\n\n1. Tags set up in GTM (UA, GA4, Google Ads, Bing, Meta)\n2. Triggers set up via page view URL on all relevant tags. conversion actions etc\n3. Consent mode enabled in GTM and tags configured with 'no additional consent required'\n4. Consent mode enabled in OneTrust & Auto blocking turned off.\n5. OneTrust script is hardcoded to the site rather than being set up in GTM, and the OneTrust script is the first one that loads up on my site. We are not using a CMP Template.\n\nFurther info:\n\n**I've added this script before GTM code on my site head:**\n\n    <script>\n  // Define dataLayer and the gtag function.\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\n  // Default ad_storage to 'denied'.\n  gtag('consent', 'default', {\n    'ad_storage': 'denied'\n  });\n</script>\n\n**And added this to the body:** \n\n    <script>\n  function consentGranted() {\n    gtag('consent', 'update', {\n      'ad_storage': 'granted'\n    });\n  }\n</script>\n\n**Further Info**\n\nIn preview mode, I can see my GTM tags fire, but in the consent section in GTM preview. Ad\\_storage is set to denied as expected for default.\n\nOnce I click on 'accept all' on my site's cookie banner, the 'ad\\_storage' is still denied, meaning the user consent is not updating on GTM.\n\nOn the network tab in chrome, I can see GSC: 100, no matter if consent is given or not, this does not change to GCS: 111 which would show 'consent granted'\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? How do I get this to work properly?\n\nThe odd thing is, even though GTM says consent denied, after accepting cookies, I can see a pageview on UA, meaning that the cookie banner is working as it should, but why is it the case that GTM say's its not granted?\n\nBased on what I'm seeing in GTM, would this mean that no conversions would this mean that no conversions would be reported in Google Ads? And is it true that If you don't see any GCS parameter in the network console, this means that consent mode is not configured? The fact that I can see parameters means consent mode is working somewhat?\n\nThe reason I ask this is we had OneTrust set up before using GTM tags, as we had old gtags on our site and although conversions were still being reported in GA4 & UA, we had 0 conversions coming through in Google ads as consent was not configured at the time. Based on this current set up, if all traffic is being set to denied, would Google ads just only show modelled conversions?\n\nWhat would be the cause of the issues we're seeing? What is the perfect way to set up consent mode?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any feedback on this matter. \n\nThanks!",

                "body": "This is my area of expertise. It’s early and I haven’t had any coffee, but at first glance this sounds like Consent Mode has not been switched on inside OneTrust. Or, if it has been switched on then the OneTrust config needs to be published to make the change live.\n\nI’ll read your post a bit more carefully after I’m properly awake.\n\nProperly awake edit:\n\nYou say you have CoMo switched on in OneTrust, but can you confirm you've re-published the OneTrust script afterward? This is exactly what a client of mine recently forgot to do and ended up with exactly what you're seeing.\n\nIt might not be 100% criticial, but I would ensure your scripts are in this order:-\n\n1. The Consent Mode \"default\" script. *Please also add* `wait_for_update: 500` *as the final line in that script.*\n2. Any existing data layer pushes for e.g. global variables (you might not have this at all, it's not required)\n3. GTM\n4. OneTrust\n\nI'm more inclined to rely on GTM being able to pick up all of the events OneTrust pushes to the data layer if GTM loads before OneTrust does.\n\nGoogle native tags firing prior to consent / with consent denied is entirely normal with Google Consent Mode. Once it's working and you see the 'update' that sets gcs=G111, look in the network tab and you'll see UA and GA4 both re-sending the previous hit (where gcs was G100) with some subtle indicators to the platform about why the hit was sent i.e. it's not a duplicatation.\n\nYour non-Google tags should not be firing from a standard Initialization, All Pages, DOM Ready or Window Loaded. Facebook, Hotjar, TikTok etc should all move to firing on the OneTrustGroupsUpdated trigger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven **more** awake edit:\n\nI'd missed the part where you added a CoMo update script to the <body>. You should remove that. OneTrust will take care of issuing the correct CoMo update command.\n\nEven with everything else  working as expected, by pushing ad\\_storage: \"granted\" in the update, you would defaulting all users to gcs=G110 without their consent, which is also not enough consent for UA or GA4 to fire (both ad\\_storage and analytics\\_storage must be granted).\n\nYou'll also be interfering with OneTrust's own issuance of the update command, which it does immediately prior to pushing OneTrustGroupsUpdated to the data layer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA mostly good example of a working implementation: https://www.magnet.co.uk/",

Hasn’t fired for 7 months. I updated the conversion ID in GTM, and it started firing again. I added all pages in GTM for the tag to fire. What is puzzling is I have no idea where this event specific code is placed. Any ideas? There was a tag associated with it but it’s been deleted.\n\n**Main conversion Part 2**\n\n* Trail\\_test = page load. If [x.com/orderlp/plan1/payment](http://x.com/orderlp/plan1/payment) OR [x.com/orderlp/plan2/payment](http://x.com/orderlp/plan2/payment) etc (up to 4 plan) loads, it should fire. It doesn’t. It only fires for plan 4. I created this as a test to see if page load works.\n* Trial\\_test-orderlp&pay = page load. If URL contains orderlp AND payment, it should fire. It doesn’t\n\n**Supporting conversions** = page load. 3 of them are unverified, and the pro annual (plan 4) is the only one that fires and that one is the least popular one. The most popular ones do not fire the conversion. I created these as a test to see if page load works.\n\n**Secondary Conversion** \\- Linkedin - Trial Pro Monthly. This is also an event-specific conversion. I have no idea where the tag is, and on top of that, the conversion ID isn’t even inputted in the new linkedin v2 code. I have no idea how this is firing.\n\nAny body have experience or insight regarding this? None of this seems right.",

The condition for a lot of them is that the Page URL is an exact match but your confirmation page always includes a unique query string for each individual submission.  Instead of using strict equality on the full URL, you need to base your trigger conditions on either pathname or use the contains or matches comparison.\n2.  I've inspected most of the forms that I've seen on the page and none of the form submission buttons actually match the classes that are required in your triggers.\n3.  Even if the form submission buttons did match the classes in the triggers, every single one of these forms is contained within an iframe, meaning you do not have access to any HTML or event within it.\n\n\n\nOther things I've noticed:\n\n* This site asks for the users consent and then proceeds to dump a shit ton of trackers no matter what the users choice was.\n* The GTM container is loaded from some kind of wrapper function that often takes a really long time to execute. At one point I had to wait around 15 seconds before the container was actually injected.\n* There are other google scripts and trackers from other vendors being loaded outside of the GTM container. There seems to be no control or structure regarding any of these trackers.\n\n  \nGood luck!",

I typically enable all of them, not sure if that's against any best practice but it has always helped me especially when I'm debugging a website that i'm unfamiliar with. I guarantee there's some valuable information that has been hidden in your debug sessions so far because they've been disabled.    \n\n\nNext, as I said initially, the Schedule Consultation form is a Hubspot form. I sent a test lead, then clicked on the \"Click\" event on the left side of GTM preview (when you enable all the built-in variables, you'll see form submit variable here as well), then I looked in the Variables tab at the **Click Text** variable. The 'value' looks like a random string of numbers and letters.. but there's at least 1 important piece of info that you'll eventually report on via a dataLayer variable for: form ID.  The other obvious tell that it's a Hubspot form and someone called it out in their comment.. Hubspot forms tend to append the ?submissionguid= at the end of the thank-you page URL. The trigger you'll need likely hasn't been created yet. \n\nI've got a link to a blog that outlines what steps you'll have to take. It's pretty straight forward assuming you've got access to the Hubspot portal where you'll grab your tracking code. After that, it's some straightforward Tag Manager work and you're set.  Also, whoever managed this Container prior to you, yikes. But that's not your fault, this is an easy clean-up. \n\nIf you need help reply on here and I'll follow up. or DM me for the blog/instructions.",

It's a whole different thing regarding checkout page customizations.\n\nHowever, you can still add conversion tracking code on any plan. It can be done easily using custom pixel. [https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/pixels/custom-pixels/gtm-tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/pixels/custom-pixels/gtm-tutorial)\n\nAnother  way is through the Additional scripts section. Although it has been deprecated but will work until Aug 2025 IIRC.

Cannot directly find the Google Tag: this will throw an error. The reason I am thinking this is because there are URL's in our Tag Coverage that are all \"old\" urls that are redirected to new urls. So, somewhere on Page A, we link to Page B, but that page redirects to Page C. Google will still \"scrape\" Page B, see there is no code and will report on it.  \nsomething like that",

Anyway, I just found this (below) at the same time as your post! I've been having the same problem, [www](http://www). is tagged for my homepage, non www is not tagged for my homepage. Here is the link, it's the bottom of this page [https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/12270036?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-google-tag-manager](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/12270036?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-google-tag-manager)\n\n# Identify false positives and duplicates\n\nTag diagnostics may falsely raise warnings in the *Untagged Page* section of Tag coverage when a page is correctly tagged. The following are the most common reasons why this might happen and how you can fix these issues when they arise:\n\n* **Low Traffic**: Pages with low traffic might be mistakenly identified as untagged, even if they’re intentionally low-traffic pages. For example, thank you pages after ordering an item might be flagged as untagged pages.\n* **Redirects**: Pages that serve as redirects (for example, from [http://example.com](http://example.com) to http://www.example.com) might be mistakenly flagged.\n* **Trailing Backslashes**: Pages with and without trailing slashes (for example, [http://www.example.com/](http://www.example.com/) and http://www.example.com) can cause the same page to be flagged twice as untagged.\n* **Capitalization**: Variations in URL capitalization can lead to the same page being flagged as separate untagged pages. For example, [http://www.example.com/ABC](http://www.example.com/ABC) and [http://www.example.com/abc](http://www.example.com/abc) might be mistakenly flagged as separate pages.\n\nTo fix these common issues:\n\n* Verify that your page is correctly tagged using [Tag Assistant](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/10039345). If the untagged page was falsely identified as untagged, but Tag Assistant confirms that your tag is properly implemented and firing, this diagnostic alert should resolve itself within 24 hours.\n* Ignore the page in Tag coverage if you believe that the page isn't relevant to your website, which will remove the issue from appearing about the page. You can always add the page back into Tag coverage later.",
